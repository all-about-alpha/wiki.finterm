# 80-20 Rule

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：80-20法则，又称帕累托法则（Pareto Principle），由意大利经济学家维尔弗雷多·帕累托（Vilfredo Pareto）于19世纪末提出。该法则指出，在许多情况下，大约80%的结果往往由20%的原因所导致。例如，80%的财富可能由20%的人掌握，或80%的销售额可能来自20%的客户。  
  **English Explanation**: The 80-20 Rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, was proposed by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in the late 19th century. It states that, in many scenarios, roughly 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes. For example, 80% of wealth may be held by 20% of the population, or 80% of sales may come from 20% of customers.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：80-20法则广泛应用于商业、经济学、时间管理等领域。例如，企业可以通过识别贡献80%利润的20%客户，优化资源分配；个人可以利用该法则聚焦于产生最大价值的20%任务，提高效率。需要注意的是，该法则并非精确比例，而是一种趋势性规律，实际应用中需结合具体情境调整。  
  **English Explanation**: The 80-20 Rule is widely applied in business, economics, time management, and other fields. For instance, companies can optimize resource allocation by identifying the 20% of customers who generate 80% of profits; individuals can use the rule to focus on the 20% of tasks that yield the most value, thereby improving efficiency. It is important to note that the rule is not an exact ratio but a trend-based principle, and its application should be adjusted according to specific contexts.
