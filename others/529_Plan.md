## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **529计划** 是一种由美国联邦政府授权、各州政府或教育机构管理的教育储蓄计划，旨在帮助家庭为未来的高等教育费用进行储蓄。该计划得名于美国《国内税收法》第529条，允许投资收益免税增长，并在用于合格教育支出时免税提取。  
  **529 Plan** is a tax-advantaged savings plan authorized by the U.S. federal government and administered by state governments or educational institutions, designed to help families save for future higher education expenses. Named after Section 529 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, it allows investment earnings to grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free when used for qualified education expenses.

  在中国，529计划的概念并不直接适用，但类似的教育储蓄理念可以通过其他金融工具实现，如教育保险或专项储蓄账户。需要注意的是，这些工具可能不具备529计划的税收优惠，且需根据当地法规和金融机构的具体条款操作。

Each state offers its own plan, and some provide additional state tax benefits.
