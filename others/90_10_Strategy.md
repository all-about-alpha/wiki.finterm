# 90/10 Strategy

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：90/10策略是一种投资组合管理策略，通常指将90%的资金投资于低风险资产（如债券或货币市场基金），而将剩余的10%投资于高风险资产（如股票或衍生品）。该策略的核心在于通过低风险资产保障本金安全，同时利用高风险资产追求潜在的高收益。这一策略最早由一些保守型投资者提出，旨在平衡风险与收益。  
  **English Explanation**: The 90/10 Strategy is an investment portfolio management approach where 90% of the funds are allocated to low-risk assets (such as bonds or money market funds), while the remaining 10% is invested in high-risk assets (such as stocks or derivatives). The core concept is to protect the principal through low-risk investments while seeking potential high returns from high-risk assets. This strategy was initially proposed by conservative investors to balance risk and reward.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：90/10策略常用于退休规划或保守型投资者的资产配置中。例如，临近退休的投资者可能将大部分资金投入国债或定期存款，以保障本金安全，同时用小部分资金参与股市以获取额外收益。需要注意的是，尽管该策略风险较低，但10%的高风险投资仍可能带来损失，投资者需根据自身风险承受能力调整比例。  
  **English Application**: The 90/10 Strategy is often used in retirement planning or by conservative investors for asset allocation. For instance, investors nearing retirement might allocate the majority of their funds to government bonds or fixed deposits to safeguard their principal, while using a small portion to invest in the stock market for additional returns. It is important to note that while this strategy is low-risk, the 10% allocated to high-risk investments can still result in losses, and investors should adjust the ratio based on their risk tolerance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，90/10策略符合稳健投资的原则，适合风险厌恶型投资者。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了一种简单且有效的资产配置方法，尤其适合长期投资目标。在行业层面，该策略被广泛用于养老金管理和保险资金投资，因其能够在保障资金安全的同时实现适度增值。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the 90/10 Strategy aligns with the principles of prudent investing and is suitable for risk-averse investors. From an investment standpoint, it offers a simple yet effective asset allocation method, particularly for long-term investment goals.
