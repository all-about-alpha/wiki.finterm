# 100 Minus Your Age Rule

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “100减去你的年龄法则”是一种简单的资产配置策略，建议投资者将100减去自己的年龄，得出的数字即为应投资于股票等高风险资产的比例，剩余部分则投资于债券等低风险资产。该法则由美国投资顾问在20世纪中期提出，旨在帮助个人根据年龄调整投资组合的风险水平。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The "100 Minus Your Age Rule" is a straightforward asset allocation strategy that suggests subtracting your age from 100 to determine the percentage of your portfolio that should be invested in high-risk assets like stocks, with the remainder allocated to low-risk assets such as bonds. This rule was popularized by American financial advisors in the mid-20th century to help individuals adjust their investment risk based on their age.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：  
  该法则适用于个人投资者，尤其是那些缺乏专业金融知识但希望实现长期财富增长的人。例如，一个30岁的人可以将70%的资金投入股票，30%投入债券。然而，随着市场环境和个人风险承受能力的变化，这一比例可能需要调整。投资者需注意，该法则过于简化，未考虑通胀、收入水平、财务目标等因素。  
  **English Application**：  
  This rule is suitable for individual investors, particularly those without extensive financial expertise but seeking long-term wealth growth. For example, a 30-year-old might allocate 70% to stocks and 30% to bonds. However, this ratio may need adjustment based on market conditions and personal risk tolerance. Investors should note that the rule oversimplifies factors like inflation, income levels, and financial goals.
