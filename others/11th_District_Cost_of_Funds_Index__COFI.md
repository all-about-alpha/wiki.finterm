## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：第11区资金成本指数（COFI）是美国联邦住房贷款银行（FHLB）第11区（包括加利福尼亚州、亚利桑那州和内华达州）计算的一种利率指数。它反映了该区域内储蓄机构（如储蓄银行和信用合作社）的资金成本，通常用于调整可调利率抵押贷款（ARM）的利率。  
  - **English Explanation**: The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is an interest rate index calculated by the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of the 11th District, which includes California, Arizona, and Nevada. It reflects the cost of funds for savings institutions (such as savings banks and credit unions) in the region and is commonly used to adjust the interest rates of Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs).

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：COFI主要用于可调利率抵押贷款（ARM）的利率调整。借款人需注意，COFI的波动可能影响其月供金额，尤其是在利率上升周期中。此外，COFI的计算基于历史数据，因此其变化可能滞后于市场利率的实时变动。  
  - **English Application**: COFI is primarily used to adjust the interest rates of Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs). Borrowers should be aware that fluctuations in COFI can impact their monthly payments, especially during periods of rising interest rates. Additionally, since COFI is based on historical data, its changes may lag behind real-time market rate movements.
