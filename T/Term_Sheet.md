# Term Sheet

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  条款清单（Term Sheet）是投资方与被投资方在正式签署投资协议前，就投资条款达成初步共识的非约束性文件。它通常由投资方起草，涵盖了投资金额、估值、股权比例、股东权利、退出机制等核心条款。条款清单的目的是为后续的正式协议谈判奠定基础，但其本身通常不具备法律约束力（除非特别注明）。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Term Sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms and conditions of an investment agreement between investors and the company seeking investment. It is typically drafted by the investors and includes core terms such as investment amount, valuation, equity stake, shareholder rights, and exit mechanisms. The purpose of a Term Sheet is to establish a foundation for subsequent formal agreement negotiations, though it is generally not legally binding (unless explicitly stated otherwise).
