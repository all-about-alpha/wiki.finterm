# Tax Wedge

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：税收楔子（Tax Wedge）是指政府通过税收政策在劳动者工资和雇主支付的总成本之间形成的差额。它反映了劳动者实际获得的收入与雇主实际支付的劳动力成本之间的差距，通常包括个人所得税、社会保险费和其他相关税费。这一概念由经济学家提出，用于衡量税收对劳动力市场的扭曲效应。  
  **English Explanation**: The tax wedge refers to the difference between the wages earned by employees and the total labor costs borne by employers, created by government tax policies. It reflects the gap between the net income received by workers and the gross labor costs paid by employers, typically including income taxes, social security contributions, and other related taxes. This concept, introduced by economists, is used to measure the distortionary effects of taxation on the labor market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：税收楔子常用于分析劳动力市场的效率、劳动者的工作积极性以及企业的用工成本。例如，在制定个人所得税或社会保险政策时，政府会评估税收楔子对就业和经济增长的影响。需要注意的是，过高的税收楔子可能抑制劳动者的工作意愿或增加企业的负担，从而影响经济活力。  
  **English Application**: The tax wedge is commonly used to analyze labor market efficiency, worker motivation, and employer labor costs. For instance, when formulating income tax or social security policies, governments assess the impact of the tax wedge on employment and economic growth. It is important to note that an excessively high tax wedge may discourage workers or increase the burden on employers, thereby affecting economic vitality.
