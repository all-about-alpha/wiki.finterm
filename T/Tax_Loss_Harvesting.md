# Tax Loss Harvesting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：税损收割（Tax Loss Harvesting）是一种税务优化策略，指投资者通过出售已亏损的资产，以抵消资本利得税或普通所得税的负债。这一策略的核心在于利用投资亏损来减少税务负担，同时保持投资组合的整体策略不变。  
  **English Explanation**: Tax Loss Harvesting is a tax optimization strategy where investors sell assets that have incurred losses to offset capital gains taxes or ordinary income taxes. The core concept is to use investment losses to reduce tax liabilities while maintaining the overall investment strategy.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：税损收割常用于高净值个人或机构投资者的投资组合管理中。例如，当某只股票价格下跌时，投资者可以卖出该股票以确认亏损，从而抵消其他投资带来的资本利得税。需要注意的是，这一策略需遵守“洗售规则”（Wash Sale Rule），即不能在卖出亏损资产后30天内重新买入相同或高度相似的资产，否则亏损将不被税务机构认可。  
  **English Explanation**: Tax Loss Harvesting is commonly used in portfolio management by high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors. For example, if a stock's price drops, an investor can sell it to realize a loss, offsetting capital gains taxes from other investments. It is important to adhere to the "Wash Sale Rule," which prohibits repurchasing the same or substantially identical asset within 30 days of selling it; otherwise, the loss will not be recognized by tax authorities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，税损收割是合法的税务规划手段，但需严格遵守相关法规。从投资角度看，它有助于提升税后收益，优化投资组合的长期表现。从行业角度看，这一策略被广泛应用于财富管理和资产管理领域，成为投资者税务规划的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Tax Loss Harvesting is a legitimate tax planning tool but must comply with relevant laws. From an investment perspective, it helps enhance after-tax returns and optimize long-term portfolio performance. From an industry perspective, this strategy is widely used in wealth and asset management, making it a crucial tool for investor tax planning.
