# Tag-Along Rights

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  跟随权（Tag-Along Rights）是一种股东权利，通常出现在股东协议或投资协议中。它赋予少数股东在公司控制权发生变更时，有权要求将其股份以与大股东相同的条件出售给第三方。这一权利旨在保护少数股东的利益，防止大股东在不公平的条件下出售股份，从而损害少数股东的权益。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Tag-Along Rights are a type of shareholder right, typically included in shareholder agreements or investment agreements. They grant minority shareholders the right to require that their shares be sold to a third party under the same terms as the majority shareholder in the event of a change in control of the company. This right is designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders, preventing majority shareholders from selling their shares under unfair conditions that could harm minority shareholders.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  跟随权通常应用于私募股权投资、风险投资或并购交易中。例如，当大股东计划将其股份出售给第三方时，少数股东可以行使跟随权，要求以相同的价格和条件出售其股份。这一权利有助于确保少数股东在公司控制权变更时不会被迫接受不利条件。需要注意的是，跟随权的行使通常需要满足一定的条件，例如出售股份的比例或交易金额达到特定门槛。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  Tag-Along Rights are commonly applied in private equity investments, venture capital, or mergers and acquisitions. For example, when a majority shareholder plans to sell their shares to a third party, minority shareholders can exercise their tag-along rights to require that their shares be sold under the same terms and conditions. This right helps ensure that minority shareholders are not forced to accept unfavorable terms during a change in control. It is important to note that the exercise of tag-along rights often requires certain conditions to be met, such as a specific threshold for the proportion of shares sold or the transaction amount.
