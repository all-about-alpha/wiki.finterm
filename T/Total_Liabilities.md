# Total Liabilities

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：总负债（Total Liabilities）是指企业在某一特定时点所承担的全部债务和义务的总和，包括流动负债和非流动负债。流动负债是指在一年内需要偿还的债务，如应付账款、短期借款等；非流动负债是指偿还期限超过一年的债务，如长期借款、应付债券等。总负债是企业资产负债表的重要组成部分，反映了企业的财务结构和偿债能力。  
  **English Explanation**: Total Liabilities refer to the sum of all debts and obligations that a company owes at a specific point in time, including both current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Current liabilities are debts that need to be repaid within one year, such as accounts payable and short-term loans, while non-current liabilities are debts with a repayment period exceeding one year, such as long-term loans and bonds payable. Total Liabilities are a crucial component of a company's balance sheet, reflecting its financial structure and debt repayment capacity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：总负债常用于企业财务分析中，帮助投资者、债权人和管理层评估企业的财务健康状况。例如，通过计算资产负债率（总负债/总资产），可以判断企业的财务杠杆水平和偿债风险。高负债率可能意味着企业面临较大的财务压力，而低负债率则可能表明企业财务稳健。  
  **English Application**: Total Liabilities are commonly used in corporate financial analysis to help investors, creditors, and management assess a company's financial health. For example, by calculating the debt-to-asset ratio (Total Liabilities/Total Assets), one can evaluate the company's financial leverage and debt repayment risk. A high debt ratio may indicate significant financial pressure, while a low debt ratio suggests financial stability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，总负债是评估企业财务合规性和风险控制的重要指标；从投资角度看，它是衡量企业财务风险和投资价值的关键因素；从行业角度看，总负债水平反映了行业的资本结构和竞争态势。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Total Liabilities are a key metric for assessing a company's financial compliance and risk control. From an investment standpoint, they are a critical factor in evaluating a company's financial risk and investment value. From an industry perspective, the level of Total Liabilities reflects the capital structure and competitive dynamics of the industry.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：总负债的概念起源于复式记账法的应用。15世纪，意大利数学家卢卡·帕乔利（Luca Pacioli）在其著作《算术、几何、比与比例概要》中首次系统阐述了复式记账法，奠定了现代会计学的基础。总负债作为资产负债表的一部分，随着企业财务管理的规范化而逐渐成为核心指标。

In the 15th century, Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli systematically explained double-entry bookkeeping in his work "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita," laying the foundation for modern accounting. As part of the balance sheet, Total Liabilities gradually became a core metric with the standardization of corporate financial management.
