# Trial Balance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：试算表（Trial Balance）是会计工作中用于验证账簿记录是否平衡的一种表格。它汇总了所有总分类账户的借方和贷方余额，确保借贷双方总额相等。试算表的核心概念是“借贷平衡”，即会计等式“资产 = 负债 + 所有者权益”的体现。  
  **English Explanation**: A Trial Balance is a statement used in accounting to verify the accuracy of ledger entries by summarizing the debit and credit balances of all general ledger accounts. Its core concept is the "balance of debits and credits," reflecting the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

  **English Explanation**: The Trial Balance is primarily used at the end of an accounting period to ensure the accuracy of ledger entries. It also serves as a foundational tool for preparing financial statements, such as the balance sheet and income statement. However, it can only detect imbalances in totals, not errors like omissions or duplicate entries.
