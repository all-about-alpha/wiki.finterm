# Too Big to Fail

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “Too Big to Fail”（大而不倒）是指某些金融机构因其规模庞大、业务复杂或与整个金融系统的关联性极强，以至于其倒闭将对整个经济体系造成灾难性影响。因此，政府或监管机构通常会采取救助措施，以防止这些机构的破产。这一概念最早在20世纪80年代的美国银行业危机中被广泛讨论，并在2008年全球金融危机中再次成为焦点。  
  **English Explanation**  
  "Too Big to Fail" refers to certain financial institutions that are so large, complex, or interconnected with the broader financial system that their failure would have catastrophic consequences for the entire economy. As a result, governments or regulators often intervene to bail out these institutions to prevent their collapse. This concept gained prominence during the U.S. banking crisis in the 1980s and became a central issue again during the 2008 global financial crisis.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  “大而不倒”通常应用于大型银行、保险公司或其他系统性重要的金融机构。例如，2008年金融危机期间，美国政府对花旗集团、美国国际集团（AIG）等机构的救助就是典型的“大而不倒”案例。然而，这种救助行为也引发了道德风险问题，即这些机构可能因预期政府救助而承担过度风险。  
  **English Application**  
  "Too Big to Fail" is typically applied to large banks, insurance companies, or other systemically important financial institutions. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. government's bailouts of Citigroup and AIG were classic examples of "Too Big to Fail." However, such bailouts also raise concerns about moral hazard, as these institutions may take excessive risks with the expectation of government intervention.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，“大而不倒”问题促使各国加强了对系统性重要金融机构的监管，例如实施更高的资本要求和制定“生前遗嘱”（即破产预案）。从投资角度看，投资者可能更倾向于投资这些被认为“大而不倒”的机构，认为其风险较低。从行业角度看，这一概念推动了金融行业的整合，但也加剧了市场集中度。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the "Too Big to Fail" issue has led to stricter oversight of systemically important financial institutions, such as higher capital requirements and the implementation of "living wills" (bankruptcy plans). From an investment perspective, investors may prefer to invest in these "Too Big to Fail" institutions, perceiving them as lower risk. From an industry perspective, this concept has driven consolidation in the financial sector but also increased market concentration.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  “大而不倒”的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪80年代的美国银行业危机。当时，美国大陆伊利诺伊银行因过度扩张而濒临破产，但由于其规模庞大，美国政府选择对其进行救助。2008年全球金融危机期间，这一概念再次成为焦点，雷曼兄弟的倒闭引发了全球金融市场的动荡，而美国政府随后对多家大型金融机构实施了救助。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of "Too Big to Fail" can be traced back to the U.S. banking crisis in the 1980s. At that time, Continental Illinois Bank faced imminent collapse due to overexpansion, but the U.S. government chose to bail it out because of its size. During the 2008 global financial crisis, this concept regained prominence when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered global financial turmoil, leading the U.S. government to bail out several large financial institutions.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  “大而不倒”现象对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。它促使各国加强了对大型金融机构的监管，例如《多德-弗兰克法案》的出台。然而，这也引发了关于公平竞争和市场效率的争议，因为小型金融机构可能无法获得同样的政府支持。目前，许多国家仍在探索如何平衡金融稳定与市场竞争之间的关系。  
  **English Impact**  
  The "Too Big to Fail" phenomenon has had a profound impact on the global financial system. It has led to stricter regulation of large financial institutions, such as the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. However, it has also sparked debates about fair competition and market efficiency, as smaller institutions may not receive the same level of government support. Currently, many countries are still exploring how to balance financial stability with market competition.
