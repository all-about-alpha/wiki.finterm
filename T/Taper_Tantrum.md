  The term "Taper Tantrum" refers to the significant market volatility that occurred in 2013 when the Federal Reserve announced its intention to gradually reduce its quantitative easing (QE) program.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  缩减恐慌主要应用于金融市场分析，特别是在讨论央行政策调整对市场情绪和资产价格的影响时。投资者需警惕央行政策转向可能引发的市场波动，尤其是在新兴市场，资本外流和货币贬值风险较高。  
  **English Application**  
  The Taper Tantrum is primarily used in financial market analysis, especially when discussing the impact of central bank policy adjustments on market sentiment and asset prices. Investors need to be cautious about potential market volatility triggered by shifts in central bank policies, particularly in emerging markets where risks of capital outflows and currency depreciation are higher.

* **重要性 / Significance**

  缩减恐慌事件凸显了央行政策透明度的重要性，以及市场对流动性变化的敏感性。从监管角度看，央行需谨慎传达政策意图以避免市场过度反应；从投资角度看，投资者需关注政策变化对资产配置的影响；从行业角度看，金融机构需加强风险管理以应对市场波动。  
  **English Significance**

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  缩减恐慌的起源可追溯至2013年5月22日，时任美联储主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）在国会作证时暗示，美联储可能在未来几个月内开始缩减其每月850亿美元的资产购买计划。这一表态引发市场对流动性减少的担忧，导致美国国债收益率急剧上升，全球股市和新兴市场资产大幅下跌。  
  **English Origin**  
  The Taper Tantrum originated on May 22, 2013, when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before Congress and hinted that the Fed might begin tapering its $85 billion monthly asset purchase program in the coming months. This statement sparked fears of reduced liquidity, causing a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields and significant declines in global stock markets and emerging market assets.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  缩减恐慌对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。美国国债收益率飙升，导致全球借贷成本上升；新兴市场遭受资本外流和货币贬值压力，印度、巴西等国尤为严重。此后，美联储在政策沟通上更加谨慎，市场也逐渐适应了政策正常化的节奏。  
  **English Impact**  
  The Taper Tantrum had a profound impact on global financial markets. The surge in U.S. Treasury yields led to higher borrowing costs worldwide, while emerging markets faced capital outflows and currency depreciation, particularly in countries like India and Brazil. Since then, the Fed has become more cautious in its policy communication, and markets have gradually adapted to the pace of policy normalization.
