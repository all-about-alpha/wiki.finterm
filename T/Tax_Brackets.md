# Tax Brackets

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：税级（Tax Brackets）是指根据个人或企业的收入水平划分的不同税率区间。每个税级对应一个特定的税率，收入越高，适用的税率通常也越高。这一制度旨在实现税收的累进性，确保高收入者承担更多的税负。  
  **English Explanation**: Tax brackets refer to the ranges of income levels that are subject to different tax rates for individuals or businesses. Each bracket corresponds to a specific tax rate, with higher income levels generally subject to higher rates. This system aims to achieve progressive taxation, ensuring that those with higher incomes bear a greater tax burden.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：税级广泛应用于个人所得税和企业所得税的计算中。例如，在中国，个人所得税采用七级超额累进税率，收入越高，适用的税率越高。在实际应用中，纳税人需要根据自身收入水平确定适用的税级，并计算应纳税额。需要注意的是，跨税级时可能会出现边际税率的变化，需谨慎规划税务。  
  **English Explanation**: Tax brackets are widely used in calculating personal and corporate income taxes. For example, in China, personal income tax adopts a seven-tier progressive tax rate system, where higher income levels are subject to higher rates. In practice, taxpayers need to determine the applicable tax bracket based on their income level and calculate the tax payable. It is important to note that crossing into a higher tax bracket may result in changes to the marginal tax rate, requiring careful tax planning.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：税级制度在税收政策中具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它有助于实现税收公平，调节收入分配；从投资角度看，税级影响个人和企业的税后收入，进而影响投资决策；从行业角度看，税级设计会影响不同行业的税负水平，从而影响行业竞争力。  
  **English Explanation**: The tax bracket system plays a significant role in tax policy. From a regulatory perspective, it helps achieve tax fairness and income redistribution. From an investment perspective, tax brackets affect the after-tax income of individuals and businesses, influencing investment decisions. From an industry perspective, the design of tax brackets impacts the tax burden across different sectors, thereby affecting industry competitiveness.
