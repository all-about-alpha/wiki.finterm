* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：传统IRA（Individual Retirement Account，个人退休账户）是一种由美国政府支持的退休储蓄账户，允许个人在税前基础上存入资金，投资收益在账户内免税增长，直到退休后取款时才需缴纳所得税。该账户由1974年的《雇员退休收入保障法》（ERISA）创立，旨在鼓励个人为退休储蓄。  
  **English Explanation**: A Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a U.S. government-supported retirement savings account that allows individuals to contribute pre-tax income. The investment earnings grow tax-deferred within the account, and taxes are only paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
