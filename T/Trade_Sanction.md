  **English Explanation**  
  Trade sanctions refer to measures taken by one or more countries to restrict or prohibit trade with a target country or region, aiming to achieve political, economic, or military objectives. Typically initiated by international organizations (e.g., the United Nations) or sovereign states, they are designed to compel the target country to alter its policies or behaviors. Key concepts include trade restrictions, economic pressure, and international relations adjustments.

* **应用 / Application**

  贸易制裁常用于应对国际冲突、人权问题或核扩散等全球性挑战。例如，联合国对朝鲜的核计划实施贸易制裁，限制其进出口活动。应用时需注意，贸易制裁可能引发目标国家的反制措施，甚至导致全球经济波动。  
  **English Application**  
  Trade sanctions are often used to address global challenges such as international conflicts, human rights violations, or nuclear proliferation. For example, the United Nations imposed trade sanctions on North Korea to restrict its nuclear program by limiting its import and export activities. When applying sanctions, it is important to note that they may provoke retaliatory measures from the target country and potentially cause global economic fluctuations.
