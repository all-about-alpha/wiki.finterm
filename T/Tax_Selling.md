  **中文应用场景**  
  税损卖出常用于个人投资者和机构投资者在年底前调整投资组合，以减少当年的税务负担。例如，投资者可能会卖出表现不佳的股票，以抵消其他投资带来的资本收益。需要注意的是，税损卖出需遵守“洗售规则”（Wash Sale Rule），即在卖出亏损证券后30天内不能回购相同或 substantially identical 的证券，否则损失将不被税务机构认可。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Tax Selling is commonly used by individual and institutional investors to adjust their portfolios before year-end to reduce tax liabilities for the current year. For instance, investors might sell underperforming stocks to offset capital gains from other investments. It is important to note that Tax Selling must comply with the "Wash Sale Rule," which prohibits repurchasing the same or substantially identical securities within 30 days of selling at a loss; otherwise, the loss will not be recognized by tax authorities.
