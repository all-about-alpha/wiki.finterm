# Title Insurance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：产权保险（Title Insurance）是一种保险产品，旨在保护房地产所有者或贷款人免受因产权缺陷或所有权纠纷而导致的财务损失。产权缺陷可能包括未公开的留置权、产权欺诈、登记错误或法律纠纷等。产权保险通常在房地产交易过程中购买，分为业主保单和贷款人保单两种类型。  
  **English Explanation**: Title insurance is a form of insurance that protects real estate owners or lenders from financial losses due to title defects or ownership disputes. Title defects may include undisclosed liens, title fraud, recording errors, or legal disputes. Title insurance is typically purchased during real estate transactions and comes in two forms: owner's policies and lender's policies.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：产权保险主要用于房地产交易中，确保买方或贷款人在购买房产后不会因产权问题遭受损失。例如，在房屋买卖过程中，买方通常会购买业主保单，而贷款机构则要求贷款人保单以保障其贷款安全。需要注意的是，产权保险通常是一次性费用，且仅在交易时生效，不覆盖未来可能出现的产权问题。  
  **English Application**: Title insurance is primarily used in real estate transactions to ensure that buyers or lenders are protected from losses due to title issues after purchasing a property. For example, in a home purchase, the buyer typically purchases an owner's policy, while the lender requires a lender's policy to secure the loan. It is important to note that title insurance is usually a one-time fee and only takes effect at the time of the transaction, not covering future title issues.
