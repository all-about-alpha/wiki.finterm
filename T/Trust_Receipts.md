# Trust Receipts

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  信托收据（Trust Receipts）是一种金融工具，通常用于国际贸易和融资中。它是由银行或其他金融机构向进口商提供的一种短期融资方式。进口商在未支付货款的情况下，可以通过信托收据从银行获得货物所有权，并在销售货物后偿还贷款。信托收据的核心概念是“信托”，即银行将货物所有权暂时转移给进口商，但保留对货物的控制权，直到贷款被偿还。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Trust Receipt is a financial instrument commonly used in international trade and financing. It is a short-term financing method provided by banks or other financial institutions to importers. Under a trust receipt, the importer can obtain ownership of goods without paying the full amount upfront and repays the loan after selling the goods. The core concept of a trust receipt is "trust," where the bank temporarily transfers ownership of the goods to the importer while retaining control over the goods until the loan is repaid.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  信托收据广泛应用于国际贸易中，特别是在进口商需要资金周转但无法立即支付货款的情况下。例如，进口商从国外采购大宗商品时，可以通过信托收据获得货物并销售，再用销售收入偿还银行贷款。需要注意的是，信托收据存在一定的风险，如进口商未能按时销售货物或市场价格波动导致还款困难。  
  **English Application**  
  Trust receipts are widely used in international trade, especially when importers need working capital but cannot pay for goods immediately. For example, an importer purchasing bulk commodities from abroad can use a trust receipt to obtain the goods, sell them, and then repay the bank with the sales proceeds. However, trust receipts carry risks, such as the importer failing to sell the goods on time or market price fluctuations causing repayment difficulties.
