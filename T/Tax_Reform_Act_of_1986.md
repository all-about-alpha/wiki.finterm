## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  20世纪80年代初，美国税制复杂且漏洞众多，高税率导致避税行为盛行。1984年，里根政府提出税制改革计划，经过两年多的国会辩论和修改，最终于1986年10月22日签署成为法律。这一改革被认为是里根经济政策的重要组成部分，旨在通过减税和简化税制刺激经济增长。  

  **English Origin**  
  In the early 1980s, the U.S. tax system was complex and riddled with loopholes, with high tax rates leading to widespread tax avoidance. In 1984, the Reagan administration proposed a tax reform plan, which, after over two years of congressional debate and revisions, was signed into law on October 22, 1986. This reform is considered a key component of Reaganomics, aimed at stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and simplification.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**

  **English Impact**  
  The act had a profound impact on the U.S. economy. In the short term, increased consumer spending and corporate investment drove economic growth. In the long term, the broader tax base and lower rates laid the foundation for stable revenue growth.
