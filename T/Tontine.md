# Tontine

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    Tontine（唐提式保险）是一种金融安排，起源于17世纪，由意大利银行家洛伦佐·唐提（Lorenzo Tonti）提出。其核心概念是参与者共同投资一笔资金，定期获得利息或分红。随着参与者逐渐去世，剩余存活者将获得越来越多的收益，直到最后一位存活者获得全部剩余资金。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Tontine is a financial arrangement originating in the 17th century, proposed by Italian banker Lorenzo Tonti. Its core concept involves participants pooling a sum of money and receiving periodic interest or dividends. As participants gradually pass away, the surviving members receive increasingly larger shares of the returns until the last survivor receives the entire remaining fund.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    Tontine曾广泛应用于欧洲的养老金计划和保险产品中，尤其在18-19世纪。其高风险性在于参与者可能为了获得更大收益而采取极端行为（如谋杀），因此现代金融体系中已较少使用。目前，Tontine的概念被部分学者和机构重新研究，用于设计更公平的养老金分配机制。  
  - **English Application**  
    Tontines were widely used in European pension plans and insurance products, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their high-risk nature stems from the potential for participants to engage in extreme actions (such as murder) to maximize their returns, leading to their decline in modern financial systems. Currently, the concept of Tontines is being revisited by some scholars and institutions to design fairer pension distribution mechanisms.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，Tontine因其潜在道德风险而被严格限制；从投资角度看，它为长期储蓄和养老金分配提供了一种独特模式；从行业角度看，其历史演变反映了金融产品设计的复杂性和风险管理的必要性。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, Tontines are heavily restricted due to their inherent moral hazards. From an investment standpoint, they offer a unique model for long-term savings and pension distribution. From an industry perspective, their historical evolution reflects the complexity of financial product design and the necessity of risk management.
