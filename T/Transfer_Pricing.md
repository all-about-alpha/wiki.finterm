# Transfer Pricing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：转移定价（Transfer Pricing）是指跨国企业集团内部各关联企业之间在交易商品、服务、无形资产或资金时，所采用的定价方法。其核心概念是通过内部定价策略，优化集团整体税负，实现利润最大化。转移定价的制定通常受到各国税法和国际税收规则的约束，以避免企业通过人为操纵价格进行避税。  
  **English Explanation**: Transfer pricing refers to the pricing method used between related entities within a multinational enterprise group when trading goods, services, intangible assets, or funds. The core concept is to optimize the overall tax burden of the group and maximize profits through internal pricing strategies. The formulation of transfer pricing is typically constrained by national tax laws and international tax rules to prevent companies from avoiding taxes through artificial price manipulation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：转移定价广泛应用于跨国企业的内部交易中，例如母公司与子公司之间的商品销售、技术授权、服务提供等。在实际操作中，企业需遵循“公平交易原则”（Arm's Length Principle），确保内部交易价格与市场独立交易价格一致。然而，转移定价也可能被滥用，导致税务风险，如被税务机关认定为避税行为而面临罚款或调整。  
  **English Explanation**: Transfer pricing is widely used in internal transactions of multinational enterprises, such as the sale of goods, technology licensing, and service provision between parent companies and subsidiaries. In practice, companies must adhere to the "Arm's Length Principle" to ensure that internal transaction prices align with market-based independent transaction prices. However, transfer pricing can also be abused, leading to tax risks, such as being deemed tax avoidance by tax authorities and facing penalties or adjustments.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，转移定价是各国税务机关关注的重点，因其直接影响税收收入。从投资角度看，合理的转移定价策略有助于企业优化资源配置，提升盈利能力。从行业角度看，转移定价规则的完善有助于维护公平竞争环境，防止跨国企业通过不当定价获取不正当竞争优势。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, transfer pricing is a key focus for tax authorities worldwide, as it directly impacts tax revenue. From an investment perspective, a reasonable transfer pricing strategy helps companies optimize resource allocation and enhance profitability. From an industry perspective, the refinement of transfer pricing rules helps maintain a fair competitive environment and prevents multinational enterprises from gaining unfair advantages through improper pricing.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：转移定价的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初，随着跨国企业的兴起而逐渐形成。1928年，国际联盟（League of Nations）首次提出“公平交易原则”，为转移定价规则奠定了基础。20世纪中后期，随着经济全球化加速，转移定价问题日益突出，各国开始制定相关法规。1995年，经济合作与发展组织（OECD）发布《跨国企业与税务机关转移定价指南》，成为全球转移定价规则的权威参考。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of transfer pricing can be traced back to the early 20th century, gradually forming with the rise of multinational enterprises. In 1928, the League of Nations first proposed the "Arm's Length Principle," laying the foundation for transfer pricing rules. In the mid-to-late 20th century, with the acceleration of economic globalization, transfer pricing issues became increasingly prominent, prompting countries to develop relevant regulations. In 1995, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued the "Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations," which became the authoritative reference for global transfer pricing rules.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：转移定价对全球税务体系产生了深远影响。一方面，它促使各国加强国际合作，共同打击跨国避税行为；另一方面，它也推动了企业税务合规意识的提升。目前，转移定价已成为国际税收领域的重要议题，各国税务机关通过信息交换和联合审计等方式，加强对跨国企业的监管。  
  **English Explanation**: Transfer pricing has had a profound impact on the global tax system. On one hand, it has prompted countries to strengthen international cooperation to combat cross-border tax avoidance. On the other hand, it has also driven the improvement of corporate tax compliance awareness. Currently, transfer pricing has become a key issue in international taxation, with tax authorities worldwide enhancing supervision of multinational enterprises through information exchange and joint audits.
