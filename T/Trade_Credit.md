# Trade Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：贸易信贷（Trade Credit）是指企业在商品或服务交易中，卖方允许买方在约定的期限内延期支付货款的一种短期融资方式。其核心概念包括信用期限、信用额度和信用条件，通常由卖方根据买方的信用状况和交易历史决定。  
  **English Explanation**: Trade credit refers to a short-term financing method where the seller allows the buyer to defer payment for goods or services within an agreed period. Key concepts include credit terms, credit limits, and credit conditions, typically determined by the seller based on the buyer's creditworthiness and transaction history.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：贸易信贷广泛应用于供应链上下游企业之间的交易中，尤其适用于中小企业融资。例如，制造商向供应商采购原材料时，可能获得30天或60天的付款宽限期。风险方面，卖方需评估买方的信用风险，避免坏账损失；买方则需合理规划现金流，避免因延迟付款导致信用受损。  
  **English Application**: Trade credit is widely used in transactions between upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For example, a manufacturer purchasing raw materials from a supplier may receive a payment grace period of 30 or 60 days. Risks include the seller needing to assess the buyer's credit risk to avoid bad debt, while the buyer must manage cash flow to prevent credit damage from delayed payments.
