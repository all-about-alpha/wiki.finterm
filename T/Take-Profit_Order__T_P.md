    止盈订单（Take-Profit Order，简称T/P）是一种预先设定的交易指令，用于在资产价格达到投资者预期的盈利目标时自动平仓。其核心概念是通过锁定利润，避免因市场波动导致盈利回吐。止盈订单通常与止损订单（Stop-Loss Order）结合使用，以管理投资风险。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Take-Profit Order (T/P) is a pre-set trading instruction designed to automatically close a position when the asset price reaches the investor's predetermined profit target.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    止盈订单广泛应用于股票、外汇、期货和加密货币等金融市场。例如，投资者在买入某只股票后，可以设置一个高于买入价的止盈订单，以确保在股价上涨到目标价位时自动卖出，锁定利润。需要注意的是，止盈订单的执行依赖于市场流动性，极端行情下可能出现滑点或无法成交的情况。  
  - **English Application**  
    Take-Profit Orders are widely used in financial markets such as stocks, forex, futures, and cryptocurrencies. For instance, after purchasing a stock, an investor can set a Take-Profit Order at a price higher than the purchase price to ensure automatic selling when the stock reaches the target price, thereby locking in profits. It is important to note that the execution of Take-Profit Orders depends on market liquidity, and in extreme market conditions, slippage or failure to execute may occur.
