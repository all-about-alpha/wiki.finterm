# Tax Shield

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：税盾（Tax Shield）是指企业或个人通过合法的税务筹划手段，利用税法允许的扣除项（如折旧、利息支出等）来减少应纳税所得额，从而降低税负的一种财务策略。其核心概念是通过合理利用税法规定，将部分收入“屏蔽”在应税范围之外，以达到节税的目的。  
  **English Explanation**: A Tax Shield refers to a financial strategy employed by businesses or individuals to reduce taxable income through legally permissible deductions (such as depreciation, interest expenses, etc.), thereby lowering tax liabilities. The core concept revolves around leveraging tax regulations to "shield" a portion of income from taxation, achieving tax savings.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：税盾广泛应用于企业的资本结构优化中，例如通过增加债务融资来利用利息支出的税盾效应。此外，折旧、摊销等非现金支出也是常见的税盾来源。需要注意的是，过度依赖税盾可能导致财务风险增加，如高负债率带来的偿债压力。  
  **English Explanation**: Tax Shields are widely used in optimizing corporate capital structures, such as increasing debt financing to leverage the tax shield effect of interest expenses. Additionally, non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization are common sources of tax shields. However, over-reliance on tax shields may increase financial risks, such as the pressure of high debt levels.
