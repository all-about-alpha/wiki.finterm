## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    理论除权价格（Theoretical Ex-Rights Price, TERP）是指在公司进行配股（Rights Issue）后，股票在除权日的理论市场价格。它反映了配股后公司股票的总市值与新股发行后的总股数之间的关系。TERP的计算通常基于配股前的股价、配股价格以及配股比例。  
    - **核心概念**：配股、除权、市场价格、市值调整。  
    - **提出者**：该概念由金融市场分析人士提出，用于评估配股对股价的影响。  

  - **English Explanation**  
    The Theoretical Ex-Rights Price (TERP) is the theoretical market price of a company's stock after a rights issue, calculated on the ex-rights date. It reflects the relationship between the company's total market capitalization and the total number of shares after the new shares are issued. TERP is typically calculated based on the pre-rights issue stock price, the rights issue price, and the ratio of the rights issue.  
    - **Core Concepts**: Rights issue, ex-rights, market price, market capitalization adjustment.  
    - **Originator**: The concept was developed by financial market analysts to assess the impact of rights issues on stock prices.  

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    TERP主要用于投资者在配股后评估股票的理论价值，帮助判断是否参与配股或调整投资策略。例如，当TERP低于当前市场价格时，可能表明配股后股价有下行压力。  
    - **风险提示**：TERP仅为理论值，实际股价可能受市场情绪、公司基本面等因素影响而偏离TERP。  

  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    TERP is primarily used by investors to evaluate the theoretical value of a stock after a rights issue, aiding in decisions on whether to participate in the rights issue or adjust investment strategies. For instance, if TERP is lower than the current market price, it may indicate potential downward pressure on the stock price post-rights issue.  
    - **Risk Notes**: TERP is a theoretical value, and the actual stock price may deviate due to market sentiment, company fundamentals, and other factors.  

* **重要性 / Significance**

    从监管角度看，TERP有助于评估配股对市场公平性的影响；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了配股后股价的参考基准；从行业角度看，TERP是公司资本运作的重要指标之一。  

  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, TERP helps assess the impact of rights issues on market fairness. From an investment perspective, it provides a reference benchmark for post-rights issue stock prices. From an industry perspective, TERP is a key metric in corporate capital operations.
