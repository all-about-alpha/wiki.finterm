# Target-Date Fund (TDF)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    目标日期基金（Target-Date Fund, TDF）是一种生命周期基金，旨在为投资者提供一种长期投资解决方案，通常用于退休储蓄。该基金的核心概念是根据投资者的目标退休日期（即“目标日期”）自动调整资产配置。随着目标日期的临近，基金会逐步减少高风险资产（如股票）的比例，增加低风险资产（如债券）的比例，以降低投资组合的波动性。  
    目标日期基金最早由美国先锋集团（Vanguard）和富达投资（Fidelity）等机构在20世纪90年代推出，现已成为退休储蓄计划中的主流产品之一。

  - **English Explanation**  
    A Target-Date Fund (TDF) is a type of lifecycle fund designed to provide a long-term investment solution, typically for retirement savings. The core concept of a TDF is to automatically adjust the asset allocation based on the investor's target retirement date (the "target date"). As the target date approaches, the fund gradually reduces the proportion of high-risk assets (such as stocks) and increases the proportion of low-risk assets (such as bonds) to reduce portfolio volatility.  
    Target-Date Funds were first introduced in the 1990s by institutions like Vanguard and Fidelity and have since become a mainstream product in retirement savings plans.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    目标日期基金主要应用于个人退休储蓄计划，如美国的401(k)计划或中国的企业年金计划。投资者只需选择一个与自己预期退休年份接近的目标日期基金，基金经理会根据时间自动调整资产配置，无需投资者频繁操作。  
    需要注意的是，目标日期基金并非完全没有风险。在目标日期临近时，基金仍可能受到市场波动的影响，尤其是在经济不确定性较高的时期。此外，不同基金公司的目标日期基金在资产配置策略上可能存在差异，投资者需仔细选择。

  - **English Application**  
    Target-Date Funds are primarily used in individual retirement savings plans, such as the U.S. 401(k) plan or China's enterprise annuity plans. Investors simply choose a fund with a target date close to their expected retirement year, and the fund manager automatically adjusts the asset allocation over time, eliminating the need for frequent investor intervention.  
    It is important to note that Target-Date Funds are not risk-free. As the target date approaches, the fund may still be affected by market volatility, especially during periods of high economic uncertainty. Additionally, asset allocation strategies may vary between fund providers, so investors should choose carefully.
