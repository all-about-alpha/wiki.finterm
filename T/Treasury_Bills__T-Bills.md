# Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：国库券（T-Bills）是由一国政府发行的短期债务工具，通常期限在一年以内。它们以贴现方式发行，意味着投资者以低于面值的价格购买，到期时按面值赎回，差额即为投资收益。国库券被视为无风险投资，因为其背后有政府信用支持。  
  **English Explanation**: Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by a government, typically with maturities of one year or less. They are sold at a discount, meaning investors purchase them for less than their face value and receive the full face value at maturity, with the difference representing the investment return. T-Bills are considered risk-free investments due to the backing of government credit.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：国库券广泛应用于现金管理、流动性调节和短期投资。企业和金融机构常将其作为低风险资产配置的一部分。投资者需注意利率波动对国库券价格的影响，尽管其违约风险极低，但市场利率上升可能导致价格下跌。  
  **English Explanation**: T-Bills are widely used for cash management, liquidity adjustment, and short-term investments. Corporations and financial institutions often include them as part of their low-risk asset allocation. Investors should be aware of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on T-Bill prices; although the default risk is minimal, rising market interest rates can lead to price declines.
