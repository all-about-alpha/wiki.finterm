# Treasury Stock Method

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：库存股法（Treasury Stock Method）是一种用于计算公司发行在外的股票期权或认股权证对每股收益（EPS）稀释影响的方法。该方法假设公司通过行使期权或认股权证获得的资金用于回购市场上的股票，从而减少流通股数量。核心概念包括“假设回购”和“稀释效应”。  
  **English Explanation**: The Treasury Stock Method is a technique used to calculate the dilutive effect of stock options or warrants on a company's earnings per share (EPS). It assumes that the proceeds from exercising these options or warrants are used to repurchase shares in the market, thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares. Key concepts include "assumed repurchase" and "dilutive effect."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：库存股法常用于财务报表分析中，特别是在计算稀释每股收益（Diluted EPS）时。它适用于公司存在大量股票期权或认股权证的情况。需要注意的是，该方法假设市场上有足够的流动性供公司回购股票，且回购价格等于市场价格。  
  **English Explanation**: The Treasury Stock Method is commonly used in financial statement analysis, particularly when calculating Diluted EPS. It is applicable when a company has a significant number of stock options or warrants outstanding. It is important to note that this method assumes sufficient market liquidity for share repurchases and that the repurchase price equals the market price.
