# Truth in Lending Act (TILA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  《诚实借贷法》（Truth in Lending Act, TILA）是美国联邦法律，于1968年通过，旨在保护消费者在信贷交易中的权益。该法案要求贷款机构向借款人明确披露贷款的关键条款和成本，包括年利率（APR）、总利息费用、还款期限等，以确保消费者能够做出知情的借贷决策。TILA的核心概念是“透明性”和“公平性”，旨在防止贷款机构通过隐藏费用或不明确的条款误导消费者。  

  **English Explanation**  
  The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is a federal law enacted in 1968 in the United States, designed to protect consumers in credit transactions. It requires lenders to clearly disclose key terms and costs of loans, including the annual percentage rate (APR), total interest charges, and repayment terms, ensuring that consumers can make informed borrowing decisions. The core concepts of TILA are "transparency" and "fairness," aiming to prevent lenders from misleading consumers through hidden fees or unclear terms.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  TILA主要适用于个人消费信贷，如信用卡、汽车贷款、住房抵押贷款等。贷款机构必须在借款人签署合同前提供详细的贷款信息，包括总还款金额、利率、还款期限等。此外，TILA还赋予消费者在特定情况下（如住房抵押贷款）的“冷静期”权利，允许其在三天内取消合同。风险提示：消费者需仔细阅读贷款条款，避免因信息不对称而承担不必要的财务负担。  

  **English Application Scenarios**  
  TILA primarily applies to consumer credit, such as credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages. Lenders must provide detailed loan information, including total repayment amount, interest rate, and repayment terms, before the borrower signs the contract. Additionally, TILA grants consumers a "cooling-off period" in certain cases (e.g., home mortgages), allowing them to cancel the contract within three days. Risk Note: Consumers should carefully review loan terms to avoid unnecessary financial burdens due to information asymmetry.

  **English Significance**

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  TILA的制定源于20世纪60年代美国消费者权益保护运动的兴起。当时，许多消费者因贷款条款不透明而陷入债务困境。1968年，美国国会通过了《诚实借贷法》，作为《消费者信用保护法》（Consumer Credit Protection Act）的一部分。该法案的起草者旨在通过法律手段规范贷款机构的行为，确保消费者能够获得清晰的信贷信息。  

  **English Origin**  
  TILA originated from the consumer rights movement in the United States during the 1960s, when many consumers faced debt issues due to opaque loan terms. In 1968, the U.S. Congress passed the Truth in Lending Act as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The drafters aimed to regulate lenders' practices through legislation, ensuring consumers receive clear credit information.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  TILA的实施对美国的信贷市场产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了贷款机构的透明度，还推动了消费者金融教育的普及。如今，TILA已成为全球许多国家制定类似法律的参考范本。尽管TILA在保护消费者方面取得了显著成效，但随着金融产品的复杂化，其条款仍需不断更新以适应新的市场环境。  

  **English Impact**  
  The implementation of TILA has had a profound impact on the U.S. credit market. It not only increased transparency among lenders but also promoted consumer financial education. Today, TILA serves as a reference model for similar laws in many countries worldwide. While TILA has achieved significant success in protecting consumers, its provisions need continuous updates to adapt to evolving market conditions as financial products become more complex.
