## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：信托制度起源于中世纪英国的“用益制”（Use），最初是为了规避封建土地税和宗教限制。13世纪，英国贵族通过将土地转让给受托人，由受托人为受益人管理土地，从而实现了财产的有效传承。现代信托制度在此基础上发展而来，并逐渐在全球范围内推广。  
  **English Explanation**: The trust system originated from the medieval English "Use," initially designed to circumvent feudal land taxes and religious restrictions. In the 13th century, English nobles transferred land to trustees, who managed it for the beneficiaries, enabling effective property succession. The modern trust system evolved from this foundation and has since been adopted globally.
