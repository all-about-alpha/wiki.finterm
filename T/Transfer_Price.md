# Transfer Price

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：转移价格（Transfer Price）是指在同一企业集团内部，不同子公司或部门之间进行商品、服务或无形资产交易时使用的价格。这种价格通常用于内部核算和税务规划，以确保资源在集团内部的合理分配。转移价格的制定需要考虑市场条件、成本结构以及税务法规等因素。  
  **English Explanation**: Transfer Price refers to the price used for transactions of goods, services, or intangible assets between different subsidiaries or departments within the same corporate group. This price is typically used for internal accounting and tax planning purposes to ensure the rational allocation of resources within the group. The determination of transfer prices must consider market conditions, cost structures, and tax regulations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：转移价格广泛应用于跨国企业的内部交易中，特别是在涉及不同国家税务政策的情况下。通过合理设定转移价格，企业可以优化全球税负，但也可能面临税务部门的审查和调整风险。例如，跨国公司可能通过转移价格将利润转移到低税率国家，从而减少整体税负。  
  **English Explanation**: Transfer pricing is widely used in internal transactions of multinational corporations, especially in situations involving different national tax policies. By reasonably setting transfer prices, companies can optimize their global tax burden, but they may also face scrutiny and adjustment risks from tax authorities. For example, multinational corporations might use transfer pricing to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, thereby reducing their overall tax liability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：转移价格在企业管理中具有重要意义，它不仅影响企业的财务表现和税务合规性，还关系到企业的全球战略布局。从监管角度看，各国税务部门对转移价格的审查日益严格，以防止税基侵蚀和利润转移。从投资和行业角度看，合理的转移价格策略有助于提升企业的竞争力和盈利能力。  
  **English Explanation**: Transfer pricing holds significant importance in corporate management, as it not only affects a company's financial performance and tax compliance but also relates to its global strategic positioning. From a regulatory perspective, tax authorities worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing transfer pricing to prevent base erosion and profit shifting. From an investment and industry perspective, a sound transfer pricing strategy can enhance a company's competitiveness and profitability.
