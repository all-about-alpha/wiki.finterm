# Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  问题资产救助计划（Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP）是美国政府于2008年金融危机期间推出的一项紧急救助计划，旨在通过购买或担保金融机构的问题资产（如不良贷款和抵押贷款支持证券）来稳定金融市场。该计划由美国财政部主导，授权资金高达7000亿美元，旨在防止金融系统的崩溃并恢复市场信心。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was an emergency initiative launched by the U.S. government during the 2008 financial crisis. Its primary goal was to stabilize the financial markets by purchasing or guaranteeing troubled assets (such as non-performing loans and mortgage-backed securities) held by financial institutions. Administered by the U.S. Treasury, the program was authorized to allocate up to $700 billion to prevent the collapse of the financial system and restore market confidence.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：  
  TARP主要应用于救助面临破产风险的银行、保险公司和汽车制造商等关键金融机构。通过注资或购买问题资产，TARP帮助这些机构恢复流动性，避免系统性风险。然而，该计划也引发了道德风险争议，即救助可能鼓励金融机构在未来承担过度风险。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  TARP was primarily used to rescue key financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, and automakers, that were at risk of bankruptcy. By injecting capital or purchasing troubled assets, TARP helped these institutions regain liquidity and avoid systemic risks. However, the program also sparked debates over moral hazard, as the bailouts might encourage financial institutions to take excessive risks in the future.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：  
  TARP在金融危机中起到了关键作用，防止了金融系统的全面崩溃，并为后续经济复苏奠定了基础。从监管角度看，TARP展示了政府在危机中的干预能力；从投资角度看，它恢复了市场信心；从行业角度看，它为金融机构提供了喘息空间。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  TARP played a critical role in preventing the complete collapse of the financial system during the crisis and laid the groundwork for subsequent economic recovery. From a regulatory perspective, TARP demonstrated the government's ability to intervene in crises. From an investment standpoint, it restored market confidence. From an industry perspective, it provided financial institutions with much-needed breathing room.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：  
  TARP起源于2008年金融危机，当时美国房地产市场崩盘导致大量抵押贷款违约，进而引发全球金融市场的动荡。2008年10月，美国国会通过了《紧急经济稳定法案》（Emergency Economic Stabilization Act），授权财政部实施TARP。时任财政部长亨利·保尔森（Henry Paulson）是该计划的主要推动者。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  TARP originated during the 2008 financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market, which led to widespread mortgage defaults and global financial turmoil. In October 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, authorizing the Treasury to implement TARP. Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was a key advocate for the program.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：  
  TARP的实施对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。它不仅稳定了美国金融系统，还间接支持了全球经济的复苏。截至2014年，TARP的大部分资金已被偿还，且政府从中获得了利润。然而，该计划也引发了公众对政府救助大型金融机构的广泛批评。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The implementation of TARP had a profound impact on global financial markets. It not only stabilized the U.S. financial system but also indirectly supported global economic recovery. By 2014, most of the TARP funds had been repaid, and the government even realized a profit. However, the program also faced widespread public criticism for bailing out large financial institutions.
