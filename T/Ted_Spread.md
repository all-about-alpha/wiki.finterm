# Ted Spread

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Ted Spread（泰德利差）是指3个月期美国国债利率与3个月期伦敦银行间同业拆借利率（LIBOR）之间的差额。这一指标反映了银行间市场的信用风险和市场流动性状况。当Ted Spread扩大时，通常意味着市场对银行体系的信用风险担忧增加，流动性趋紧；反之，则表明市场信心较强，流动性充裕。  
  **English Explanation**: The Ted Spread is the difference between the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill rate and the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This metric reflects the credit risk and liquidity conditions in the interbank market. A widening Ted Spread typically indicates increased concerns about credit risk in the banking system and tighter liquidity, while a narrowing spread suggests stronger market confidence and ample liquidity.

  **中文解释**：Ted Spread广泛应用于金融市场，尤其是在金融危机期间，投资者和监管机构通过观察Ted Spread的变化来评估银行体系的健康状况和市场流动性。例如，在2008年全球金融危机期间，Ted Spread大幅上升，反映出市场对银行违约风险的极度担忧。投资者在交易中也会参考Ted Spread，以判断市场情绪和风险偏好。
