# Two and Twenty

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “Two and Twenty” 是对冲基金行业中常见的一种收费模式，指的是基金管理人收取2%的固定管理费和20%的业绩提成。2%的管理费是基于基金资产规模计算的，而20%的业绩提成是基于基金的超额收益（即超过预设基准的收益部分）计算的。这种收费模式起源于对冲基金的早期发展阶段，旨在激励基金管理人为投资者创造更高的回报。  

  **English Explanation**  
  "Two and Twenty" is a common fee structure in the hedge fund industry, referring to a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. The 2% management fee is calculated based on the fund's assets under management (AUM), while the 20% performance fee is based on the fund's excess returns (i.e., returns above a predefined benchmark). This fee structure originated in the early days of hedge funds and is designed to incentivize fund managers to generate higher returns for investors.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  “Two and Twenty”收费模式广泛应用于对冲基金、私募股权基金和其他另类投资领域。投资者在选择此类基金时，需注意高额管理费和业绩提成可能对长期收益的影响，尤其是在基金表现不佳时，仍需支付固定管理费。此外，业绩提成的计算方式（如高水位线条款）也是投资者需要关注的重点。  

  **English Application**  
  The "Two and Twenty" fee structure is widely used in hedge funds, private equity funds, and other alternative investment vehicles. Investors should be aware that high management fees and performance fees can significantly impact long-term returns, especially when the fund underperforms, as the fixed management fee is still charged regardless of performance. Additionally, the calculation method for performance fees (e.g., high-water mark provisions) is a critical factor for investors to consider.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，“Two and Twenty”模式引发了对基金管理人激励机制和投资者利益保护的讨论。从投资角度看，这种模式能够激励基金管理人追求超额收益，但也可能导致过度冒险行为。从行业角度看，这一收费模式已成为对冲基金行业的标志性特征，但也面临来自低费率基金和被动投资的竞争压力。  

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the "Two and Twenty" model has sparked debates about fund manager incentives and investor protection. From an investment perspective, this model encourages fund managers to pursue excess returns but may also lead to excessive risk-taking. From an industry perspective, this fee structure has become a hallmark of the hedge fund industry but faces competition from low-fee funds and passive investment strategies.
