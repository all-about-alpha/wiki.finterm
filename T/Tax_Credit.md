# Tax Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  税收抵免（Tax Credit）是指纳税人根据税法规定，直接从应纳税额中扣除的金额。与税收减免不同，税收抵免是直接减少应纳税额，而非减少应税收入。税收抵免通常用于鼓励特定行为，如投资、教育、环保等。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A tax credit is an amount that taxpayers can subtract directly from the taxes they owe, as stipulated by tax laws. Unlike tax deductions, which reduce taxable income, tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax owed. Tax credits are often used to incentivize specific behaviors, such as investment, education, or environmental protection.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  税收抵免广泛应用于个人所得税、企业所得税等领域。例如，中国的个人所得税法规定，子女教育、继续教育、大病医疗等支出可以享受税收抵免。此外，企业投资于环保设备或研发活动也可能获得税收抵免。需要注意的是，税收抵免通常有上限或条件限制，纳税人需仔细核对是否符合条件。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Tax credits are widely applied in areas such as personal income tax and corporate income tax. For example, under China's personal income tax law, expenses for children's education, continuing education, and major medical treatments are eligible for tax credits. Additionally, companies investing in environmental protection equipment or R&D activities may also qualify for tax credits. It is important to note that tax credits often have caps or eligibility criteria, and taxpayers must carefully verify their qualifications.
