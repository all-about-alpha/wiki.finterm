# Tax Deed

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  税务契据（Tax Deed）是指政府因纳税人未按时缴纳房产税或其他相关税费，而通过法律程序将房产所有权转移给政府或第三方的一种法律文件。该文件通常由政府税务部门签发，用于确认新的所有权人。核心概念包括税务留置权（Tax Lien）和房产拍卖（Tax Sale）。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Tax Deed is a legal document issued by the government when a property owner fails to pay property taxes or related fees. It transfers ownership of the property to the government or a third party through a legal process. The document is typically issued by the tax authority and confirms the new ownership. Key concepts include Tax Lien and Tax Sale.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  税务契据通常用于房产税未缴纳的情况。政府会先对房产设置税务留置权，若纳税人长期未缴税，政府将通过拍卖等方式出售房产，以弥补未缴税款。投资者可通过参与税务拍卖购买房产，但需注意房产可能存在其他债务或法律纠纷。  
  **English Application**：  
  Tax Deeds are commonly used when property taxes remain unpaid. The government places a Tax Lien on the property, and if the taxes remain unpaid for an extended period, the property may be sold at a Tax Sale to recover the unpaid taxes. Investors can purchase properties through Tax Sales, but they should be aware of potential additional debts or legal issues associated with the property.
