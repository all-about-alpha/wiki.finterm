## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **中文起源**  
  有形个人财产的概念起源于古代财产分类体系。早在罗马法时期，财产就被分为“动产”和“不动产”，其中动产即现代有形个人财产的雏形。中世纪欧洲的商人阶层进一步推动了动产交易的发展，使其成为经济活动中不可或缺的一部分。

  The concept of tangible personal property dates back to ancient property classification systems. As early as Roman law, property was divided into "movable" and "immovable," with movable property being the precursor to modern tangible personal property. The merchant class in medieval Europe further advanced the trade of movable property, making it an essential part of economic activities.
