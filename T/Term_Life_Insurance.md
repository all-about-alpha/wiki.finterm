# Term Life Insurance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：定期寿险（Term Life Insurance）是一种人寿保险产品，投保人在约定的保险期限内（如10年、20年或至特定年龄）支付保费。若被保险人在保险期间内身故，保险公司将向受益人支付保险金。如果保险期满后被保险人仍然健在，保险合同终止，且不退还保费。定期寿险的核心特点是保费较低、保障期限明确，适合需要高额保障但预算有限的人群。  
  **English Explanation**: Term Life Insurance is a type of life insurance where the policyholder pays premiums for a specified term (e.g., 10, 20 years, or until a certain age). If the insured passes away during the term, the insurer pays a death benefit to the beneficiaries. If the insured outlives the term, the policy expires without any refund of premiums. The key features of term life insurance are its affordability and fixed coverage period, making it suitable for individuals seeking high coverage with limited budgets.
