# Tax Deferred

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  税延（Tax Deferred）是指纳税人可以将应缴纳的税款推迟到未来的某个时间点缴纳，而不是在收入产生时立即缴税。这一概念通常应用于退休账户、保险产品或其他投资工具中，允许资金在免税或低税环境下增长，直到提取时才需缴税。核心概念包括“延迟纳税”和“税收优惠”。  
  **English Explanation**:  
  Tax Deferred refers to the postponement of tax payments to a future date rather than paying them at the time income is earned. This concept is commonly applied to retirement accounts, insurance products, or other investment vehicles, allowing funds to grow in a tax-free or low-tax environment until they are withdrawn. Key concepts include "tax deferral" and "tax advantages."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  税延政策广泛应用于养老金计划（如中国的个人税收递延型商业养老保险）、教育储蓄账户以及某些投资产品中。通过税延，个人可以在收入较高时减少税负，同时在退休或资金提取时以较低的税率缴税。需要注意的是，税延并不意味着免税，未来提取时仍需缴税，且税率可能受政策变化影响。  
  **English Application**:  
  Tax deferral is widely used in pension plans (such as China's individual tax-deferred commercial pension insurance), education savings accounts, and certain investment products. By deferring taxes, individuals can reduce their tax burden during high-income years and pay taxes at potentially lower rates upon retirement or withdrawal. It is important to note that tax deferral does not mean tax exemption; taxes will still be due upon withdrawal, and rates may be subject to policy changes.
