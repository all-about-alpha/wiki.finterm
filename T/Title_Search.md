# Title Search

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：产权调查（Title Search）是指在房地产交易过程中，对房产的所有权历史、法律状态和相关权利进行详细调查的过程。其目的是确认卖方是否拥有合法的产权，并确保房产没有未解决的债务、抵押、法律纠纷或其他权利瑕疵。这一过程通常由专业的产权公司或律师完成，以确保交易的合法性和安全性。  
  **English Explanation**: A title search is the process of examining the historical ownership, legal status, and associated rights of a property during a real estate transaction. Its purpose is to confirm that the seller has legal ownership and to ensure the property is free from unresolved debts, liens, legal disputes, or other encumbrances. This process is typically conducted by a professional title company or attorney to ensure the legality and security of the transaction.

  **English Application**: Title searches are widely used in real estate purchases, mortgage loans, and title insurance. During a property purchase, buyers or lenders typically require a title search to avoid potential future disputes or financial losses. It is important to note that a title search does not eliminate all risks, which is why purchasing title insurance is a common supplementary measure.
