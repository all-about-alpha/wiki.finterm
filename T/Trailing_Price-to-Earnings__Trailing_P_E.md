## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    追踪市盈率（Trailing P/E）是一种衡量公司股票价格相对于其过去12个月每股收益（EPS）的估值指标。它通过将公司当前股价除以其过去12个月的每股收益来计算，反映了投资者愿意为每单位收益支付的价格。这一指标由金融分析师和投资者广泛使用，用于评估股票的相对价值。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Trailing Price-to-Earnings (Trailing P/E) ratio is a valuation metric that measures a company's current stock price relative to its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months. It is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the EPS of the last 12 months, indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings. This metric is widely used by financial analysts and investors to assess the relative value of a stock.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    追踪市盈率常用于股票估值分析，特别是在比较同行业公司的估值水平时。它可以帮助投资者判断股票是否被高估或低估。然而，需要注意的是，追踪市盈率基于历史数据，可能无法完全反映公司未来的盈利能力。此外，对于周期性行业或盈利波动较大的公司，追踪市盈率的参考价值可能有限。  
  - **English Application**  
    The Trailing P/E ratio is commonly used in stock valuation analysis, particularly when comparing valuation levels within the same industry. It helps investors determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. However, it is important to note that the Trailing P/E is based on historical data and may not fully reflect a company's future profitability. Additionally, for cyclical industries or companies with significant earnings volatility, the Trailing P/E may have limited reference value.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管、投资和行业角度来看，追踪市盈率是衡量公司估值的重要工具。它为投资者提供了一个直观的估值参考，有助于制定投资策略。同时，监管机构也关注市盈率水平，以评估市场是否存在过度投机行为。在行业分析中，追踪市盈率常用于横向比较，帮助识别行业内的价值洼地或高估领域。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Trailing P/E ratio is a crucial tool for assessing company valuation. It provides investors with an intuitive reference for valuation, aiding in the formulation of investment strategies.
