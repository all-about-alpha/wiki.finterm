# Tracking Stock

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  追踪股票（Tracking Stock）是一种特殊类型的股票，由母公司发行，用于追踪其旗下某一特定业务部门或子公司的财务表现。这种股票的价值与该业务部门的业绩直接挂钩，但并不代表对该业务部门的所有权。追踪股票的持有者通常不享有对母公司或该业务部门的投票权，但可以分享该业务部门的收益。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Tracking Stock is a special type of stock issued by a parent company to track the financial performance of a specific business unit or subsidiary. The value of this stock is directly tied to the performance of the business unit, but it does not represent ownership of the unit. Holders of tracking stock typically do not have voting rights in the parent company or the business unit but can share in the unit's profits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  追踪股票通常用于多元化企业，尤其是当某一业务部门的表现与母公司整体表现差异较大时。例如，科技公司可能会为其快速增长的云计算部门发行追踪股票，以吸引对该领域感兴趣的投资者。然而，投资者需注意，追踪股票的风险较高，因为其价值完全依赖于特定业务部门的业绩，且流动性可能较差。  
  **English Application**  
  Tracking stock is often used by diversified companies, especially when the performance of a specific business unit differs significantly from the parent company's overall performance. For example, a technology company might issue tracking stock for its fast-growing cloud computing division to attract investors interested in that sector. However, investors should be aware that tracking stock carries higher risks, as its value is entirely dependent on the performance of the specific business unit, and it may have lower liquidity.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，追踪股票的发行需要符合相关证券法规，确保信息披露透明。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更精细化的投资选择，使其能够专注于某一特定业务领域。从行业角度看，追踪股票有助于企业更好地进行资本配置，同时为市场提供更多元化的投资工具。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the issuance of tracking stock must comply with relevant securities laws to ensure transparency in disclosure. From an investment standpoint, it provides investors with more granular investment options, allowing them to focus on specific business areas. From an industry perspective, tracking stock helps companies better allocate capital while offering the market more diversified investment tools.
