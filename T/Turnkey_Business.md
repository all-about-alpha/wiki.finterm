  **English Application**: Turnkey businesses are widely used in real estate, manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure sectors. For example, developers deliver completed commercial complexes directly to investors, or factories deliver entire production lines to clients. It is crucial for clients to ensure clear contract terms to avoid disputes over responsibilities during later operations.
