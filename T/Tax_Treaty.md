## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：税收协定的起源可以追溯到19世纪末，当时国际贸易和投资活动逐渐增多，双重征税问题日益突出。1920年代，国际联盟（League of Nations）开始推动国际税收规则的制定，并于1928年发布了《关于避免双重征税的模型协定》。此后，经济合作与发展组织（OECD）和联合国（UN）分别制定了各自的税收协定范本，成为现代税收协定的基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of tax treaties can be traced back to the late 19th century, when international trade and investment activities began to increase, and the issue of double taxation became more prominent. In the 1920s, the League of Nations began promoting the development of international tax rules and released the Model Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation in 1928. Subsequently, the OECD and the United Nations developed their own model tax conventions, which form the basis of modern tax treaties.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：税收协定对全球经济和国际税收体系产生了深远影响。它不仅解决了双重征税问题，还促进了国际资本流动和贸易发展。目前，全球已有数千个双边税收协定，覆盖了大多数经济体。中国自1980年代起积极参与税收协定的谈判与签署，目前已与100多个国家和地区签订了税收协定。  
  **English Explanation**: Tax treaties have had a profound impact on the global economy and the international tax system. They have not only resolved the issue of double taxation but also facilitated international capital flows and trade development.
