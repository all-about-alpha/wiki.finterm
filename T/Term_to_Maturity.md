# Term to Maturity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：到期期限（Term to Maturity）是指从当前日期到金融工具（如债券、贷款或其他固定收益证券）到期日之间的时间长度。它是衡量金融工具剩余存续期的重要指标，通常以年、月或日为单位表示。到期期限直接影响金融工具的价格、收益率和风险水平。  
  **English Explanation**: Term to Maturity refers to the length of time remaining from the current date until the maturity date of a financial instrument (such as a bond, loan, or other fixed-income security). It is a key metric for measuring the remaining lifespan of a financial instrument, typically expressed in years, months, or days. The term to maturity directly impacts the price, yield, and risk level of the financial instrument.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：到期期限在投资决策中具有重要作用。例如，债券投资者会根据到期期限评估利率风险，因为长期债券对利率变化更为敏感。此外，银行在发放贷款时也会考虑贷款的到期期限，以管理流动性风险和信用风险。需要注意的是，到期期限较长的金融工具通常具有更高的价格波动性和不确定性。  
  **English Explanation**: Term to Maturity plays a critical role in investment decisions. For instance, bond investors assess interest rate risk based on the term to maturity, as longer-term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes. Additionally, banks consider the term to maturity when issuing loans to manage liquidity and credit risks. It is important to note that financial instruments with longer terms to maturity generally exhibit higher price volatility and uncertainty.
