## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  非关税壁垒的概念起源于20世纪中期的国际贸易实践。随着关税的逐步降低，各国开始采用其他手段保护本国经济。例如，1960年代日本通过严格的技术标准限制汽车进口，成为早期典型案例。  
  The concept of nontariff barriers originated in the mid-20th century during international trade practices. As tariffs gradually decreased, countries began adopting other measures to protect their economies. For example, in the 1960s, Japan restricted car imports through stringent technical standards, becoming an early classic case.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国加入WTO后，非关税壁垒的使用更加规范化和透明化。然而，近年来中美贸易摩擦中，技术标准和知识产权问题成为焦点，凸显了非关税壁垒的复杂性和争议性。在全球范围内，非关税壁垒已成为国际贸易谈判的重要议题之一。  
  After China joined the WTO, the use of nontariff barriers became more standardized and transparent. However, in recent U.S.-China trade disputes, issues such as technical standards and intellectual property have become focal points, highlighting the complexity and controversy of nontariff barriers. Globally, they have become a key topic in international trade negotiations.
