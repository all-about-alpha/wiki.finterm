# Nonperforming Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 不良资产（Nonperforming Asset）是指金融机构持有的、未能按时产生预期收益或无法收回本金的资产。这类资产通常包括逾期贷款、违约债券或其他无法正常履行合同义务的金融工具。不良资产的核心概念在于其“非正常”状态，即无法按照合同约定实现其经济价值。  
  **English Explanation**: A nonperforming asset refers to an asset held by a financial institution that fails to generate expected returns or recover principal on time. Such assets typically include overdue loans, defaulted bonds, or other financial instruments that cannot fulfill contractual obligations. The core concept lies in its "non-performing" status, meaning it cannot realize its economic value as per the contract.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 不良资产常见于银行、资产管理公司等金融机构。例如，当借款人长期拖欠贷款利息或本金时，该贷款会被列为不良资产。金融机构需通过重组、出售或核销等方式处理这些资产，以降低风险并改善资产负债表。需要注意的是，不良资产的积累可能引发系统性金融风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Nonperforming assets are commonly found in banks, asset management companies, and other financial institutions. For instance, when a borrower defaults on loan payments for an extended period, the loan is classified as a nonperforming asset. Financial institutions must address these assets through restructuring, sale, or write-offs to mitigate risks and improve their balance sheets. It is important to note that the accumulation of nonperforming assets can lead to systemic financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，不良资产率是衡量金融机构健康程度的重要指标；从投资角度看，高比例的不良资产可能预示企业或行业的财务困境；从行业角度看，有效管理不良资产有助于维护金融稳定和促进经济发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the nonperforming asset ratio is a key indicator of a financial institution's health; from an investment perspective, a high proportion of nonperforming assets may signal financial distress in a company or industry; from an industry perspective, effective management of nonperforming assets helps maintain financial stability and promote economic growth.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 不良资产的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的银行业危机时期。1929年大萧条期间，大量银行因贷款违约而倒闭，促使监管机构开始关注并定义“不良资产”。20世纪80年代美国储蓄与贷款危机进一步推动了这一概念的普及和应用。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of nonperforming assets dates back to the early 20th century during banking crises. The Great Depression of 1929 saw numerous bank failures due to loan defaults, prompting regulators to define "nonperforming assets." The Savings and Loan Crisis in the U.S. during the 1980s further popularized and applied this concept.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: 不良资产的积累曾多次引发全球性金融危机，如2008年次贷危机。目前，各国监管机构通过加强资本充足率要求和实施压力测试等措施来防范相关风险。中国也通过设立资产管理公司（如华融、信达）专门处理银行体系的不良资产。  
  **English Impact**: The accumulation of nonperforming assets has triggered global financial crises multiple times, such as the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. Currently, regulators worldwide mitigate related risks by strengthening capital adequacy requirements and implementing stress tests. China has also established asset management companies (e.g., Huarong, Cinda) specifically to handle nonperforming assets in the banking system.
