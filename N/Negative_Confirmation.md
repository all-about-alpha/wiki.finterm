# Negative Confirmation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：负面确认（Negative Confirmation）是一种审计或财务确认方法，通常由审计师或财务人员向客户或第三方发出，要求对方仅在发现信息存在错误或不一致时进行回复。如果未收到回复，则默认信息正确无误。这种方法常用于大规模账户余额或交易确认中，以提高效率。  
  **English Explanation**: Negative Confirmation is an auditing or financial confirmation method where auditors or financial professionals send requests to clients or third parties, asking them to respond only if they identify errors or discrepancies in the information. If no response is received, the information is assumed to be accurate. This method is often used for large-scale account balance or transaction confirmations to improve efficiency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：负面确认常用于银行对账单、应收账款审计等场景，特别是在客户数量庞大且交易金额较小的情况下。然而，这种方法存在一定风险，如未回复可能并非因为信息正确，而是因为客户忽略了请求或未能及时处理。因此，审计师需结合其他审计程序以确保准确性。  
  **English Application**: Negative Confirmations are commonly used in scenarios such as bank statement reconciliations and accounts receivable audits, especially when dealing with a large number of clients and small transaction amounts. However, this method carries risks, such as non-responses not necessarily indicating accuracy but rather oversight or delayed processing by clients. Therefore, auditors must combine it with other audit procedures to ensure accuracy.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：负面确认在提高审计效率方面具有重要意义，特别是在处理大规模数据时。然而，由于其依赖未回复作为默认正确的假设，监管机构和行业标准通常建议将其作为辅助手段而非主要审计方法。投资者和企业在使用时应谨慎评估其适用性。  
  **English Significance**: Negative Confirmations are significant for improving audit efficiency, especially when handling large-scale data. However, due to their reliance on non-responses as a default assumption of accuracy, regulatory bodies and industry standards often recommend using them as supplementary rather than primary audit methods. Investors and businesses should carefully assess their applicability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：负面确认的概念起源于20世纪中期，随着企业规模扩大和交易量增加，传统的一对一确认方法变得低效。为了应对这一挑战，审计行业开始采用负面确认作为一种替代方案。其首次正式应用可追溯至20世纪60年代的美国大型企业审计中。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of Negative Confirmation emerged in the mid-20th century as traditional one-to-one confirmation methods became inefficient with the expansion of business scales and transaction volumes. To address this challenge, the auditing industry adopted Negative Confirmations as an alternative approach. Its first formal application can be traced back to audits of large U.S. corporations in the 1960s.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：负面确认的引入显著提高了审计效率，特别是在处理大量小额交易时。然而，由于其潜在风险（如未回复不代表信息正确），许多国家和地区的监管机构对其使用进行了限制或规范。目前，负面确认仍被广泛使用，但通常与其他更可靠的审计方法结合使用。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of Negative Confirmations significantly improved audit efficiency, particularly when handling numerous small transactions. However, due to its inherent risks (e.g., non-responses not equating to accuracy), regulatory bodies in many countries have imposed restrictions or guidelines on its use. Currently, Negative Confirmations remain widely used but are typically combined with more reliable audit methods.
