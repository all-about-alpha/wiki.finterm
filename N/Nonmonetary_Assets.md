## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 非货币性资产的概念最早可追溯到古代贸易时期，当时人们以实物交换作为主要交易方式。随着现代会计制度的发展，20世纪初的会计准则开始明确区分货币性资产和非货币性资产。这一分类的提出旨在更准确地反映企业的财务状况和经营成果。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of nonmonetary assets dates back to ancient trade periods when barter was the primary mode of exchange. With the development of modern accounting systems, early 20th-century accounting standards began to clearly distinguish between monetary and nonmonetary assets.

  **English Impact**: The introduction of nonmonetary assets has had a profound impact on global accounting practices, particularly in areas such as cross-border mergers and asset valuation.
