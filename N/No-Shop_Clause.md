# No-Shop Clause

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “No-Shop Clause”（禁止招揽条款）是一种合同条款，通常出现在并购协议或投资协议中，规定目标公司在特定时间内不得主动或被动地与其他潜在买家或投资者进行谈判或接受其他报价。其核心目的是保护买方或投资者的利益，确保交易的排他性。  
  **English Explanation**: A "No-Shop Clause" is a contractual provision commonly found in merger and acquisition (M&A) or investment agreements, stipulating that the target company cannot actively or passively engage in negotiations with or accept offers from other potential buyers or investors during a specified period. Its primary purpose is to protect the interests of the buyer or investor by ensuring the exclusivity of the transaction.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 该条款常见于企业并购、私募股权投资等交易中。例如，在并购谈判期间，买方可能要求目标公司签署“No-Shop Clause”，以防止目标公司同时与其他潜在买家接触，从而降低交易不确定性。需要注意的是，该条款可能限制目标公司的灵活性，因此在谈判中需谨慎平衡双方利益。  
  **English Application**: This clause is frequently used in M&A transactions, private equity investments, and similar deals. For instance, during M&A negotiations, the buyer may require the target company to sign a "No-Shop Clause" to prevent the target from engaging with other potential buyers, thereby reducing transaction uncertainty. However, it may limit the target company's flexibility, so careful negotiation is needed to balance both parties' interests.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，“No-Shop Clause”有助于维护市场秩序，防止恶意竞争；从投资角度看，它为买方提供了交易确定性；从行业角度看，它促进了交易的顺利进行。然而，过度依赖该条款可能导致目标公司错失更好的交易机会。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the "No-Shop Clause" helps maintain market order and prevent malicious competition; from an investment perspective, it provides transaction certainty for buyers; from an industry perspective, it facilitates smooth deal execution. However, over-reliance on this clause may cause target companies to miss better opportunities.

  **English Origin**: The "No-Shop Clause" originated in the U.S. M&A market in the mid-to-late 20th century. As corporate mergers and acquisitions increased, buyers began introducing this clause to protect their interests.
