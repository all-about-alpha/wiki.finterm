# Negative Equity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **负资产** 是指资产的市场价值低于其相关负债的金额，通常用于描述房地产或贷款情况。当借款人拥有的房产价值低于其未偿还的抵押贷款余额时，就会出现负资产。  
  **Negative Equity** refers to a situation where the market value of an asset falls below the outstanding balance of the loan associated with it. It is commonly used to describe real estate or loan scenarios. Negative equity occurs when the value of a property owned by a borrower is less than the remaining mortgage balance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在房地产市场中，负资产通常出现在房价大幅下跌时，导致房主无法通过出售房产偿还贷款。这种情况可能增加违约风险，并对银行和金融机构造成损失。  
  In the real estate market, negative equity often arises when property prices drop significantly, leaving homeowners unable to repay their loans by selling the property. This situation can increase default risks and cause losses for banks and financial institutions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，负资产是衡量金融系统稳定性的重要指标之一。对投资者而言，负资产可能意味着投资回报的减少或亏损。对行业来说，负资产的增加可能引发市场信心下降和经济衰退的风险。  
  From a regulatory perspective, negative equity is an important indicator of financial system stability. For investors, it may signify reduced returns or losses. For the industry, an increase in negative equity can lead to declining market confidence and risks of economic recession.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  负资产的概念最早在20世纪80年代的美国房地产危机中被广泛关注。当时由于经济衰退和利率上升，许多房主陷入负资产困境。2008年全球金融危机期间，负资产问题再次成为焦点，尤其是在次贷危机中大量房产价值暴跌。  
  The concept of negative equity gained widespread attention during the U.S. real estate crisis in the 1980s, when economic recession and rising interest rates left many homeowners in negative equity. During the 2008 global financial crisis, negative equity became a focal point again, particularly as property values plummeted in the subprime mortgage crisis.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，2008年金融危机后部分城市的房地产市场也出现了负资产现象，但整体影响相对有限。目前，中国房地产市场仍以稳定为主流趋势。在全球范围内，负资产问题在房价波动较大的国家（如美国、英国）更为常见，并对金融系统和经济增长产生深远影响。  
  In China, negative equity emerged in some cities after the 2008 financial crisis but had relatively limited overall impact. Currently, stability remains the dominant trend in China's real estate market. Globally, negative equity is more common in countries with significant property price fluctuations (e.g., U.S., U.K.) and has profound effects on financial systems and economic growth.
