# Non-Recourse Finance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非追索权融资（Non-Recourse Finance）是一种贷款形式，贷款人仅能依靠特定资产或项目的现金流和抵押物来偿还贷款。如果借款人违约，贷款人无权追索借款人的其他资产或收入，只能通过处置抵押物来弥补损失。这种融资方式常见于大型项目融资，如基础设施、能源或房地产项目。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-recourse finance is a type of loan where the lender can only rely on the cash flow and collateral of a specific asset or project for repayment. If the borrower defaults, the lender has no right to pursue the borrower's other assets or income and can only recover losses by liquidating the collateral. This financing method is commonly used in large-scale project financing, such as infrastructure, energy, or real estate projects.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：非追索权融资广泛应用于高风险、高投资回报的项目，如可再生能源项目（如风电场、太阳能电站）、大型基础设施（如高速公路、桥梁）以及房地产开发。由于贷款人仅依赖项目本身的现金流和资产，借款人的其他资产不受影响，但贷款人通常会对项目进行严格的尽职调查和风险评估。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-recourse finance is widely used in high-risk, high-return projects, such as renewable energy projects (e.g., wind farms, solar power plants), large-scale infrastructure (e.g., highways, bridges), and real estate development. Since lenders rely solely on the project's cash flow and assets, the borrower's other assets remain unaffected. However, lenders typically conduct rigorous due diligence and risk assessments on the project.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：非追索权融资在金融领域具有重要意义，特别是在项目融资中。它为高风险项目提供了资金支持，同时保护了借款人的其他资产。从监管角度看，这种融资方式有助于分散风险，促进大型项目的实施。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了参与高回报项目的机会，但需承担较高的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-recourse finance holds significant importance in the financial sector, particularly in project financing. It provides funding for high-risk projects while protecting the borrower's other assets. From a regulatory perspective, this financing method helps distribute risk and facilitates the implementation of large-scale projects. From an investment perspective, it offers investors opportunities to participate in high-return projects, albeit with higher risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：非追索权融资的起源可以追溯到20世纪中叶，随着大型基础设施和能源项目的兴起，传统的融资方式无法满足需求。20世纪70年代，石油危机和能源需求的增长推动了这种融资方式的发展。美国和其他发达国家率先采用非追索权融资，用于开发石油、天然气和电力项目。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of non-recourse finance can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when traditional financing methods could not meet the demands of large-scale infrastructure and energy projects. In the 1970s, the oil crisis and growing energy needs spurred the development of this financing method. The United States and other developed countries were among the first to adopt non-recourse finance for oil, natural gas, and power projects.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：非追索权融资对全球项目融资市场产生了深远影响。它促进了大型项目的实施，特别是在新兴市场和发展中国家。如今，这种融资方式已成为可再生能源和基础设施项目的关键资金来源。然而，由于其高风险特性，贷款人通常要求更高的利率和更严格的担保条件。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-recourse finance has had a profound impact on the global project financing market. It has facilitated the implementation of large-scale projects, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries. Today, this financing method has become a critical source of funding for renewable energy and infrastructure projects. However, due to its high-risk nature, lenders typically demand higher interest rates and stricter collateral requirements.
