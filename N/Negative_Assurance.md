## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：负面保证（Negative Assurance）是一种审计或鉴证服务，由注册会计师或其他专业人士提供，表明在审查过程中未发现任何重大错误或遗漏。这种保证并不提供正面确认，而是基于有限的程序得出结论，通常用于中期财务报表或其他非全面审计的场合。  
  **English Explanation**: Negative Assurance is a type of audit or attestation service provided by certified public accountants or other professionals, indicating that no material misstatements or omissions were found during the review process.
