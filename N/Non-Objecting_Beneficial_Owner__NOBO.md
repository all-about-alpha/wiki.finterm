    A Non-Objecting Beneficial Owner (NOBO) refers to a beneficial owner of securities who does not object to the disclosure of their personal information to the issuing company or other relevant parties.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    NOBO概念起源于20世纪80年代的美国证券市场。当时，随着机构投资者和个人投资者数量的增加，公司难以直接联系实际持股人。为了解决这一问题，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）引入了NOBO机制，允许公司通过中介机构获取不反对披露信息的股东名单。这一机制随后被全球多个资本市场采纳。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of NOBO originated in the U.S. securities market in the 1980s. At that time, with the increasing number of institutional and individual investors, companies found it difficult to directly contact the actual shareholders. To address this issue, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced the NOBO mechanism, allowing companies to obtain lists of shareholders who did not object to the disclosure of their information through intermediaries. This mechanism was subsequently adopted by multiple global capital markets.
