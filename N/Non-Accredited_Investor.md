## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  非合格投资者的概念起源于20世纪30年代的美国大萧条时期。当时，美国政府为了恢复市场信心和保护普通投资者，通过《1933年证券法》和《1934年证券交易法》设立了合格投资者的标准。这一标准后来被全球多个国家和地区借鉴和采用。  
  The concept of non-accredited investors originated during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. To restore market confidence and protect ordinary investors, the U.S. government established accreditation standards through the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These standards were later adopted by many countries and regions worldwide.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，随着资本市场的快速发展，非合格投资者的分类逐渐成为监管机构保护中小投资者的重要工具。目前，中国证监会（CSRC）通过一系列法规和政策，确保非合格投资者在相对安全的投资环境中进行资产配置。  
  In China, with the rapid development of the capital market, the classification of non-accredited investors has gradually become an important tool for regulators to protect small and medium-sized investors. Currently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) ensures that non-accredited investors allocate assets in a relatively safe investment environment through a series of regulations and policies.
