# Nominal Rate of Return

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：名义回报率是指投资在未考虑通货膨胀因素情况下的回报率。它反映了投资在名义上的收益水平，但不反映实际购买力的变化。核心概念包括名义收益、未调整的回报率以及货币的时间价值。  
  **English Explanation**: The nominal rate of return refers to the return on an investment without adjusting for inflation. It reflects the nominal earnings of an investment but does not account for changes in purchasing power. Key concepts include nominal earnings, unadjusted returns, and the time value of money.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：名义回报率常用于评估金融产品的表面收益，如债券、股票或储蓄账户。然而，投资者需注意，高名义回报率并不一定意味着高实际回报率，因为通货膨胀可能侵蚀购买力。在比较不同投资时，应结合实际回报率进行综合考量。  
  **English Explanation**: The nominal rate of return is often used to evaluate the surface-level earnings of financial products such as bonds, stocks, or savings accounts. However, investors should note that a high nominal rate does not necessarily translate to a high real rate of return, as inflation can erode purchasing power. When comparing investments, it is essential to consider the real rate of return.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，名义回报率是衡量投资表现的重要指标之一。它为投资者提供了初步的收益参考，但需结合通货膨胀率和税收等因素进行更全面的分析。在制定投资策略时，理解名义与实际回报率的区别至关重要。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the nominal rate of return is a key metric for assessing investment performance. It provides investors with a preliminary reference for earnings but requires comprehensive analysis when combined with factors like inflation and taxes. Understanding the difference between nominal and real rates is critical in formulating investment strategies.
