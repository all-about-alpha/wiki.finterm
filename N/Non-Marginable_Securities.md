# Non-Marginable Securities

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非保证金证券（Non-Marginable Securities）是指不能用于保证金交易的证券。根据美国联邦储备委员会的 Regulation T 规定，某些证券由于其高风险或低流动性，不允许投资者通过借入资金（即使用保证金）进行购买。这类证券通常包括低价股、场外交易股票、新发行的股票等。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-Marginable Securities refer to securities that cannot be used for margin trading. According to the Federal Reserve's Regulation T, certain securities, due to their high risk or low liquidity, are not allowed to be purchased using borrowed funds (i.e., margin). These securities typically include penny stocks, over-the-counter stocks, newly issued stocks, etc.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：非保证金证券通常出现在高风险投资领域，如低价股或未上市公司的股票。投资者在交易这些证券时需全额支付购买金额，无法通过杠杆放大收益或风险。此类证券适合风险承受能力较高的投资者，但需注意其价格波动大、流动性差的特点。  
  **English Application**: Non-Marginable Securities are often found in high-risk investment areas such as penny stocks or shares of unlisted companies. Investors must pay the full purchase amount when trading these securities and cannot use leverage to amplify returns or risks. These securities are suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance but require attention to their high price volatility and low liquidity.
