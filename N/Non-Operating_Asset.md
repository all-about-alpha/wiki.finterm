# Non-Operating Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 非经营性资产是指企业持有的、不直接参与日常经营活动的资产。这类资产通常包括投资性房地产、长期股权投资、闲置设备等。它们不直接产生主营业务收入，但可能通过增值或投资收益为企业带来额外利润。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-operating assets are assets held by a company that are not directly involved in its core business operations. These assets typically include investment properties, long-term equity investments, idle equipment, etc. They do not directly generate primary business revenue but may provide additional profits through appreciation or investment returns.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 非经营性资产常见于多元化经营的企业或拥有大量闲置资源的企业。例如，房地产公司可能持有投资性物业作为非经营性资产，以获取租金收入或资本增值。需要注意的是，过度依赖非经营性资产可能导致企业核心业务竞争力下降，且其价值波动可能带来财务风险。  
  **English Application**: Non-operating assets are often found in diversified companies or those with significant idle resources. For example, a real estate company may hold investment properties as non-operating assets to earn rental income or capital appreciation. It is important to note that over-reliance on non-operating assets may weaken the competitiveness of the core business, and their value fluctuations can pose financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，非经营性资产的披露有助于投资者全面了解企业的财务状况和风险分布。从投资角度看，这类资产的增值潜力可能为企业带来额外收益，但也需关注其流动性风险。从行业角度看，合理配置非经营性资产有助于优化企业资源结构，提升整体运营效率。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the disclosure of non-operating assets helps investors fully understand a company's financial condition and risk distribution. From an investment perspective, the appreciation potential of these assets may bring additional profits but also requires attention to liquidity risks. From an industry perspective, rational allocation of non-operating assets can optimize resource structure and enhance overall operational efficiency.
