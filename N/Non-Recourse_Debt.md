# Non-Recourse Debt

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 无追索权债务（Non-Recourse Debt）是一种贷款形式，借款人仅以特定资产作为抵押，若借款人违约，债权人只能通过处置该抵押资产来偿还债务，而无法追索借款人的其他资产或个人财产。这种债务常见于房地产和大型项目融资中。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-recourse debt is a type of loan where the borrower pledges a specific asset as collateral. If the borrower defaults, the lender can only recover the debt by seizing and selling the collateral, and cannot pursue the borrower’s other assets or personal property. This type of debt is commonly used in real estate and large project financing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 无追索权债务广泛应用于房地产投资、基础设施建设和能源项目等领域。例如，开发商可能以某处房产作为抵押获得贷款，若项目失败，银行只能收回该房产，而不能要求开发商用其他资产偿还。风险在于，若抵押资产价值不足以覆盖债务，债权人将承担损失。  
  **English Application**: Non-recourse debt is widely used in real estate investments, infrastructure development, and energy projects. For example, a developer might secure a loan using a specific property as collateral. If the project fails, the bank can only reclaim that property and cannot demand repayment from the developer’s other assets. The risk lies in the possibility that the collateral’s value may not cover the debt, leaving the lender with a loss.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，无追索权债务有助于分散风险，保护借款人的其他资产；从投资角度看，它为高风险项目提供了融资渠道；从行业角度看，它推动了大型项目的实施和经济发展。然而，债权人也需谨慎评估抵押资产的价值和流动性。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, non-recourse debt helps distribute risk and protects borrowers’ other assets. From an investment standpoint, it provides financing for high-risk projects. From an industry perspective, it facilitates large-scale projects and economic development. However, lenders must carefully assess the value and liquidity of collateral.
