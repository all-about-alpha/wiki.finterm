## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Next-In, First-Out (NIFO) 是一种库存管理方法，指的是最新进入库存的货物最先被使用或销售。这种方法与传统的“先进先出”（FIFO）和“后进先出”（LIFO）不同，强调优先处理最新入库的货物。  
  **English Explanation**: Next-In, First-Out (NIFO) is an inventory management method where the most recently received items are the first to be used or sold.
