# Naked Shorting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **裸卖空** 是指投资者在没有实际借入股票或确保能够借入股票的情况下，直接在市场上卖出股票的行为。这种行为通常发生在投资者预期股价会下跌时，希望通过低价买回股票以获利。裸卖空的核心概念在于“无担保卖空”，即卖空者并未持有或借入所卖出的股票。  
  **Naked shorting** refers to the practice of selling shares in the market without actually borrowing them or ensuring their availability. This typically occurs when investors anticipate a decline in stock prices, aiming to buy back the shares at a lower price for profit. The core concept of naked shorting is "uncovered short selling," meaning the seller does not hold or borrow the shares being sold.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，裸卖空被严格监管，因其可能导致市场操纵和股价剧烈波动。投资者在进行卖空操作时，必须确保已借入股票或具备借入能力，否则将面临法律风险。裸卖空的滥用可能引发市场恐慌和系统性风险。  
  In China, naked shorting is strictly regulated due to its potential to cause market manipulation and severe price fluctuations. Investors engaging in short selling must ensure they have borrowed the shares or have the ability to do so; otherwise, they face legal risks. The misuse of naked shorting can trigger market panic and systemic risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，禁止裸卖空有助于维护市场秩序和投资者信心；从投资角度看，合法合规的卖空行为有助于价格发现和市场效率；从行业角度看，严格的监管措施有助于防范金融风险。  
  From a regulatory perspective, banning naked shorting helps maintain market order and investor confidence; from an investment perspective, legal and compliant short selling aids price discovery and market efficiency; from an industry perspective, strict regulatory measures help prevent financial risks.
