# Net Realizable Value (NRV)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：净变现价值（Net Realizable Value, NRV）是指企业在正常经营过程中，通过销售资产或清偿负债所能获得的现金或现金等价物的金额，减去预计的销售费用和相关税费后的净值。这一概念主要用于存货和应收账款的估值，确保资产在财务报表中反映其实际可回收价值。  
  **English Explanation**: Net Realizable Value (NRV) refers to the estimated amount of cash or cash equivalents that a company expects to receive from the sale of an asset or settlement of a liability in the ordinary course of business, minus any anticipated selling costs and related taxes. This concept is primarily used for valuing inventory and accounts receivable, ensuring that assets are reflected at their actual recoverable value in financial statements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：净变现价值广泛应用于存货和应收账款的会计处理中。例如，在存货减值测试中，企业需比较存货的成本与其净变现价值，若成本高于NRV，则需计提减值准备。此外，NRV也用于评估应收账款的可回收性，帮助企业识别潜在的坏账风险。  
  **English Application**: NRV is widely applied in the accounting treatment of inventory and accounts receivable. For instance, in inventory impairment testing, companies compare the cost of inventory with its NRV; if the cost exceeds NRV, an impairment loss must be recognized. Additionally, NRV is used to assess the recoverability of accounts receivable, helping businesses identify potential bad debt risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：净变现价值在财务报告和风险管理中具有重要意义。它确保资产以真实可回收的价值列示，避免高估资产价值导致的财务失真。从监管角度看，NRV的应用符合会计准则的谨慎性原则；从投资角度看，它有助于投资者更准确地评估企业的财务状况；从行业角度看，它提升了财务信息的透明度和可比性。  
  **English Significance**: NRV plays a crucial role in financial reporting and risk management. It ensures that assets are presented at their true recoverable value, preventing financial misrepresentation due to overvaluation. From a regulatory perspective, the use of NRV aligns with the prudence principle in accounting standards; from an investment perspective, it helps investors more accurately assess a company's financial health; from an industry perspective, it enhances the transparency and comparability of financial information.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：净变现价值的概念起源于20世纪初的会计实践，随着企业规模的扩大和财务报告的复杂化，如何准确反映资产的实际价值成为重要议题。1929年大萧条后，会计界开始强调谨慎性原则，NRV作为这一原则的具体应用逐渐被纳入会计准则。国际会计准则委员会（IASB）和美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）在其准则中均对NRV进行了详细规定。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of Net Realizable Value originated in early 20th-century accounting practices. As businesses grew larger and financial reporting became more complex, accurately reflecting the actual value of assets became a critical issue. After the Great Depression of 1929, the accounting profession began emphasizing the prudence principle, and NRV gradually became incorporated into accounting standards as a specific application of this principle. Both the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have detailed provisions for NRV in their standards.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：净变现价值的引入对全球会计实践产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了财务报表的准确性，还增强了投资者对企业财务状况的信心。在中国，《企业会计准则》明确要求企业在存货和应收账款的计量中采用NRV原则，这有助于与国际会计准则接轨并提升中国企业的国际竞争力。目前，NRV已成为全球范围内广泛接受的会计估值方法之一。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of Net Realizable Value has had a profound impact on global accounting practices. It has not only improved the accuracy of financial statements but also enhanced investor confidence in companies' financial health. In China, the "Enterprise Accounting Standards" explicitly require companies to apply the NRV principle in measuring inventory and accounts receivable, facilitating alignment with international accounting standards and enhancing Chinese enterprises' global competitiveness. Today, NRV is one of the widely accepted valuation methods globally.
