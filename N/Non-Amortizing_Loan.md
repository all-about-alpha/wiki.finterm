# Non-Amortizing Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 非摊销贷款是一种贷款类型，借款人在贷款期限内只需支付利息，而无需偿还本金。贷款到期时，借款人需一次性偿还全部本金。这种贷款常见于短期融资或特定项目融资中。  
  **English Explanation**: A non-amortizing loan is a type of loan where the borrower only pays interest during the loan term and does not repay the principal. At the end of the loan term, the borrower must repay the entire principal in one lump sum. This type of loan is commonly used in short-term financing or specific project financing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 非摊销贷款常用于企业短期资金周转、房地产开发项目或特定投资项目中。由于借款人只需支付利息，短期内现金流压力较小，但到期时需一次性偿还大额本金，存在较高的流动性风险。  
  **English Application**: Non-amortizing loans are often used for short-term corporate cash flow needs, real estate development projects, or specific investment projects. Since borrowers only need to pay interest, they face less short-term cash flow pressure. However, they must repay a large principal amount at maturity, posing significant liquidity risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，非摊销贷款的风险较高，需严格监控借款人的还款能力。从投资角度看，这类贷款可能提供较高的回报率，但也伴随更高的违约风险。在行业中，非摊销贷款为特定项目提供了灵活的融资方式。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, non-amortizing loans carry higher risks and require strict monitoring of borrowers' repayment capabilities. From an investment perspective, these loans may offer higher returns but also come with increased default risks. In the industry, non-amortizing loans provide flexible financing options for specific projects.
