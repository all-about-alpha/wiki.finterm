## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：准货币（Near Money）是指那些虽然不是现金或活期存款，但可以迅速转换为现金或用于支付的金融资产。这类资产具有高流动性和低风险的特点，通常包括定期存款、国库券、货币市场基金等。准货币的概念由经济学家提出，用于描述那些在流动性上接近货币但又不完全等同于货币的资产。  
  **English Explanation**: Near Money refers to financial assets that are not cash or demand deposits but can be quickly converted into cash or used for payments.
