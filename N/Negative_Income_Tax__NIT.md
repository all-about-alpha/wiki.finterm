# Negative Income Tax (NIT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **负所得税（Negative Income Tax, NIT）** 是一种社会保障政策，旨在通过税收系统向低收入者提供直接的经济补贴。其核心概念是当个人或家庭的收入低于某一阈值时，政府不仅不征收所得税，反而向其支付一定比例的补贴，以帮助他们达到基本生活水平。这一概念最早由经济学家米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）在20世纪60年代提出。  
  **Negative Income Tax (NIT)** is a social welfare policy designed to provide direct economic subsidies to low-income individuals through the tax system. The core concept is that when an individual or family's income falls below a certain threshold, the government not only exempts them from income tax but also pays them a proportional subsidy to help them achieve a basic standard of living. This concept was first proposed by economist Milton Friedman in the 1960s.

* **应用 / Application**  
  负所得税通常应用于社会保障体系较为完善的国家或地区，用于替代或补充传统的福利计划。例如，美国曾在上世纪70年代进行过负所得税的试点项目。其风险在于可能增加政府财政负担，并可能引发“福利依赖”现象，即部分人因依赖补贴而减少工作积极性。  
  Negative Income Tax is typically applied in countries or regions with well-established social security systems, serving as an alternative or supplement to traditional welfare programs. For example, the United States conducted pilot projects on NIT in the 1970s. The risks include potential increases in government fiscal burdens and the possibility of "welfare dependency," where some individuals may reduce their work motivation due to reliance on subsidies.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度来看，负所得税有助于简化福利分配流程，提高资金使用效率；从投资和行业角度来看，它能够刺激消费需求，促进经济增长；从社会公平角度来看，它有助于缩小贫富差距，提升低收入群体的生活质量。  
  From a regulatory perspective, Negative Income Tax helps simplify welfare distribution processes and improve fund utilization efficiency; from an investment and industry perspective, it can stimulate consumer demand and promote economic growth; from a social equity perspective, it helps narrow the wealth gap and improve the quality of life for low-income groups.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  负所得税的概念最早由美国经济学家米尔顿·弗里德曼在其1962年出版的《资本主义与自由》（Capitalism and Freedom）一书中提出。他主张通过税收系统直接向低收入者提供补贴，以取代复杂的福利计划。这一理念在20世纪70年代被美国政府采纳并进行了试点实验。  
  The concept of Negative Income Tax was first proposed by American economist Milton Friedman in his 1962 book *Capitalism and Freedom*. He advocated for providing direct subsidies to low-income individuals through the tax system as a replacement for complex welfare programs. This idea was adopted by the U.S. government in the 1970s and tested through pilot experiments.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  负所得税的提出对全球社会保障政策产生了深远影响。尽管其实施范围有限，但其核心理念为许多国家的福利改革提供了参考。例如，加拿大的“保证基本收入”计划和芬兰的“全民基本收入”实验都受到了负所得税思想的启发。目前，负所得税仍被视为一种潜在的社会保障工具，但其大规模实施仍需克服财政和政策上的挑战。  
  The proposal of Negative Income Tax has had a profound impact on global social security policies. Although its implementation has been limited, its core ideas have provided references for welfare reforms in many countries. For example, Canada's "Guaranteed Basic Income" program and Finland's "Universal Basic Income" experiment were inspired by NIT principles. Currently, NIT is still regarded as a potential social security tool, but its large-scale implementation requires overcoming fiscal and policy challenges.
