# Naked Call

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：裸卖空看涨期权（Naked Call）是指期权卖方在未持有标的资产的情况下，直接卖出看涨期权的行为。由于卖方没有标的资产作为对冲，若标的资产价格上涨，卖方将面临无限亏损的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: A naked call refers to the act of selling a call option without owning the underlying asset. Since the seller does not hold the asset as a hedge, they face potentially unlimited losses if the price of the underlying asset rises.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：裸卖空看涨期权通常被投机者用于预期标的资产价格不会上涨或会下跌的市场环境中。然而，这种策略风险极高，因为一旦市场走势与预期相反，卖方可能面临巨额亏损。投资者在使用此策略时需谨慎评估市场风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Naked calls are often used by speculators in market environments where they expect the underlying asset's price to remain stable or decline. However, this strategy carries significant risk, as unexpected price increases can lead to substantial losses. Investors must carefully assess market risks when employing this strategy.
