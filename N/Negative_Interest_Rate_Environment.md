# Negative Interest Rate Environment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **负利率环境** 是指中央银行将基准利率设定为负值，导致商业银行在央行存款时需支付利息，而非获得利息。这一政策旨在刺激经济，鼓励借贷和投资，抑制储蓄。  
  A **Negative Interest Rate Environment** refers to a situation where the central bank sets its benchmark interest rate below zero, causing commercial banks to pay interest on deposits held at the central bank rather than earning it. This policy aims to stimulate the economy by encouraging borrowing and investment while discouraging savings.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在负利率环境下，企业和个人更倾向于借贷和消费，而非储蓄。银行可能将成本转嫁给客户，导致存款利率下降甚至为负。然而，长期负利率可能削弱银行盈利能力，增加金融系统风险。  
  In a negative interest rate environment, businesses and individuals are more inclined to borrow and spend rather than save. Banks may pass on the costs to customers, leading to lower or even negative deposit rates. However, prolonged negative rates can weaken bank profitability and increase financial system risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  负利率环境是央行应对经济衰退或通缩的非常规货币政策工具。它对金融市场、银行业和投资者行为产生深远影响，但也引发了对资产泡沫和金融稳定性的担忧。  
  A negative interest rate environment is an unconventional monetary policy tool used by central banks to combat economic recession or deflation. It has profound effects on financial markets, banking sectors, and investor behavior but also raises concerns about asset bubbles and financial stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  负利率政策最早由瑞典央行于2009年实施，以应对全球金融危机后的经济低迷。随后，欧洲央行（2014年）和日本央行（2016年）也相继采用这一政策。中国尚未正式实施负利率，但对其进行了深入研究。  
  The negative interest rate policy was first implemented by Sweden’s central bank in 2009 in response to economic stagnation following the global financial crisis. Later, the European Central Bank (2014) and the Bank of Japan (2016) adopted similar policies. China has not officially implemented negative rates but has conducted in-depth research on them.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  负利率政策在全球范围内对银行业、债券市场和房地产市场产生了显著影响。例如，欧洲和日本的银行利润受到挤压，而债券收益率普遍下降。中国虽未实施负利率，但其货币政策调整也受到全球低利率环境的影响。  
  Negative interest rate policies have significantly impacted banking sectors, bond markets, and real estate markets globally. For example, banks in Europe and Japan have seen squeezed profits, while bond yields have generally declined. Although China has not adopted negative rates, its monetary policy adjustments are influenced by the global low-interest-rate environment.
