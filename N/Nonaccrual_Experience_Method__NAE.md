# Nonaccrual Experience Method (NAE)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  非应计经验法（Nonaccrual Experience Method, NAE）是一种会计方法，用于估计和确认贷款或应收账款中可能无法收回的部分。该方法基于历史经验和统计模型，预测未来可能发生的坏账损失，并将其提前计入财务报表中。NAE的核心概念是通过历史数据推断未来的信用风险，从而更准确地反映企业的财务状况。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The Nonaccrual Experience Method (NAE) is an accounting approach used to estimate and recognize the portion of loans or receivables that may become uncollectible. This method relies on historical experience and statistical models to predict future bad debt losses and incorporates them into financial statements in advance. The core concept of NAE is to infer future credit risks based on historical data, thereby providing a more accurate reflection of a company's financial condition.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  NAE主要应用于金融机构和企业的应收账款管理。例如，银行在发放贷款后，会根据借款人的历史还款记录和经济环境的变化，使用NAE方法估算可能的坏账损失。此外，企业在赊销商品或服务时，也会采用NAE来评估客户的信用风险。需要注意的是，NAE的准确性高度依赖于历史数据的质量和模型的合理性，因此在应用时需谨慎评估数据来源和模型假设。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  NAE is primarily used in financial institutions and corporate accounts receivable management. For example, after issuing loans, banks use the NAE method to estimate potential bad debt losses based on borrowers' historical repayment records and changes in the economic environment. Additionally, companies use NAE to assess customer credit risks when selling goods or services on credit. It is important to note that the accuracy of NAE heavily depends on the quality of historical data and the rationality of the model, so careful evaluation of data sources and model assumptions is required during application.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度来看，NAE有助于金融机构更准确地计提坏账准备，从而满足监管要求并降低系统性风险。从投资角度来看，NAE提高了财务报表的透明度，使投资者能够更好地评估企业的财务健康状况。从行业角度来看，NAE的应用推动了信用风险管理技术的进步，提升了行业的整体风险管理水平。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, NAE helps financial institutions more accurately provision for bad debts, thereby meeting regulatory requirements and reducing systemic risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  非应计经验法的起源可以追溯到20世纪中后期，随着金融市场的复杂化和信用风险的增加，传统的坏账计提方法逐渐暴露出不足。20世纪80年代，美国银行业率先引入NAE方法，以应对贷款违约率上升的问题。该方法通过分析历史违约数据，建立统计模型，从而更科学地预测未来的坏账损失。此后，NAE逐渐被全球金融机构和企业广泛采用。  
  **English Origin**  
  The Nonaccrual Experience Method originated in the mid-to-late 20th century as financial markets became more complex and credit risks increased, exposing the limitations of traditional bad debt provisioning methods. In the 1980s, the U.S. banking industry pioneered the NAE method to address rising loan default rates. By analyzing historical default data and building statistical models, NAE provided a more scientific approach to predicting future bad debt losses. Since then, NAE has been widely adopted by financial institutions and corporations globally.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  NAE的引入显著提升了金融机构的风险管理能力，使其能够更早地识别和应对潜在的信用风险。此外，NAE的应用也推动了会计标准的完善，例如国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和美国通用会计准则（GAAP）均对坏账准备的计提方法提出了更严格的要求。目前，NAE已成为全球金融行业信用风险管理的重要工具之一。  
  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of NAE significantly enhanced the risk management capabilities of financial institutions, enabling them to identify and address potential credit risks earlier. Additionally, the application of NAE has driven improvements in accounting standards, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which have imposed stricter requirements on bad debt provisioning methods. Today, NAE is one of the essential tools for credit risk management in the global financial industry.
