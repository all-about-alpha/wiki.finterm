  不可取消保险单的概念起源于20世纪初的美国，当时保险市场缺乏规范，保险公司常因投保人健康状况变化或经济环境波动而取消保单。为保护消费者权益，美国各州陆续出台法规，要求保险公司提供不可取消或保证续保的保险产品。这一概念逐渐被全球保险市场采纳。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of noncancellable insurance policies originated in the early 20th century in the United States, when the insurance market lacked regulation, and insurers often canceled policies due to changes in policyholders' health or economic conditions. To protect consumer rights, U.S. states gradually introduced regulations requiring insurers to offer noncancellable or guaranteed renewable insurance products. This concept was later adopted by global insurance markets.
