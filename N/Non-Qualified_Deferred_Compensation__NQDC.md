# Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非合格递延补偿（NQDC）是一种雇主提供的补偿计划，允许员工将部分收入递延至未来某个时间点领取。与合格计划（如401(k)）不同，NQDC不受《雇员退休收入保障法》（ERISA）的严格监管，因此具有更大的灵活性。核心概念包括递延收入、税收延迟和雇主承诺。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC) is an employer-provided compensation plan that allows employees to defer a portion of their income to be received at a future date. Unlike qualified plans (e.g., 401(k)), NQDC is not strictly regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), offering greater flexibility. Key concepts include deferred income, tax deferral, and employer commitment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：NQDC通常适用于高收入员工或高管，作为吸引和保留人才的工具。常见应用场景包括奖金递延、股权激励和退休规划。需要注意的是，NQDC存在信用风险，即如果雇主破产，员工可能无法获得承诺的补偿。  
  **English Application**: NQDC is typically used for high-income employees or executives as a tool to attract and retain talent. Common applications include bonus deferrals, equity incentives, and retirement planning. It’s important to note that NQDC carries credit risk, meaning employees may not receive promised compensation if the employer goes bankrupt.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，NQDC为高收入群体提供了额外的税收优化工具；从投资角度看，它帮助员工实现长期财务目标；从行业角度看，它是企业人力资源管理的重要策略之一。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, NQDC provides an additional tax optimization tool for high-income individuals; from an investment perspective, it helps employees achieve long-term financial goals; from an industry perspective, it is a key strategy in corporate human resource management.
