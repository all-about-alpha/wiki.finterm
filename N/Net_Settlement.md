## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **净额结算** 是一种金融结算方式，指在多个交易方之间，通过计算所有应收和应付金额的差额，仅对净额进行实际资金划转。这种方式减少了资金流动的频率和规模，提高了结算效率。

This approach reduces the frequency and scale of fund movements, enhancing settlement efficiency.

  Net settlement is widely used in interbank payment systems, securities clearing, and cross-border trade settlements. For instance, China’s High-Value Payment System (CNAPS) employs net settlement to reduce liquidity risks. However, it may face credit risks and systemic risks, requiring robust regulatory frameworks and risk management tools.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  净额结算的概念最早可追溯到20世纪70年代的国际银行业务中。随着全球贸易和金融活动的增加，传统的全额结算方式效率低下且成本高昂。1974年成立的国际清算银行（BIS）推动了净额结算机制的标准化和应用。中国在20世纪90年代引入这一机制，逐步完善了相关法规和技术支持。  
  The concept of net settlement dates back to international banking in the 1970s. As global trade and financial activities expanded, traditional gross settlement methods became inefficient and costly. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), established in 1974, promoted the standardization and application of net settlement mechanisms. China adopted this mechanism in the 1990s, gradually refining regulations and technical support.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  净额结算显著提升了全球金融市场的效率和稳定性。在中国，它成为大额支付系统和证券清算的核心机制之一，支持了经济的快速发展。在全球范围内，它被广泛应用于外汇交易、衍生品清算等领域，成为国际金融体系的重要支柱。  
  Net settlement has significantly enhanced the efficiency and stability of global financial markets. In China, it has become a core mechanism for high-value payment systems and securities clearing, supporting rapid economic growth. Globally, it is widely used in foreign exchange trading and derivatives clearing, serving as a cornerstone of the international financial system.
