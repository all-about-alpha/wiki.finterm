## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：归一化收益的概念起源于20世纪中期的财务分析实践。随着企业财务报表复杂性的增加，分析师发现一次性事件（如资产出售或诉讼赔偿）会扭曲公司的真实盈利状况。因此，他们开始采用调整方法以剔除这些干扰因素。这一方法逐渐被广泛接受并应用于投资分析和企业估值中。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of normalized earnings originated in mid-20th century financial analysis practices. As corporate financial statements became more complex, analysts realized that one-time events (such as asset sales or litigation settlements) could distort a company's true profitability. Consequently, they began using adjustment methods to eliminate these distortions. This approach gradually gained widespread acceptance and was applied in investment analysis and business valuation.
