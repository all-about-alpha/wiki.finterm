# Nonpassive Income and Losses

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非被动收入与损失（Nonpassive Income and Losses）是指通过主动参与经营活动或劳动所获得的收入或产生的损失。这类收入通常与个人的直接参与或管理活动密切相关，如工资、奖金、自营业务收入等。非被动收入与被动收入（如股息、利息、租金等）相对，后者不需要个人直接参与即可获得。  
  **English Explanation**: Nonpassive income and losses refer to income or losses generated through active participation in business operations or labor. This type of income is typically associated with direct involvement or management activities, such as wages, bonuses, or self-employment income. Nonpassive income contrasts with passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, rental income), which does not require direct personal involvement.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：非被动收入与损失常见于自营职业者、企业主或参与日常经营管理的投资者。例如，一家小型企业的所有者通过日常运营获得的利润属于非被动收入。需要注意的是，非被动收入的税务处理通常与被动收入不同，可能涉及更高的税率或更复杂的申报流程。  
  **English Application**: Nonpassive income and losses are commonly seen among self-employed individuals, business owners, or investors actively involved in daily operations. For example, profits earned by a small business owner through daily operations qualify as nonpassive income. It is important to note that the tax treatment of nonpassive income often differs from passive income, potentially involving higher tax rates or more complex filing procedures.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，非被动收入与损失的区分对税务申报和合规至关重要。从投资角度看，了解非被动收入有助于评估个人或企业的财务健康状况。从行业角度看，非被动收入反映了经济活动的活跃程度，是衡量经济增长的重要指标之一。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, distinguishing nonpassive income and losses is crucial for tax reporting and compliance. From an investment standpoint, understanding nonpassive income helps assess the financial health of individuals or businesses. From an industry perspective, nonpassive income reflects the level of economic activity and serves as a key indicator of economic growth.
