# Nonperforming Loan (NPL)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：不良贷款（Nonperforming Loan, NPL）是指借款人未能按照贷款协议的规定按时偿还本金和利息，且银行或金融机构认为该贷款存在较高违约风险的贷款。通常，贷款逾期超过90天即被视为不良贷款。  
  **English Explanation**: A Nonperforming Loan (NPL) refers to a loan where the borrower has failed to make scheduled payments of principal or interest as per the loan agreement, and the bank or financial institution considers it to be at high risk of default. Typically, a loan is classified as nonperforming if payments are overdue by more than 90 days.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：不良贷款在银行业务中是一个重要的风险指标。银行需要通过严格的信贷审查和风险管理来减少不良贷款的产生。在中国，监管机构如中国银保监会（CBIRC）会定期发布不良贷款率，以监控金融系统的稳定性。  
  **English Explanation**: Nonperforming loans are a critical risk indicator in banking operations. Banks need to implement rigorous credit reviews and risk management practices to minimize the occurrence of NPLs. In China, regulatory bodies such as the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) regularly publish NPL ratios to monitor the stability of the financial system.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，控制不良贷款率是维护金融系统稳定的关键。从投资角度看，高比例的不良贷款可能预示着银行的资产质量下降，影响投资者信心。从行业角度看，不良贷款的处置和回收是银行业务的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, controlling the NPL ratio is crucial for maintaining financial system stability. From an investment standpoint, a high NPL ratio may indicate declining asset quality in banks, affecting investor confidence. From an industry perspective, the resolution and recovery of NPLs are significant components of banking operations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：不良贷款的概念起源于20世纪初的银行业务实践。随着金融市场的复杂化，银行开始意识到需要对无法收回的贷款进行分类和管理。1997年亚洲金融危机后，各国银行对不良贷款的重视程度显著提高。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of nonperforming loans originated from banking practices in the early 20th century. As financial markets became more complex, banks began to recognize the need to classify and manage loans that were unlikely to be repaid. The importance of NPLs was significantly heightened after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：在中国，2000年代初的国有银行改革中，大量不良贷款被剥离至资产管理公司进行处理。这一举措显著改善了银行的资产质量，并为后续的金融改革奠定了基础。目前，中国银行业的不良贷款率在全球范围内处于较低水平。  
  **English Explanation**: In China, during the state-owned bank reforms in the early 2000s, a large volume of NPLs was transferred to asset management companies for resolution. This move significantly improved bank asset quality and laid the groundwork for subsequent financial reforms. Currently, China's banking sector maintains a relatively low NPL ratio globally.
