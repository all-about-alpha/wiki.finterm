## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：“Nanny Tax”起源于20世纪90年代的美国，当时美国政府发现许多家庭在雇佣保姆时未按规定缴纳税款和社会保障费用。1994年，《家庭雇员税法》（Domestic Employee Tax Act）正式实施，要求雇主为符合条件的家庭雇员缴纳相关税费。这一制度的推出旨在填补税收漏洞并保障家庭雇员的权益。  
  **English Origin**: The Nanny Tax originated in the United States in the 1990s when it was discovered that many families were not paying taxes or social security contributions for their domestic workers. In 1994, the Domestic Employee Tax Act was enacted, requiring employers to pay relevant taxes for eligible domestic employees. This system was introduced to close tax loopholes and protect workers' rights.
