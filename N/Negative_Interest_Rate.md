# Negative Interest Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **负利率**是指中央银行或商业银行对存款或贷款收取的利率低于零的现象。这意味着储户在银行存钱时，不仅无法获得利息，反而需要支付费用给银行。负利率政策通常由中央银行实施，旨在刺激经济增长和对抗通缩。  
  **Negative Interest Rate** refers to a situation where the central bank or commercial banks charge an interest rate below zero on deposits or loans. This means that depositors not only fail to earn interest on their savings but may also have to pay fees to the bank. Negative interest rate policies are typically implemented by central banks to stimulate economic growth and combat deflation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  负利率政策在全球范围内被用于应对经济衰退和通缩压力。例如，欧洲央行和日本央行曾实施负利率以鼓励借贷和消费，从而提振经济。然而，负利率也可能导致银行利润下降、储户转向现金或其他资产，以及金融市场的不稳定性增加。  
  Negative interest rate policies have been used globally to address economic recessions and deflationary pressures. For instance, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have implemented negative rates to encourage borrowing and spending, thereby boosting the economy. However, negative rates can also lead to reduced bank profitability, depositors shifting to cash or other assets, and increased financial market instability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，负利率是中央银行在传统货币政策工具失效时的非常规手段；从投资角度看，它改变了资产配置的逻辑；从行业角度看，银行业面临盈利压力和业务模式调整的挑战。  
  From a regulatory perspective, negative rates are unconventional tools used by central banks when traditional monetary policy tools fail; from an investment perspective, they alter asset allocation logic; from an industry perspective, banks face challenges in profitability and business model adjustments.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  负利率的概念最早可追溯到20世纪的经济理论探讨，但实际应用始于21世纪。2009年瑞典央行首次实施负利率政策，随后欧洲央行（2014年）和日本央行（2016年）也相继采用这一政策以应对各自的经济困境。  
  The concept of negative interest rates dates back to economic theories in the 20th century but was first practically implemented in the 21st century. The Swedish Riksbank pioneered this policy in 2009, followed by the European Central Bank (2014) and the Bank of Japan (2016) to address their respective economic challenges.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  负利率政策在全球范围内引发了广泛讨论和实践。它在一定程度上刺激了经济增长和通胀回升，但也带来了银行业盈利能力下降、储蓄行为改变以及金融市场波动加剧等问题。目前，部分国家已逐步退出负利率政策，但其影响仍在持续。  
  Negative interest rate policies have sparked widespread discussion and practice globally. They have somewhat stimulated economic growth and inflation recovery but also led to reduced bank profitability, changes in saving behaviors, and increased financial market volatility. Currently, some countries are gradually phasing out negative rates, but their impact persists.
