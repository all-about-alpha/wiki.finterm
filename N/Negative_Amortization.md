# Negative Amortization

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 负摊销（Negative Amortization）是指贷款还款过程中，由于每月还款额不足以支付当期利息，导致未偿还本金增加的现象。这种现象通常出现在可调整利率贷款（ARM）或允许最低还款额低于利息的贷款产品中。  
  **English Explanation**: Negative amortization occurs when the monthly payment on a loan is insufficient to cover the interest due, resulting in an increase in the outstanding principal balance. This typically happens with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or loans that allow minimum payments below the interest amount.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 负摊销常见于某些类型的抵押贷款或学生贷款中，借款人可以选择支付低于利息的金额，以减轻短期还款压力。然而，长期来看，未偿还本金的增加可能导致更高的总还款额和财务风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Negative amortization is often seen in certain types of mortgages or student loans where borrowers can opt to pay less than the interest due, easing short-term repayment burdens. However, over time, the increase in unpaid principal can lead to higher total repayment amounts and financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，负摊销可能被视为高风险金融产品，需加强信息披露和消费者保护。从投资和行业角度，理解负摊销有助于评估贷款产品的潜在风险和收益。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, negative amortization may be viewed as a high-risk financial product requiring enhanced disclosure and consumer protection. From an investment and industry standpoint, understanding negative amortization helps assess the potential risks and rewards of loan products.
