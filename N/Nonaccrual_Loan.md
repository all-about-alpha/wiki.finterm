# Nonaccrual Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非应计贷款（Nonaccrual Loan）是指银行或金融机构认为借款人无法按时偿还本金或利息，因此停止将应收利息计入收入的贷款。这类贷款通常被视为高风险资产，银行会将其从正常贷款中剥离，并计提相应的坏账准备。  
  **English Explanation**: A nonaccrual loan is a loan that a bank or financial institution has determined the borrower is unlikely to repay the principal or interest on time, and thus stops accruing interest income. Such loans are typically classified as high-risk assets, and banks will separate them from performing loans and set aside provisions for potential losses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：非应计贷款常见于借款人财务状况恶化、破产或长期拖欠的情况下。银行会根据借款人的还款能力和贷款风险，将贷款从正常状态转为非应计状态。此类贷款的管理需要严格的风险控制措施，以避免对银行资产质量造成重大影响。  
  **English Application**: Nonaccrual loans are commonly seen in situations where the borrower's financial condition deteriorates, such as bankruptcy or prolonged delinquency. Banks will reclassify loans from performing to nonaccrual status based on the borrower's repayment ability and loan risk. Managing such loans requires stringent risk control measures to prevent significant impacts on the bank's asset quality.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，非应计贷款是衡量银行资产质量的重要指标之一。监管机构要求银行定期披露非应计贷款的比例，以评估其风险承受能力。从投资角度看，非应计贷款的增加可能预示着银行未来盈利能力的下降。从行业角度看，非应计贷款的管理能力反映了银行的整体风险管理水平。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, nonaccrual loans are a key indicator of a bank's asset quality. Regulators require banks to regularly disclose the proportion of nonaccrual loans to assess their risk tolerance. From an investment perspective, an increase in nonaccrual loans may signal a decline in the bank's future profitability. From an industry perspective, the ability to manage nonaccrual loans reflects the bank's overall risk management capabilities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：非应计贷款的概念起源于20世纪80年代的美国银行业危机。当时，由于经济衰退和房地产市场的崩溃，大量贷款无法按时偿还，银行开始采用非应计贷款的分类方式来管理高风险资产。这一做法后来被全球银行业广泛采纳，并成为国际会计准则的一部分。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of nonaccrual loans originated during the U.S. banking crisis in the 1980s. At that time, due to economic recession and the collapse of the real estate market, a large number of loans became delinquent, and banks began using the nonaccrual classification to manage high-risk assets. This practice was later widely adopted by the global banking industry and became part of international accounting standards.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：非应计贷款的分类对银行业产生了深远影响。它不仅帮助银行更准确地评估资产质量，还促使银行加强风险管理。如今，非应计贷款已成为全球银行业监管和风险管理的重要工具，特别是在金融危机期间，其重要性更加凸显。  
  **English Impact**: The classification of nonaccrual loans has had a profound impact on the banking industry. It not only helps banks more accurately assess asset quality but also encourages banks to strengthen risk management. Today, nonaccrual loans have become an essential tool for global banking regulation and risk management, particularly during financial crises, where their importance is even more pronounced.
