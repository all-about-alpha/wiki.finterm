# Non-Operating Income

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非营业收入是指企业在日常经营活动之外获得的收入，通常与主营业务无关。这类收入可能来源于投资收益、资产处置收益、政府补贴等。非营业收入的核心概念在于其不依赖于企业的核心业务活动，而是由其他偶然或非经常性事件产生。  
  **English Explanation**: Non-operating income refers to revenue generated by a company outside its regular business operations, typically unrelated to its core activities. This type of income may come from investment returns, asset disposal gains, government subsidies, etc. The core concept of non-operating income lies in its independence from the company's primary business activities, arising instead from incidental or non-recurring events.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：非营业收入常见于企业财务报表中，用于反映企业在主营业务之外的财务表现。例如，一家制造企业可能通过出售闲置设备或获得政府补贴来增加非营业收入。需要注意的是，非营业收入通常具有不稳定性，投资者在分析企业财务状况时应谨慎对待。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Non-operating income is commonly found in corporate financial statements, reflecting the company's financial performance outside its core operations. For instance, a manufacturing firm might increase non-operating income by selling idle equipment or receiving government subsidies. It is important to note that non-operating income is often volatile, and investors should exercise caution when analyzing a company's financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，非营业收入的披露有助于提高财务透明度；从投资角度看，它影响企业的整体盈利能力和估值；从行业角度看，高比例的非营业收入可能暗示企业核心业务的薄弱。因此，非营业收入在财务分析和决策中具有重要参考价值。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the disclosure of non-operating income enhances financial transparency; from an investment standpoint, it impacts the company's overall profitability and valuation; from an industry perspective, a high proportion of non-operating income may indicate weaknesses in the core business. Thus, non-operating income holds significant reference value in financial analysis and decision-making.
