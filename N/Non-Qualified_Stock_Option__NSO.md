# Non-Qualified Stock Option (NSO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非限定股票期权（Non-Qualified Stock Option, NSO）是一种由公司授予员工或顾问的股票期权，允许他们在特定时间内以预先确定的价格购买公司股票。与激励性股票期权（ISO）不同，NSO在行权时需缴纳普通所得税，且不享有税收优惠。  
  **English Explanation**: A Non-Qualified Stock Option (NSO) is a type of stock option granted by a company to employees or consultants, allowing them to purchase company shares at a predetermined price within a specified period. Unlike Incentive Stock Options (ISOs), NSOs are subject to ordinary income tax upon exercise and do not qualify for tax benefits.
