# Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

Net debt is calculated as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents, while EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) represents a company's core earnings before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This ratio indicates how well a company can cover its debt obligations with its core profitability.
