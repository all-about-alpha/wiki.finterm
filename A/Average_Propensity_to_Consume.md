# Average Propensity to Consume

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：平均消费倾向（Average Propensity to Consume, APC）是指在一定时期内，消费支出占可支配收入的比例。它反映了消费者将收入用于消费的总体倾向，是衡量经济中消费行为的重要指标。这一概念由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出，核心概念是消费与收入之间的关系。  
  - **English Explanation**: The Average Propensity to Consume (APC) refers to the ratio of consumption expenditure to disposable income over a specific period. It reflects the overall tendency of consumers to spend their income on consumption and is a key metric for understanding consumer behavior in an economy. This concept was introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes in his work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*, with the core idea being the relationship between consumption and income.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：平均消费倾向常用于宏观经济分析中，帮助政府和经济学家评估消费者的支出行为及其对经济增长的影响。例如，在经济衰退期间，平均消费倾向可能下降，表明消费者更倾向于储蓄而非消费。风险提示：该指标可能受到收入分配不均、消费者信心波动等因素的影响，需结合其他经济指标综合分析。  
  - **English Application**: The APC is widely used in macroeconomic analysis to help governments and economists assess consumer spending behavior and its impact on economic growth. For instance, during an economic downturn, the APC may decline, indicating that consumers prefer saving over spending. Risk Note: This metric can be influenced by factors such as income inequality and fluctuations in consumer confidence, so it should be analyzed alongside other economic indicators.

From an investment standpoint, it helps investors predict the performance of consumer-driven industries.
