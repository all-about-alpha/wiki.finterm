  应计费用（Accrued Expense）是指企业在会计期间内已经发生但尚未实际支付的费用。这类费用通常是由于时间差异导致的，例如员工工资、利息费用或租赁费用等。根据权责发生制原则，即使费用尚未支付，只要已经发生，就应在财务报表中确认。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accrued Expense refers to expenses that have been incurred by a business during an accounting period but have not yet been paid. These expenses typically arise due to timing differences, such as employee wages, interest expenses, or lease payments.
