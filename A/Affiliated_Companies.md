# Affiliated Companies

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：关联公司（Affiliated Companies）是指通过股权、协议或其他方式相互之间存在控制或重大影响关系的公司。通常，一家公司持有另一家公司一定比例的股份（如20%-50%），从而能够对其经营决策产生重大影响，但并不完全控制。关联公司之间的关系可以是母子公司、兄弟公司或其他形式的关联关系。  
  **English Explanation**: Affiliated Companies refer to companies that are connected through ownership, agreements, or other means, where one company has significant influence over another but does not fully control it. Typically, one company holds a certain percentage of shares (e.g., 20%-50%) in another, allowing it to exert substantial influence over its business decisions. The relationship can be parent-subsidiary, sibling companies, or other forms of affiliation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：关联公司在商业实践中广泛应用于集团化经营、资源共享和风险分散。例如，母公司通过关联公司进入新市场或行业，或通过关联交易实现税务优化。然而，关联交易也可能引发利益输送、财务不透明等问题，因此受到监管机构的严格审查。  
  **English Explanation**: Affiliated companies are widely used in business practices for group operations, resource sharing, and risk diversification. For example, a parent company may enter new markets or industries through affiliated companies or optimize taxes through related-party transactions. However, such transactions may also lead to issues like profit shifting and financial opacity, attracting strict scrutiny from regulators.

* **重要性 / Significance**

  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, affiliated company relationships are a key focus in antitrust and corporate governance to prevent abuse of market dominance.

From an industry perspective, affiliated companies help businesses achieve strategic synergies and economies of scale.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：关联公司的概念起源于19世纪末的工业化时期，随着企业集团化和跨国经营的兴起而发展。例如，美国标准石油公司（Standard Oil）通过控股多家子公司形成了庞大的关联公司网络。20世纪初，各国开始制定相关法规，规范关联公司行为。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of affiliated companies originated in the late 19th century during the industrialization era, evolving with the rise of corporate groups and multinational operations. For instance, Standard Oil in the U.S. established a vast network of affiliated companies through holding stakes in multiple subsidiaries. By the early 20th century, countries began enacting regulations to govern the behavior of affiliated companies.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：关联公司模式对全球商业格局产生了深远影响，推动了企业集团化和全球化进程。然而，关联交易的不透明性也引发了多次财务丑闻，如安然事件（Enron Scandal），促使各国加强监管。目前，关联公司仍是企业扩张和资源整合的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**: The affiliated company model has profoundly impacted the global business landscape, driving corporate group formation and globalization.
