  累计折旧（Accumulated Depreciation）是会计学中的一个重要概念，指固定资产在使用过程中因磨损、老化或技术过时而逐渐减少的价值总和。它是固定资产原值的抵减项，反映了资产在使用期间的价值损耗。累计折旧通常以折旧费用的形式逐年计提，并在资产负债表中作为固定资产的减项列示。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accumulated Depreciation is a key accounting concept that represents the total reduction in the value of a fixed asset over its useful life due to wear and tear, aging, or obsolescence. It is a contra-asset account that offsets the original cost of the asset and reflects the cumulative depreciation expense recorded over time. It is typically shown as a deduction from the gross value of fixed assets on the balance sheet.
