# Assumable Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：可承继抵押贷款（Assumable Mortgage）是指购房者在购买房产时，可以选择承接卖方原有的抵押贷款合同，而无需重新申请新的贷款。这种贷款通常保留了原合同的利率、期限和其他条款，买方只需支付差额部分（如房价高于贷款余额的部分）。可承继抵押贷款常见于固定利率贷款，尤其是在利率上升的市场环境中，因其能为买方节省利息成本。  
  **English Explanation**: An assumable mortgage is a type of mortgage that allows a homebuyer to take over the seller's existing mortgage contract, including its interest rate, term, and other conditions, without needing to apply for a new loan. The buyer typically pays the difference between the home price and the remaining loan balance. Assumable mortgages are often associated with fixed-rate loans and are particularly attractive in rising interest rate environments due to their potential to save on interest costs.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：可承继抵押贷款适用于利率上升时期，买方可以通过承接卖方较低利率的贷款来降低购房成本。此外，这种贷款方式也适用于卖方希望快速出售房产的情况，因为买方无需等待贷款审批。然而，买方需注意原贷款合同中可能存在的限制条款，如提前还款罚金或贷款转让费用。  
  **English Application**: Assumable mortgages are useful in rising interest rate environments, as buyers can benefit from the seller's lower interest rate, reducing overall costs. They are also advantageous when sellers aim to expedite the sale process, as buyers avoid the delays of loan approval. However, buyers should be cautious of potential restrictions in the original loan contract, such as prepayment penalties or transfer fees.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，可承继抵押贷款有助于稳定房地产市场，特别是在利率波动较大的时期。从投资角度看，它为买方提供了更具吸引力的融资选择，同时为卖方提供了更灵活的销售策略。从行业角度看，这种贷款方式促进了房产交易的流动性，尤其是在高利率环境下。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, assumable mortgages help stabilize the real estate market, especially during periods of significant interest rate fluctuations. From an investment standpoint, they offer buyers a more attractive financing option while providing sellers with greater flexibility. From an industry perspective, they enhance transaction liquidity, particularly in high-interest-rate environments.
