# Autonomous Consumption

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：自主消费（Autonomous Consumption）是指消费者在收入为零时仍然需要进行的消费支出。这种消费不依赖于当前收入水平，而是由基本生活需求、习惯或社会规范驱动。它是消费函数中的一个重要组成部分，通常表示为消费函数中的常数项。  
  **English Explanation**: Autonomous Consumption refers to the level of consumption that occurs even when income is zero. This type of consumption is independent of current income levels and is driven by basic living needs, habits, or social norms. It is a key component of the consumption function, often represented as the constant term in the function.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：自主消费在宏观经济分析中用于解释经济衰退或收入下降时，消费水平不会完全随收入减少而下降的现象。例如，在经济危机期间，即使家庭收入大幅减少，人们仍会维持一定的基本消费（如食品、住房等）。需要注意的是，自主消费的稳定性可能受到外部冲击（如物价上涨或政策变化）的影响。  
  **English Application**: Autonomous Consumption is used in macroeconomic analysis to explain why consumption levels do not fully decline with income during economic downturns. For example, during a financial crisis, households may still maintain a certain level of basic consumption (e.g., food, housing) even if their income drops significantly. It is important to note that the stability of autonomous consumption can be affected by external shocks, such as price increases or policy changes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，自主消费是制定社会保障政策的重要参考，因为它反映了居民的最低生活需求。从投资角度看，了解自主消费有助于预测消费市场的韧性。从行业角度看，与基本生活需求相关的行业（如食品、医疗）在经济波动中表现相对稳定。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, autonomous consumption is a key reference for designing social security policies, as it reflects the minimum living needs of the population. From an investment perspective, understanding autonomous consumption helps predict the resilience of consumer markets. From an industry perspective, sectors related to basic living needs (e.g., food, healthcare) tend to remain stable during economic fluctuations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：自主消费的概念最早由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在其1936年出版的《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出。凯恩斯认为，消费不仅取决于当前收入，还受到心理因素和社会习惯的影响。这一理论为现代宏观经济学中的消费函数奠定了基础。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of autonomous consumption was first introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 book *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*. Keynes argued that consumption depends not only on current income but also on psychological factors and social habits. This theory laid the foundation for the consumption function in modern macroeconomics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：自主消费理论对经济学和政策制定产生了深远影响。它帮助解释了经济周期中消费行为的稳定性，并为政府制定经济刺激政策提供了理论依据。如今，自主消费已成为宏观经济模型中的核心变量之一。  
  **English Impact**: The theory of autonomous consumption has had a profound impact on economics and policy-making. It helps explain the stability of consumption behavior during economic cycles and provides a theoretical basis for governments to design economic stimulus policies. Today, autonomous consumption is one of the core variables in macroeconomic models.
