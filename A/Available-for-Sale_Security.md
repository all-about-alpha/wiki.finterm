## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：可供出售金融资产（Available-for-Sale Security）是指企业持有的既不以交易为目的，也不以持有至到期为目的的金融资产。这类资产通常以公允价值计量，其未实现的损益计入其他综合收益（OCI），直到资产被出售时才转入当期损益。  
  **English Explanation**: An Available-for-Sale Security refers to a financial asset that is neither held for trading nor intended to be held until maturity.
