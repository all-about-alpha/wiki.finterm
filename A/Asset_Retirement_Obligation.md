  **中文解释**：资产弃置义务（Asset Retirement Obligation, ARO）是指企业在使用某项资产时，因法律、合同或其他义务而承担的资产报废、拆除或恢复环境的责任。这一义务通常与固定资产（如石油钻井平台、核电站或矿山）相关，企业需要在资产使用寿命结束时履行相关义务。核心概念包括未来现金流的现值计算、义务的确认和计量。  
  **English Explanation**: An Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) refers to a legal, contractual, or other obligation that a company must fulfill to retire, dismantle, or restore an asset at the end of its useful life. This obligation is typically associated with fixed assets such as oil rigs, nuclear power plants, or mines. Key concepts include the present value of future cash flows, recognition, and measurement of the obligation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：资产弃置义务广泛应用于石油、天然气、采矿和核能等行业。例如，石油公司在开采结束后需拆除钻井平台并恢复海洋环境。企业在财务报表中需确认ARO，并定期调整其现值以反映时间推移和利率变化。风险包括义务金额的不确定性、环境法规的变化以及技术挑战。  
  **English Application**: ARO is widely applied in industries such as oil and gas, mining, and nuclear energy. For example, oil companies must dismantle drilling platforms and restore marine environments after extraction. Companies must recognize ARO in financial statements and periodically adjust its present value to reflect the passage of time and changes in interest rates. Risks include uncertainty in obligation amounts, changes in environmental regulations, and technical challenges.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：资产弃置义务的概念起源于20世纪70年代，随着环境保护意识的增强和相关法规的出台（如美国的《清洁空气法》和《清洁水法》），企业开始被要求承担资产报废后的环境恢复责任。2001年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）发布FAS 143准则，正式规范了ARO的会计处理。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of ARO emerged in the 1970s with the rise of environmental awareness and the introduction of regulations such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act in the United States. Companies were required to assume responsibility for environmental restoration after asset retirement. In 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 143, formally standardizing the accounting treatment of ARO.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：ARO的引入对石油、天然气和采矿等行业产生了深远影响。企业需在资产购置时预估并确认ARO，这增加了财务报表的复杂性。同时，ARO的合理管理推动了环保技术的发展，促进了行业的可持续发展。目前，ARO已成为全球范围内企业环境责任的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of ARO has had a profound impact on industries such as oil and gas, and mining. Companies must estimate and recognize ARO at the time of asset acquisition, increasing the complexity of financial reporting. Meanwhile, effective management of ARO has driven the development of environmental technologies and promoted sustainable industry practices. Today, ARO is a critical component of corporate environmental responsibility worldwide.
