  合格投资者（Accredited Investor）是指符合特定财务标准或专业资质的个人或机构，具备足够的财务实力或专业知识，能够承担高风险投资。这一概念最早由美国证券交易委员会（SEC）在《1933年证券法》中提出，旨在保护普通投资者免受高风险金融产品的潜在损失。核心概念包括收入、净资产、专业经验等标准。  

  **English Explanation**：  
  An Accredited Investor is an individual or entity that meets specific financial criteria or professional qualifications, demonstrating sufficient financial strength or expertise to undertake high-risk investments. This concept was originally introduced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933 to protect ordinary investors from potential losses associated with high-risk financial products. Key criteria include income, net worth, and professional experience.

  合格投资者通常参与私募股权、对冲基金、风险投资等高风险高回报的投资领域。在中国，合格投资者的认定标准由证监会制定，通常要求个人年收入不低于一定金额或金融资产达到一定规模。需要注意的是，合格投资者虽然具备较高的风险承受能力，但仍需谨慎评估投资风险。

  Accredited Investors typically participate in high-risk, high-return investment areas such as private equity, hedge funds, and venture capital. In China, the criteria for accredited investors are set by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), usually requiring individuals to meet specific income or financial asset thresholds. It is important to note that while accredited investors have a higher risk tolerance, they must still carefully assess investment risks.
