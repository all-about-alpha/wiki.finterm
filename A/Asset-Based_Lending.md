# Asset-Based Lending

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资产抵押贷款（Asset-Based Lending, ABL）是一种以借款人的资产（如应收账款、存货、设备等）作为抵押的融资方式。贷款金额通常基于抵押资产的价值，而非借款人的信用评级。这种贷款方式常见于中小企业或现金流不稳定的企业，为其提供灵活的融资解决方案。  
  **English Explanation**: Asset-Based Lending (ABL) is a financing method where the borrower's assets (such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, etc.) are used as collateral. The loan amount is typically based on the value of the collateral rather than the borrower's credit rating. This type of lending is commonly used by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or companies with unstable cash flows, providing them with flexible financing solutions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：资产抵押贷款广泛应用于制造业、批发业和零售业等需要大量流动资金的行业。企业可以通过抵押应收账款或存货获得短期资金支持，缓解现金流压力。然而，这种贷款方式的风险在于资产价值的波动性，若抵押资产贬值，可能导致贷款违约。  
  **English Explanation**: Asset-Based Lending is widely used in industries such as manufacturing, wholesale, and retail, which require significant working capital. Companies can obtain short-term funding by pledging accounts receivable or inventory, alleviating cash flow pressures. However, the risk lies in the volatility of asset values; if the collateral depreciates, it may lead to loan default.

  **English Explanation**: Asset-Based Lending plays a crucial role in the financial system, particularly by providing essential financing channels for SMEs. From a regulatory perspective, it helps reduce credit risk for financial institutions; from an investment perspective, it offers diversified investment options; and from an industry perspective, it promotes economic liquidity and sustainable business growth.
