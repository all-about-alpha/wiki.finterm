# Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    调整后总收入（Adjusted Gross Income, AGI）是指个人或家庭在一定纳税年度内，从所有来源获得的总收入，减去特定的扣除项（如学生贷款利息、退休账户贡献等）后得到的金额。AGI 是计算应纳税所得额的基础，直接影响纳税人的税务负担。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) refers to the total income earned by an individual or household from all sources within a tax year, minus specific deductions (such as student loan interest, retirement account contributions, etc.). AGI serves as the basis for calculating taxable income and directly impacts the taxpayer's tax liability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    AGI 主要用于个人所得税申报，是确定纳税人是否符合某些税收优惠或抵扣条件的关键指标。例如，医疗费用抵扣、教育费用抵扣等通常以 AGI 的一定比例作为门槛。此外，AGI 也用于评估个人或家庭的财务健康状况，如申请贷款或政府福利时。  
    **风险提示**：AGI 的计算需准确无误，否则可能导致税务申报错误，引发罚款或审计风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    AGI is primarily used in personal income tax filings and is a key metric for determining eligibility for certain tax credits or deductions. For example, medical expense deductions and education credits often use a percentage of AGI as a threshold. Additionally, AGI is used to assess the financial health of individuals or households, such as when applying for loans or government benefits.  
    **Risk Note**: Accurate calculation of AGI is crucial, as errors can lead to incorrect tax filings, resulting in penalties or audit risks.

    From a regulatory perspective, AGI is a critical metric for tax authorities to assess taxpayers' income levels and tax-paying capacity.
