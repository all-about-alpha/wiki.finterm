# American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：美国机会税收抵免（AOTC）是美国政府为鼓励高等教育而设立的一项税收优惠政策。该政策允许符合条件的纳税人（通常是学生或其家庭）在支付合格教育费用时，申请一定比例的税收抵免。AOTC最初由《2009年美国复苏与再投资法案》引入，旨在减轻家庭在高等教育阶段的经济负担。核心概念包括“合格教育费用”、“符合条件的纳税人”以及“税收抵免额度”。  
  - **English Explanation**: The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a tax incentive program established by the U.S. government to encourage higher education. It allows eligible taxpayers (typically students or their families) to claim a percentage of qualified education expenses as a tax credit. The AOTC was initially introduced under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aiming to alleviate the financial burden of higher education for families. Key concepts include "qualified education expenses," "eligible taxpayers," and "tax credit limits."

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：AOTC适用于支付大学或高等教育学费、书籍和其他相关费用的家庭。符合条件的纳税人可以在报税时申请最高2500美元的税收抵免，其中40%为可退还部分（即使不欠税也可获得）。需要注意的是，AOTC仅适用于前四年的高等教育，且学生需至少半工半读。风险提示包括确保教育机构符合资格、保留相关费用凭证，以及避免重复申请其他教育税收优惠。  
  - **English Application**: The AOTC applies to families paying for college or higher education tuition, books, and other related expenses. Eligible taxpayers can claim up to $2,500 in tax credits when filing taxes, with 40% being refundable (even if no taxes are owed). It is important to note that the AOTC is only available for the first four years of higher education, and the student must be enrolled at least half-time. Risks include ensuring the educational institution is eligible, retaining receipts for expenses, and avoiding duplicate claims with other education tax benefits.
