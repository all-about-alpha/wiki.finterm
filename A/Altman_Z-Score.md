# Altman Z-Score

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Altman Z-Score（阿尔特曼Z值）是由美国学者爱德华·阿尔特曼（Edward Altman）于1968年提出的一种财务模型，用于预测企业破产风险。该模型通过结合多个财务比率（如营运资本/总资产、留存收益/总资产、息税前利润/总资产、市值/负债总额、销售收入/总资产）来计算一个综合得分，从而评估企业的财务健康状况。Z值越高，企业破产风险越低；Z值越低，破产风险越高。  
  **English Explanation**: The Altman Z-Score is a financial model developed by American scholar Edward Altman in 1968 to predict the risk of corporate bankruptcy. The model combines multiple financial ratios (such as working capital/total assets, retained earnings/total assets, EBIT/total assets, market value of equity/total liabilities, and sales/total assets) to calculate a composite score, which assesses a company's financial health. A higher Z-Score indicates lower bankruptcy risk, while a lower Z-Score suggests higher bankruptcy risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：Altman Z-Score广泛应用于企业财务分析、信用评级和投资决策中。例如，银行和金融机构使用Z值评估贷款申请企业的偿债能力；投资者则利用Z值筛选潜在投资标的，规避高风险企业。需要注意的是，Z值模型主要适用于制造业企业，对其他行业（如服务业或高科技企业）的适用性可能有限。  
  **English Explanation**: The Altman Z-Score is widely used in corporate financial analysis, credit rating, and investment decision-making. For instance, banks and financial institutions use the Z-Score to evaluate the solvency of loan applicants, while investors use it to screen potential investment targets and avoid high-risk companies. It is important to note that the Z-Score model is primarily applicable to manufacturing firms and may have limited applicability to other industries, such as services or high-tech companies.

  **中文解释**：Altman Z-Score在金融领域具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它为评估企业财务稳定性提供了量化工具；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者识别潜在的高风险企业；从行业角度看，它推动了财务风险管理的发展。Z值模型至今仍是破产预测领域的重要参考工具。
