# Automatic Stabilizer

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **自动稳定器** 是指在经济波动时，无需政府或中央银行主动干预，能够自动调节经济运行、减缓经济波动的财政或经济机制。其核心概念是通过税收和公共支出等制度设计，在经济扩张时增加税收或减少支出，在经济衰退时减少税收或增加支出，从而稳定经济。  
  **Automatic Stabilizer** refers to fiscal or economic mechanisms that automatically adjust to stabilize the economy during fluctuations without the need for active intervention by the government or central bank. The core concept is to increase taxes or reduce spending during economic expansions and decrease taxes or increase spending during recessions through institutional designs like taxation and public expenditure, thereby stabilizing the economy.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，自动稳定器主要体现在个人所得税、企业所得税以及社会保障支出等方面。例如，经济下行时，失业率上升，失业保险支出自动增加，缓解了居民收入下降的压力；经济过热时，税收收入增加，抑制了过度消费和投资。需要注意的是，自动稳定器的效果依赖于制度的完善性和经济数据的准确性。  
  In China, automatic stabilizers are primarily reflected in personal income tax, corporate income tax, and social security expenditures. For example, during economic downturns, rising unemployment triggers automatic increases in unemployment insurance payments, alleviating the pressure of declining household income. During economic overheating, increased tax revenues help curb excessive consumption and investment. It is important to note that the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers depends on the robustness of the system and the accuracy of economic data.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，自动稳定器是财政政策的重要组成部分，能够减少政策滞后性，提高经济调控效率。从投资角度看，自动稳定器的存在降低了经济波动对市场的冲击，增强了投资者信心。从行业角度看，自动稳定器有助于平滑经济周期，为企业提供更稳定的经营环境。  
  From a regulatory perspective, automatic stabilizers are a crucial component of fiscal policy, reducing policy lag and improving economic regulation efficiency. From an investment perspective, the presence of automatic stabilizers mitigates the impact of economic fluctuations on markets, boosting investor confidence. From an industry perspective, automatic stabilizers help smooth economic cycles, providing businesses with a more stable operating environment.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  自动稳定器的概念最早由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在20世纪30年代提出，作为其宏观经济理论的一部分。凯恩斯认为，经济波动是不可避免的，但通过设计自动调节机制，可以减少政府对经济的频繁干预。这一理论在二战后被广泛应用于各国的财政政策设计中。  
  The concept of automatic stabilizers was first proposed by economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s as part of his macroeconomic theory. Keynes argued that economic fluctuations are inevitable, but by designing automatic adjustment mechanisms, the need for frequent government intervention could be reduced. This theory was widely adopted in the fiscal policy designs of various countries after World War II.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  自动稳定器在全球范围内被广泛应用，成为现代财政政策的重要工具。在中国，随着经济体制改革的深化，自动稳定器的作用逐渐凸显，特别是在应对2008年全球金融危机和2020年新冠疫情冲击时，发挥了重要作用。目前，自动稳定器已成为中国宏观经济调控体系的重要组成部分。  
  Automatic stabilizers have been widely adopted globally and have become an essential tool in modern fiscal policy. In China, with the deepening of economic reforms, the role of automatic stabilizers has become increasingly prominent, particularly in responding to the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Today, automatic stabilizers are a key component of China's macroeconomic regulation system.
