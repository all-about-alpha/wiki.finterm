# Anti-Dumping Duty

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    反倾销税（Anti-Dumping Duty）是一种进口关税，旨在防止外国生产商以低于其国内市场或生产成本的价格向本国市场倾销商品，从而保护本国产业免受不公平竞争的影响。反倾销税通常由进口国的政府根据世界贸易组织（WTO）的相关规则征收。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Anti-Dumping Duty is a type of import tariff designed to prevent foreign producers from dumping goods into a domestic market at prices lower than their home market or production costs, thereby protecting domestic industries from unfair competition. It is typically imposed by the importing country's government in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    反倾销税通常应用于国际贸易中，当进口商品的价格低于其正常价值（如生产成本或国内市场价格）时，进口国政府可以启动反倾销调查。如果调查确认存在倾销行为，政府将征收反倾销税以抵消倾销带来的损害。常见的应用场景包括钢铁、化工、电子产品等行业。需要注意的是，反倾销税的征收必须符合WTO规则，否则可能引发贸易争端。  
  - **English Application**  
    Anti-Dumping Duty is commonly applied in international trade when the price of imported goods is lower than their normal value (such as production costs or domestic market prices). The importing country's government may initiate an anti-dumping investigation. If the investigation confirms dumping, the government will impose anti-dumping duties to offset the harm caused by dumping. Common application scenarios include industries such as steel, chemicals, and electronics. It is important to note that the imposition of anti-dumping duties must comply with WTO rules, or it may lead to trade disputes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    反倾销税在保护本国产业免受不公平竞争方面具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它是维护市场公平竞争的重要工具；从投资角度看，它有助于稳定市场预期，保护投资者利益；从行业角度看，它为国内企业提供了应对国际竞争的保护措施。然而，过度使用反倾销税也可能导致贸易保护主义，影响全球贸易自由化进程。  
  - **English Significance**  
    Anti-Dumping Duty plays a crucial role in protecting domestic industries from unfair competition. From a regulatory perspective, it is an essential tool for maintaining fair market competition. From an investment perspective, it helps stabilize market expectations and protect investor interests. From an industry perspective, it provides domestic companies with protective measures against international competition. However, excessive use of anti-dumping duties may lead to trade protectionism, affecting the progress of global trade liberalization.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    反倾销税的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪初，随着国际贸易的迅速发展，各国开始意识到倾销行为对本国产业的威胁。1947年，关税与贸易总协定（GATT）首次将反倾销规则纳入国际贸易框架。1995年，世界贸易组织（WTO）成立后，反倾销规则被进一步细化和完善，成为全球贸易体系的重要组成部分。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of Anti-Dumping Duty dates back to the early 20th century, as international trade rapidly expanded, countries began to recognize the threat of dumping to their domestic industries. In 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) first incorporated anti-dumping rules into the international trade framework. After the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, anti-dumping rules were further refined and became an integral part of the global trade system.

  - **English Impact**  
    The introduction of Anti-Dumping Duty has had a profound impact on the global trade landscape. It has helped many countries protect their domestic industries, especially in developing countries, where anti-dumping duties have become a crucial tool against low-price dumping by developed countries.
