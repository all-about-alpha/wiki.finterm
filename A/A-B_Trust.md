# A-B Trust

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：A-B信托是一种遗产规划工具，通常由夫妻共同设立，旨在最大化利用遗产税免税额。该信托将资产分为两部分：A信托（也称为“生存者信托”或“婚姻信托”）和B信托（也称为“家庭信托”或“豁免信托”）。A信托在配偶一方去世后为生存配偶提供收入，而B信托则利用已故配偶的遗产税免税额，确保资产在生存配偶去世后能够免税转移给子女或其他受益人。  
  **English Explanation**: An A-B Trust is an estate planning tool typically established by married couples to maximize the use of estate tax exemptions. The trust divides assets into two parts: the A Trust (also known as the Survivor's Trust or Marital Trust) and the B Trust (also known as the Family Trust or Exemption Trust). The A Trust provides income for the surviving spouse after one spouse passes away, while the B Trust utilizes the deceased spouse's estate tax exemption to ensure that assets can be transferred tax-free to children or other beneficiaries after the surviving spouse's death.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：A-B信托常用于高净值家庭的遗产规划，特别是在美国等存在遗产税的国家。通过合理设置A-B信托，夫妻可以确保在双方去世后，资产能够高效且免税地转移给下一代。需要注意的是，A-B信托的设立和管理需要专业的法律和税务建议，以避免潜在的税务风险和法律纠纷。  
  **English Application**: A-B Trusts are commonly used in estate planning for high-net-worth families, particularly in countries like the United States where estate taxes exist. By properly structuring an A-B Trust, couples can ensure that assets are efficiently and tax-free transferred to the next generation after both spouses pass away. It is important to note that the establishment and management of an A-B Trust require professional legal and tax advice to avoid potential tax risks and legal disputes.
