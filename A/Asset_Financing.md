## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  资产融资（Asset Financing）是指企业或个人以其拥有的资产（如设备、房地产、库存等）作为抵押或担保，向金融机构或投资者获取资金的一种融资方式。其核心概念是通过资产的价值来降低融资风险，从而获得更有利的融资条件。资产融资的起源可以追溯到早期的抵押贷款，随着金融市场的发展，逐渐演变为一种多样化的融资工具。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Asset Financing refers to a financing method where businesses or individuals use their owned assets (such as equipment, real estate, inventory, etc.) as collateral or security to obtain funds from financial institutions or investors. The core concept is to reduce financing risks by leveraging the value of assets, thereby securing more favorable financing terms. Its origins can be traced back to early mortgage lending, and it has evolved into a diversified financing tool with the development of financial markets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  资产融资广泛应用于企业扩张、设备采购、库存管理等领域。例如，制造企业可以通过设备抵押融资购买新机器，零售企业可以通过库存融资解决短期资金周转问题。需要注意的是，资产融资的风险在于资产价值波动可能导致抵押物不足，进而影响融资安全。  

  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Asset Financing is widely used in business expansion, equipment procurement, inventory management, and other areas. For example, manufacturing companies can finance the purchase of new machinery through equipment抵押融资, while retail businesses can use inventory financing to address short-term cash flow issues. It is important to note that the risk of asset financing lies in the fluctuation of asset values, which may lead to insufficient collateral and affect financing security.
