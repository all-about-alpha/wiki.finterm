# Assessed Value

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：评估价值（Assessed Value）是指由地方政府或专业评估机构根据市场条件、财产状况和其他相关因素对不动产（如房地产）进行的官方估值。这一估值通常用于计算财产税（房产税）的税基。评估价值可能低于或高于市场价值，具体取决于评估方法和当地法规。  
  **English Explanation**: Assessed Value refers to the official valuation of a property (such as real estate) conducted by local government authorities or professional appraisers based on market conditions, property characteristics, and other relevant factors. This valuation is typically used to determine the tax base for property taxes. The assessed value may be lower or higher than the market value, depending on the appraisal methods and local regulations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：评估价值主要用于地方政府征收财产税的依据。例如，在中国，房产税的试点城市（如上海、重庆）会使用评估价值来确定房产税的税率和税额。此外，评估价值也用于房地产交易、抵押贷款和保险等领域。需要注意的是，评估价值可能因评估方法的不同而产生偏差，投资者和业主应关注其与市场价值的差异。  
  **English Application**: Assessed Value is primarily used by local governments to levy property taxes. For example, in pilot cities for property tax in China (such as Shanghai and Chongqing), assessed value is used to determine tax rates and amounts. Additionally, assessed value is applied in real estate transactions, mortgage lending, and insurance. It is important to note that assessed value may deviate from market value due to differences in appraisal methods, and investors and property owners should be aware of these discrepancies.
