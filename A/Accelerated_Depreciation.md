# Accelerated Depreciation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  加速折旧（Accelerated Depreciation）是一种会计方法，允许企业在资产使用的早期年份计提更高的折旧费用，从而减少应纳税所得额。这种方法的核心在于通过提前确认折旧费用，帮助企业更快地回收资产成本，同时享受税收优惠。加速折旧通常适用于高价值、快速贬值的资产，如机械设备或技术设备。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accelerated Depreciation is an accounting method that allows businesses to claim higher depreciation expenses in the early years of an asset's life, thereby reducing taxable income. The core concept is to recognize depreciation expenses earlier, enabling companies to recover asset costs more quickly while benefiting from tax advantages. This method is typically applied to high-value, rapidly depreciating assets such as machinery or technological equipment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  加速折旧常用于制造业、科技行业等需要大量资本投入的领域。例如，企业购买一台价值100万元的生产设备，采用加速折旧法可以在前几年计提更高的折旧费用，从而减少当期利润和税负。需要注意的是，虽然加速折旧可以带来短期税收优惠，但后期折旧费用会减少，可能导致税负增加。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Accelerated Depreciation is commonly used in industries requiring significant capital investment, such as manufacturing and technology. For example, if a company purchases a production machine worth $1 million, using accelerated depreciation allows higher depreciation expenses in the initial years, reducing current profits and tax liabilities. However, it is important to note that while this method offers short-term tax benefits, depreciation expenses decrease in later years, potentially leading to higher tax burdens.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，加速折旧政策有助于鼓励企业投资新设备和技术，促进产业升级。从投资角度看，企业通过加速折旧可以改善现金流，增强财务灵活性。从行业角度看，这一方法特别适用于资产更新速度快的行业，如科技和制造业。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, accelerated depreciation policies encourage businesses to invest in new equipment and technology, promoting industrial upgrading. From an investment standpoint, companies can improve cash flow and enhance financial flexibility through accelerated depreciation. From an industry perspective, this method is particularly beneficial for sectors with rapid asset turnover, such as technology and manufacturing.
