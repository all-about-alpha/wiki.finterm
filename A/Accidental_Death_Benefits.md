* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：意外死亡保险金（Accidental Death Benefits）是指在保险合同中约定，若被保险人在保险期间内因意外事故导致死亡，保险公司将向受益人支付的一笔特定金额的保险金。该保险金通常作为主险的附加条款存在，旨在为意外死亡提供额外的经济保障。  
  **English Explanation**: Accidental Death Benefits refer to a specific sum of money paid by an insurance company to the beneficiary if the insured dies due to an accident during the policy period. This benefit is typically offered as a rider to a primary insurance policy, providing additional financial protection in the event of accidental death.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：意外死亡保险金通常适用于高风险职业人群或经常从事危险活动的人士，如建筑工人、飞行员或极限运动爱好者。投保时需注意，保险公司可能对“意外事故”有严格定义，通常不包括疾病、自杀或自然死亡等情况。此外，某些高风险活动可能被列为除外责任，需仔细阅读条款。  
  **English Explanation**: Accidental Death Benefits are often suitable for individuals in high-risk occupations or those frequently engaged in hazardous activities, such as construction workers, pilots, or extreme sports enthusiasts. When purchasing such coverage, it is important to note that insurers may have strict definitions of "accidental death," typically excluding deaths caused by illness, suicide, or natural causes. Additionally, certain high-risk activities may be listed as exclusions, so policyholders should carefully review the terms.

* **重要性 / Significance**

  **English Explanation**: Accidental Death Benefits hold significant importance in the insurance industry by providing additional financial security to the insured's family, particularly in cases where the primary breadwinner dies unexpectedly. From a regulatory perspective, such policies must clearly define the scope of coverage to avoid disputes.
