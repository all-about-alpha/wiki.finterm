# Accrual Accounting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  权责发生制（Accrual Accounting）是一种会计方法，其核心概念是在经济业务发生时确认收入和费用，而不是在实际收到或支付现金时确认。这种方法由现代会计理论发展而来，强调收入与费用的匹配原则，确保财务报表反映企业真实的财务状况和经营成果。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accrual Accounting is an accounting method that recognizes revenues and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of when cash is actually received or paid. This approach, rooted in modern accounting theory, emphasizes the matching principle, ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect a company's true financial position and performance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  权责发生制广泛应用于企业财务报表编制中，特别是在收入确认和费用分摊方面。例如，企业在销售商品或提供服务时确认收入，即使款项尚未收到；同时，相关成本也在同一期间确认。需要注意的是，这种方法可能增加财务报告的复杂性，并可能引发收入确认过早或费用分摊不当的风险。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accrual Accounting is widely used in the preparation of corporate financial statements, particularly in revenue recognition and expense allocation. For instance, a company recognizes revenue when it sells goods or provides services, even if payment has not yet been received; simultaneously, related costs are recognized in the same period. It is important to note that this method may increase the complexity of financial reporting and could lead to risks such as premature revenue recognition or improper expense allocation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**  
  从监管角度看，权责发生制有助于提高财务信息的透明度和可比性，符合国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和中国会计准则的要求。从投资角度看，它能为投资者提供更准确的财务数据，支持决策分析。从行业角度看，权责发生制是企业管理层评估经营绩效和制定战略的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**  
  From a regulatory perspective, Accrual Accounting enhances the transparency and comparability of financial information, aligning with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Chinese Accounting Standards. From an investment standpoint, it provides investors with more accurate financial data to support decision-making. From an industry perspective, it serves as a critical tool for management to evaluate operational performance and formulate strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  权责发生制的概念可以追溯到中世纪欧洲的复式记账法，但其现代形式在20世纪初随着企业规模的扩大和财务报告的标准化而逐渐形成。20世纪30年代，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的成立和公认会计原则（GAAP）的制定进一步推动了权责发生制的普及。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The concept of Accrual Accounting can be traced back to the double-entry bookkeeping system in medieval Europe, but its modern form gradually took shape in the early 20th century with the expansion of corporate scale and the standardization of financial reporting. In the 1930s, the establishment of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the development of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) further promoted the widespread adoption of Accrual Accounting.
