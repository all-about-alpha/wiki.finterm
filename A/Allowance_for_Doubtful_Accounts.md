## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    坏账准备的概念起源于19世纪末的工业革命时期，随着信用销售的普及，企业开始面临应收账款无法收回的风险。早期的会计实践通过直接冲销坏账来处理这一问题，但这种方法无法准确反映企业的财务状况。20世纪初，随着会计原则的逐步完善，坏账准备作为一种更科学的会计处理方法被广泛采用。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts emerged during the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, as credit sales became more common and businesses faced the risk of uncollectible receivables. Early accounting practices addressed this by directly writing off bad debts, but this method failed to accurately reflect financial conditions. By the early 20th century, with the refinement of accounting principles, the allowance method was widely adopted as a more scientific approach.
