# Accountability

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：问责制（Accountability）是指个人或组织对其行为、决策和结果承担责任的制度或原则。它强调透明度和责任追究，确保行为主体对其行为后果负责。这一概念起源于公共管理和公司治理领域，核心在于通过监督和反馈机制，确保权力与责任的平衡。  
  **English Explanation**: Accountability refers to the principle or system where individuals or organizations are held responsible for their actions, decisions, and outcomes. It emphasizes transparency and the obligation to answer for the consequences of one's actions. Originating from public administration and corporate governance, its core lies in ensuring a balance between power and responsibility through oversight and feedback mechanisms.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：问责制广泛应用于政府、企业和非营利组织。例如，在政府中，官员需对其政策执行效果负责；在企业中，管理层需对股东和利益相关者负责；在非营利组织中，负责人需对捐赠者和受益人负责。风险在于，若问责机制不健全，可能导致权力滥用或责任推诿。  
  **English Application**: Accountability is widely applied in governments, corporations, and non-profit organizations. For instance, in governments, officials are accountable for policy outcomes; in corporations, management is accountable to shareholders and stakeholders; in non-profits, leaders are accountable to donors and beneficiaries. The risk lies in the potential for power abuse or evasion of responsibility if accountability mechanisms are weak.
