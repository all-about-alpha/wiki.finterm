# Actual Deferral & Actual Contribution Percentage Test (ADP/ACP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    实际延期百分比与实际贡献百分比测试（ADP/ACP）是美国《国内税收法》（Internal Revenue Code, IRC）中的一项规定，主要用于确保401(k)计划等员工退休福利计划的公平性。ADP测试衡量高收入员工与低收入员工在税前延期缴款（如401(k)计划中的税前贡献）上的差异，而ACP测试则针对税后贡献和雇主匹配贡献进行类似评估。这两项测试的目的是防止退休计划过度偏向高收入员工，确保计划的普惠性。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Actual Deferral Percentage & Actual Contribution Percentage Test (ADP/ACP) is a provision under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) designed to ensure fairness in employee retirement benefit plans, such as 401(k) plans. The ADP test measures the disparity in pre-tax deferrals (e.g., pre-tax contributions in a 401(k) plan) between highly compensated employees (HCEs) and non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). The ACP test similarly evaluates after-tax contributions and employer matching contributions. The purpose of these tests is to prevent retirement plans from disproportionately favoring high-income employees and to ensure the plan's inclusivity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    ADP/ACP测试主要应用于美国企业的401(k)计划或其他类似退休福利计划。企业在设计退休计划时，必须确保高收入员工与低收入员工的贡献比例符合IRS（美国国税局）的规定。如果测试未通过，企业可能需要调整计划或返还部分高收入员工的贡献，以避免税务处罚。风险包括计划设计不当导致的合规问题，以及未能通过测试可能引发的额外成本。  
  - **English Application**  
    The ADP/ACP tests are primarily applied to 401(k) plans or similar retirement benefit plans in U.S. companies. When designing retirement plans, employers must ensure that the contribution ratios between highly compensated employees (HCEs) and non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs) comply with IRS regulations. If the tests are not passed, the employer may need to adjust the plan or refund a portion of the contributions made by HCEs to avoid tax penalties. Risks include compliance issues due to improper plan design and potential additional costs if the tests are failed.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    ADP/ACP测试在退休计划管理中具有重要的监管意义。它确保了退休计划的公平性，防止高收入员工过度受益，同时保护低收入员工的权益。从投资和行业角度来看，通过ADP/ACP测试的企业能够避免税务风险，提升员工满意度，并增强企业的社会责任形象。  
  - **English Significance**  
    The ADP/ACP tests hold significant regulatory importance in retirement plan management. They ensure the fairness of retirement plans, preventing excessive benefits for highly compensated employees while protecting the rights of lower-income employees. From an investment and industry perspective, companies that pass the ADP/ACP tests can avoid tax risks, improve employee satisfaction, and enhance their corporate social responsibility image.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    ADP/ACP测试的起源可以追溯到1986年的《税收改革法案》（Tax Reform Act of 1986）。该法案引入了严格的非歧视测试要求，旨在解决退休计划中高收入员工与低收入员工之间的贡献不平衡问题。IRS随后制定了详细的规则，要求企业定期进行ADP/ACP测试，以确保计划的合规性。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The ADP/ACP tests originated from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which introduced stringent non-discrimination testing requirements to address the imbalance in contributions between highly compensated employees (HCEs) and non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs) in retirement plans. The IRS subsequently established detailed rules requiring companies to conduct ADP/ACP tests periodically to ensure plan compliance.

  - **English Impact**
