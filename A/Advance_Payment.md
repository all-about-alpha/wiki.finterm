# Advance Payment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  预付款（Advance Payment）是指在商品或服务交付之前，买方提前支付给卖方的一部分或全部款项。这种支付方式通常用于确保交易的顺利进行，尤其是在大额交易或长期合作中。预付款的核心概念在于提前支付以锁定交易，减少卖方风险，同时为买方争取更好的交易条件。  
  **English Explanation**  
  An advance payment refers to a partial or full payment made by the buyer to the seller before the delivery of goods or services. This payment method is commonly used to ensure the smooth execution of transactions, particularly in large-scale deals or long-term collaborations. The core concept of advance payment lies in securing the transaction by paying upfront, reducing the seller's risk, and potentially offering the buyer more favorable terms.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  预付款广泛应用于国际贸易、建筑工程、定制产品等领域。例如，在国际贸易中，买方可能需要在货物装运前支付一定比例的预付款，以确保卖方有足够的资金进行生产或采购。然而，预付款也存在一定风险，如卖方未能按时交货或交付的产品不符合约定，可能导致买方资金损失。因此，合同中通常会对预付款的条件、比例和违约责任进行详细规定。  
  **English Application**  
  Advance payments are widely used in international trade, construction projects, and custom-made products. For instance, in international trade, buyers may need to pay a certain percentage of the total amount as an advance before the goods are shipped to ensure the seller has sufficient funds for production or procurement. However, advance payments also carry risks, such as the seller failing to deliver on time or providing goods that do not meet the agreed specifications, potentially leading to financial losses for the buyer. Therefore, contracts typically specify the conditions, proportions, and liabilities related to advance payments.
