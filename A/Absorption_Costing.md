# Absorption Costing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：吸收成本法（Absorption Costing）是一种将所有生产成本（包括固定成本和变动成本）都分配到产品中的成本计算方法。这种方法由美国会计学界在20世纪初提出，核心概念是将直接材料、直接人工、变动制造费用和固定制造费用全部计入产品成本。  
  **English Explanation**: Absorption costing is a cost accounting method that allocates all manufacturing costs, including both fixed and variable costs, to the products. This method was introduced by the American accounting academia in the early 20th century, with the core concept of including direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead in the product cost.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：吸收成本法广泛应用于制造业，特别是在需要对外报告财务报表时。它适用于需要全面反映生产成本的企业，但在短期内可能掩盖固定成本对利润的影响，因此在使用时需注意其局限性。  
  **English Explanation**: Absorption costing is widely used in manufacturing, especially when external financial reporting is required. It is suitable for businesses that need to fully reflect production costs, but it may obscure the impact of fixed costs on profits in the short term, so its limitations should be noted when applied.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，吸收成本法是符合国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和美国通用会计准则（GAAP）的合法成本计算方法。从投资和行业角度看，它有助于企业更全面地评估产品盈利能力，但也可能因固定成本分配问题导致决策偏差。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, absorption costing is a legitimate cost accounting method compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). From an investment and industry perspective, it helps businesses more comprehensively assess product profitability, but may also lead to decision-making biases due to fixed cost allocation issues.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：吸收成本法的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的美国工业革命时期。随着大规模生产的兴起，企业需要一种系统的方法来分配生产成本。1920年代，会计学家开始提出将固定成本纳入产品成本计算的理论，并在1930年代逐渐形成完整的吸收成本法体系。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of absorption costing dates back to the early 20th century during the American Industrial Revolution. With the rise of mass production, businesses needed a systematic method to allocate production costs. In the 1920s, accountants began proposing theories to include fixed costs in product cost calculations, and by the 1930s, a complete absorption costing system had been developed.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：吸收成本法对制造业的成本管理产生了深远影响，成为企业财务报告的标准方法之一。然而，随着管理会计的发展，其局限性也逐渐显现，特别是在短期决策和成本控制方面。目前，吸收成本法仍广泛应用于全球制造业，但常与其他成本计算方法结合使用。  
  **English Explanation**: Absorption costing has had a profound impact on cost management in manufacturing, becoming one of the standard methods for corporate financial reporting. However, with the development of management accounting, its limitations have become apparent, particularly in short-term decision-making and cost control. Currently, absorption costing is still widely used in global manufacturing but is often combined with other cost accounting methods.
