# Annuity Due

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  期初年金（Annuity Due）是一种年金支付方式，指的是在每期期初（而非期末）进行支付的年金。与普通年金（Ordinary Annuity）不同，期初年金的支付时间提前了一个周期，因此其现值和终值的计算方式也有所不同。期初年金常用于租赁、保险和退休金计划等场景。  
  **核心概念**：期初支付、现值计算、终值计算、时间价值。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  An annuity due is a type of annuity where payments are made at the beginning of each period, rather than at the end. Unlike an ordinary annuity, the timing of payments in an annuity due is advanced by one period, which affects the calculation of its present value and future value. Annuity due is commonly used in leasing, insurance, and retirement planning.  
  **Core Concepts**: Beginning-of-period payments, present value calculation, future value calculation, time value of money.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  期初年金广泛应用于租赁合同、保险保费支付、退休金计划等场景。例如，在租赁合同中，租户通常需要在每期期初支付租金；在退休金计划中，退休人员可能在每月初领取养老金。需要注意的是，由于支付时间提前，期初年金的现值通常高于普通年金，投资者需根据自身现金流需求选择合适的年金类型。  
  **风险提示**：期初年金可能增加短期现金流压力，需确保支付能力。  

  **English Application Scenarios**:  
  Annuity due is widely used in leasing contracts, insurance premium payments, and retirement plans. For example, in leasing agreements, tenants typically pay rent at the beginning of each period; in retirement plans, retirees may receive pensions at the start of each month. It is important to note that the present value of an annuity due is generally higher than that of an ordinary annuity due to the earlier payment timing. Investors should choose the appropriate annuity type based on their cash flow needs.  
  **Risk Notes**: Annuity due may increase short-term cash flow pressure, so payment capacity should be ensured.
