# Accretion of Discount

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  折价累积（Accretion of Discount）是指债券或其他金融工具以低于面值的价格购买后，随着时间的推移，其账面价值逐渐增加至面值的过程。这一过程通常发生在零息债券或折价债券中，反映了投资者在持有期间逐步实现的利息收益。折价累积的核心概念是通过摊销折价部分，将债券的账面价值调整至到期时的面值。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Accretion of Discount refers to the gradual increase in the book value of a bond or other financial instrument purchased at a price below its face value, as it approaches maturity. This process typically occurs with zero-coupon bonds or discounted bonds, reflecting the investor's gradual realization of interest income over the holding period. The core concept involves amortizing the discount to adjust the bond's book value to its face value at maturity.
