# Accrued Liability

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：应计负债（Accrued Liability）是指企业在会计期间内已经发生但尚未支付的费用或义务。这些负债通常是由于时间差异导致的，例如员工工资、利息费用或税款等。应计负债是企业财务报表中的重要组成部分，反映了企业在特定时点的财务义务。  
  **English Explanation**: Accrued Liability refers to expenses or obligations that a company has incurred during an accounting period but has not yet paid. These liabilities typically arise due to timing differences, such as employee wages, interest expenses, or taxes. Accrued liabilities are a crucial part of a company's financial statements, reflecting its financial obligations at a specific point in time.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：应计负债常见于企业的工资发放、利息计提和税款缴纳等场景。例如，企业在月末尚未支付员工工资时，需在财务报表中计提应计工资负债。风险方面，若企业未能准确计提应计负债，可能导致财务报表失真，影响投资者和监管机构的判断。  
  **English Application**: Accrued liabilities are commonly seen in scenarios such as payroll, interest accruals, and tax payments. For instance, if a company has not paid employee wages by the end of the month, it must record an accrued wage liability in its financial statements. Risks include potential misstatements in financial reports if accrued liabilities are not accurately recorded, which could mislead investors and regulators.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，应计负债的准确计提是财务透明度的体现，有助于监管机构评估企业的财务健康状况。从投资角度看，应计负债反映了企业的短期财务压力，是投资者分析企业偿债能力的重要指标。从行业角度看，应计负债的管理水平直接关系到企业的财务稳健性。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, accurate recording of accrued liabilities reflects financial transparency and helps regulators assess a company's financial health. From an investment standpoint, accrued liabilities indicate short-term financial pressures and are a key metric for analyzing a company's solvency. From an industry perspective, the management of accrued liabilities directly impacts a company's financial stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：应计负债的概念起源于复式记账法的广泛应用。15世纪，意大利数学家卢卡·帕乔利（Luca Pacioli）在其著作《算术、几何、比与比例概要》中首次系统阐述了复式记账法，为应计负债的会计处理奠定了基础。随着现代企业制度的建立，应计负债逐渐成为财务报表中的标准项目。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of accrued liabilities originated with the widespread adoption of double-entry bookkeeping. In the 15th century, Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli systematically explained double-entry bookkeeping in his work "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita," laying the foundation for the accounting treatment of accrued liabilities. With the establishment of modern corporate systems, accrued liabilities gradually became a standard item in financial statements.
