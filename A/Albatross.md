## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    “Albatross”一词的金融隐喻源自英国诗人塞缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治（Samuel Taylor Coleridge）的叙事诗《古舟子咏》（The Rime of the Ancient Mariner）。诗中，水手射杀了一只象征好运的信天翁，结果招致厄运，信天翁被挂在船员的脖子上作为惩罚。这一意象后来被引申为无法摆脱的负担。20世纪后期，金融界开始借用这一文学意象，形容那些拖累企业发展的资产或负债。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The financial metaphor of "Albatross" originates from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's narrative poem *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner*. In the poem, a sailor kills an albatross, a symbol of good luck, and brings misfortune upon himself, with the albatross hung around his neck as punishment. This imagery was later extended to represent an inescapable burden. In the late 20th century, the financial world adopted this literary metaphor to describe assets or liabilities that hinder a company's growth.
