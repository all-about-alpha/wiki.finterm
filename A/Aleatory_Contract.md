## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

  射幸合同（Aleatory Contract）是一种双方权利义务取决于未来不确定事件的合同。其核心特点是合同的结果依赖于偶然事件的发生，而非双方的控制。常见的射幸合同包括保险合同、赌博合同和某些金融衍生品合同。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  An aleatory contract is a type of contract where the obligations of the parties depend on the occurrence of an uncertain future event.

* **应用 / Application**

  射幸合同广泛应用于保险行业，如人寿保险、财产保险等。投保人支付保费，而保险公司在特定事件（如事故、疾病或死亡）发生时支付赔偿。此外，射幸合同也见于赌博和金融衍生品市场，如期权和期货合约。需要注意的是，射幸合同具有高风险性，因为其结果完全依赖于不可控的偶然事件。  
  **English Application**：  
  Aleatory contracts are widely used in the insurance industry, such as life insurance and property insurance. The policyholder pays premiums, and the insurer pays out in the event of a specific occurrence (e.g., accident, illness, or death). Additionally, aleatory contracts are found in gambling and financial derivatives markets, such as options and futures contracts. It is important to note that aleatory contracts carry high risk, as their outcomes depend entirely on uncontrollable chance events.
