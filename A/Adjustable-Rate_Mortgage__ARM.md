# Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    可调利率抵押贷款（Adjustable-Rate Mortgage, ARM）是一种利率根据市场条件定期调整的住房贷款。其初始利率通常低于固定利率抵押贷款，但之后会根据特定的基准利率（如LIBOR或美国国债利率）加上一个固定的利差进行调整。调整频率和幅度通常在贷款合同中明确规定。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    An Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM) is a type of home loan where the interest rate periodically adjusts based on market conditions. The initial interest rate is typically lower than that of a fixed-rate mortgage, but it subsequently adjusts based on a specific benchmark rate (such as LIBOR or U.S. Treasury rates) plus a fixed margin. The frequency and extent of adjustments are usually specified in the loan agreement.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    ARM适用于那些预计未来收入会增加或计划在利率调整前出售房产的借款人。由于初始利率较低，ARM可以帮助借款人在贷款初期节省利息支出。然而，借款人需注意利率上升的风险，因为未来的还款金额可能会大幅增加。  
  - **English Application**  
    ARMs are suitable for borrowers who expect their income to increase in the future or plan to sell the property before the rate adjusts. Due to the lower initial interest rate, ARMs can help borrowers save on interest payments in the early stages of the loan. However, borrowers should be aware of the risk of rising interest rates, as future payments could significantly increase.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，ARM的透明度和风险披露对保护消费者至关重要。从投资角度看，ARM为银行和投资者提供了利率风险管理的工具。从行业角度看，ARM的灵活性有助于满足不同借款人的需求，促进房地产市场的流动性。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, transparency and risk disclosure in ARMs are crucial for consumer protection. From an investment standpoint, ARMs provide banks and investors with tools for interest rate risk management. From an industry perspective, the flexibility of ARMs helps meet the diverse needs of borrowers and promotes liquidity in the real estate market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    可调利率抵押贷款起源于20世纪70年代的美国，当时高通胀和利率波动使得固定利率贷款难以管理。1981年，美国国会通过《存款机构放松管制和货币控制法》，正式允许银行提供ARM产品。这一创新使得贷款机构能够更好地应对利率风险。  
  - **English Origin**  
    Adjustable-Rate Mortgages originated in the United States in the 1970s, during a period of high inflation and interest rate volatility that made fixed-rate loans difficult to manage. In 1981, the U.S. Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, officially allowing banks to offer ARM products. This innovation enabled lenders to better manage interest rate risk.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**  
    ARM的推出改变了住房贷款市场的格局，为借款人提供了更多选择，同时也增加了市场的复杂性。2008年金融危机期间，部分ARM产品的设计缺陷和风险控制不足被认为是导致次贷危机的原因之一。此后，监管机构加强了对ARM的审查和规范。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The introduction of ARMs transformed the housing loan market, offering borrowers more options while also increasing market complexity. During the 2008 financial crisis, design flaws and inadequate risk controls in some ARM products were considered contributing factors to the subprime mortgage crisis. Since then, regulatory bodies have strengthened oversight and regulation of ARMs.
