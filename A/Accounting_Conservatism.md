# Accounting Conservatism

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：会计稳健性（Accounting Conservatism）是一种会计原则，强调在财务报表中应谨慎确认收入和资产，同时及时确认费用和负债。其核心概念是“宁可低估资产和收入，也不高估”，以确保财务信息的可靠性和稳健性。这一原则最早由会计学者提出，旨在应对不确定性带来的财务风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Accounting conservatism is an accounting principle that emphasizes the cautious recognition of revenues and assets, while promptly recognizing expenses and liabilities in financial statements. Its core concept is "better to understate assets and revenues than to overstate them," ensuring the reliability and prudence of financial information. This principle was initially proposed by accounting scholars to address financial risks arising from uncertainty.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：会计稳健性广泛应用于企业财务报表编制中，尤其是在收入确认、资产减值测试和或有负债处理等方面。例如，企业在确认收入时，需确保收入已实际实现且可计量；在资产减值测试中，需及时反映资产价值的下降。然而，过度稳健可能导致财务信息失真，影响投资者决策。  
  **English Explanation**: Accounting conservatism is widely applied in the preparation of corporate financial statements, particularly in revenue recognition, asset impairment testing, and contingent liability treatment. For example, when recognizing revenue, companies must ensure that the revenue is actually realized and measurable; in asset impairment testing, they must promptly reflect declines in asset value. However, excessive conservatism may lead to distorted financial information, affecting investor decisions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，会计稳健性有助于防止企业虚增利润和资产，保护投资者利益；从投资角度看，稳健的财务信息能降低投资风险，增强市场信心；从行业角度看，它促进了财务透明度和可比性，推动了资本市场的健康发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, accounting conservatism helps prevent companies from inflating profits and assets, protecting investor interests. From an investment perspective, conservative financial information reduces investment risks and enhances market confidence. From an industry perspective, it promotes financial transparency and comparability, fostering the healthy development of capital markets.
