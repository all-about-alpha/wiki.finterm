# Amortized Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：摊销债券（Amortized Bond）是一种在债券存续期内，发行人按照一定的时间表逐步偿还本金的债券。与传统的到期一次性还本付息的债券不同，摊销债券的本金会随着时间推移逐渐减少，通常通过定期支付本金和利息的方式实现。这种债券的核心概念在于“摊销”，即本金的逐步偿还。  
  **English Explanation**: An amortized bond is a type of bond where the issuer repays the principal gradually over the life of the bond according to a predetermined schedule. Unlike traditional bonds that repay the principal in a lump sum at maturity, the principal of an amortized bond decreases over time, typically through regular payments that include both principal and interest. The core concept here is "amortization," which refers to the gradual repayment of the principal.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：摊销债券常用于住房抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）和汽车贷款支持证券（ABS）等资产支持证券中。投资者可以通过购买摊销债券获得稳定的现金流，但需注意利率风险和提前还款风险。如果市场利率上升，债券的市场价值可能下降；如果借款人提前还款，投资者的收益可能受到影响。  
  **English Application**: Amortized bonds are commonly used in asset-backed securities (ABS) such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and auto loan-backed securities. Investors can obtain stable cash flows by purchasing amortized bonds, but they need to be aware of interest rate risk and prepayment risk. If market interest rates rise, the market value of the bond may decline; if borrowers prepay, the investor's returns may be affected.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，摊销债券有助于分散风险，降低金融机构的资产负债压力。从投资角度看，摊销债券为投资者提供了多样化的投资选择，尤其是在低利率环境下，能够提供相对稳定的收益。从行业角度看，摊销债券的广泛应用推动了资产证券化市场的发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, amortized bonds help diversify risks and reduce the asset-liability pressure on financial institutions. From an investment perspective, they offer diversified investment options, especially in low-interest-rate environments, providing relatively stable returns. From an industry perspective, the widespread use of amortized bonds has driven the development of the asset securitization market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：摊销债券的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪初的美国，当时金融机构开始尝试将抵押贷款打包成证券出售。20世纪70年代，随着住房抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）的兴起，摊销债券逐渐成为金融市场的重要组成部分。这一创新由美国政府国民抵押贷款协会（GNMA）推动，旨在提高住房贷款的流动性。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of amortized bonds can be traced back to the early 20th century in the United States, when financial institutions began experimenting with packaging mortgages into securities. In the 1970s, with the rise of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), amortized bonds gradually became an important part of the financial market. This innovation was driven by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) to enhance the liquidity of housing loans.

* **影响 / Impact**
