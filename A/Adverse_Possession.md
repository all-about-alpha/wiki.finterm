# Adverse Possession

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  逆权侵占（Adverse Possession）是指非所有权人在未经原所有权人许可的情况下，通过长期、公开、持续且排他性地占有他人不动产，最终可能获得该不动产所有权的法律制度。这一概念起源于普通法，核心在于通过占有行为取代原所有权人的权利。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Adverse Possession refers to a legal doctrine where a person who is not the original owner of a property can acquire ownership rights by occupying the property openly, continuously, exclusively, and without the owner's permission for a specified period of time. This concept originates from common law and is based on the idea that possession can override the original owner's rights.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  逆权侵占通常适用于土地或房产纠纷，例如某人长期占用他人闲置土地并加以利用（如耕种、建造房屋等），且原所有权人未采取法律行动。在中国，虽然法律未明确承认逆权侵占，但在某些案例中，法院可能参考类似原则处理长期占有的纠纷。需要注意的是，这种行为存在法律风险，可能引发诉讼。  
  **English Application**  
  Adverse Possession is commonly applied in disputes over land or real estate, such as when someone occupies and uses another person's unused land (e.g., farming, building structures) for an extended period without the owner's objection. In jurisdictions where this doctrine is recognized, courts may grant ownership to the occupier if all legal requirements are met. However, this practice carries legal risks and may lead to litigation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从法律和投资角度看，逆权侵占制度旨在促进土地资源的有效利用，防止土地长期闲置。然而，它也提醒不动产所有者需定期检查和管理其财产，以避免权利被侵蚀。在行业层面，这一制度可能影响土地交易和产权保险的设计。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a legal and investment perspective, Adverse Possession encourages the efficient use of land resources by preventing long-term neglect. However, it also serves as a reminder for property owners to regularly monitor and manage their assets to avoid losing rights. At the industry level, this doctrine can influence land transactions and the design of title insurance.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  逆权侵占的概念可追溯至中世纪的英国普通法，当时土地所有权记录不完善，法律通过承认长期占有者的权利来解决土地纠纷。这一制度后来被许多普通法系国家（如美国、加拿大）采纳，并逐步发展完善。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of Adverse Possession dates back to medieval English common law, where land ownership records were often incomplete. The law recognized the rights of long-term occupiers to resolve land disputes. This doctrine was later adopted by many common law jurisdictions, such as the United States and Canada, and has evolved over time.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  逆权侵占制度在全球范围内对土地管理和产权保护产生了深远影响。在一些国家，它被用于解决历史遗留的土地纠纷；而在另一些国家，则被视为对私有财产权的潜在威胁。目前，许多国家已通过立法限制或修改这一制度。  
  **English Impact**  
  The doctrine of Adverse Possession has had a profound impact on land management and property rights protection worldwide. In some countries, it has been used to resolve historical land disputes, while in others, it is seen as a potential threat to private property rights. Today, many countries have enacted laws to limit or modify this doctrine.
