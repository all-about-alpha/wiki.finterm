# Autonomous Expenditure

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：自主支出（Autonomous Expenditure）是指在经济模型中，不依赖于当前收入水平或经济状况的支出部分。这类支出通常由外部因素驱动，如政府政策、企业投资决策或消费者信心等。自主支出是宏观经济分析中的一个关键概念，尤其在凯恩斯经济学中，它被视为总需求的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: Autonomous Expenditure refers to the portion of spending in an economic model that is independent of the current level of income or economic conditions. This type of expenditure is typically driven by external factors such as government policies, corporate investment decisions, or consumer confidence. It is a key concept in macroeconomic analysis, particularly in Keynesian economics, where it is considered a critical component of aggregate demand.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：自主支出在宏观经济政策制定中具有重要应用。例如，政府通过增加公共支出或减税来刺激经济时，这些措施被视为自主支出的增加。此外，企业在经济不确定性较高时仍进行的投资也属于自主支出。需要注意的是，自主支出的波动可能对经济稳定性产生影响，尤其是在经济衰退或过热时期。  
  **English Application**: Autonomous Expenditure plays a significant role in macroeconomic policy formulation. For instance, when a government increases public spending or cuts taxes to stimulate the economy, these measures are considered increases in autonomous expenditure. Similarly, investments made by businesses during periods of high economic uncertainty also fall under this category. It is important to note that fluctuations in autonomous expenditure can impact economic stability, particularly during recessions or periods of overheating.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，自主支出是评估经济健康状况的重要指标。它直接影响总需求，进而影响经济增长、就业水平和通货膨胀。对于投资者而言，理解自主支出的变化有助于预测经济周期和制定投资策略。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, autonomous expenditure is a crucial indicator for assessing economic health. It directly influences aggregate demand, thereby affecting economic growth, employment levels, and inflation. For investors, understanding changes in autonomous expenditure helps in forecasting economic cycles and formulating investment strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：自主支出的概念最早由英国经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在其1936年出版的《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出。凯恩斯认为，在经济衰退期间，私人部门的支出（如消费和投资）可能不足以维持充分就业，因此需要政府通过增加自主支出来填补这一缺口。这一理论为现代宏观经济政策奠定了基础。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of autonomous expenditure was first introduced by British economist John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 book, *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*. Keynes argued that during economic downturns, private sector spending (such as consumption and investment) might be insufficient to maintain full employment, necessitating government intervention through increased autonomous expenditure. This theory laid the foundation for modern macroeconomic policy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：自主支出理论对全球经济政策产生了深远影响。特别是在20世纪中叶，许多国家采用凯恩斯主义政策，通过增加政府支出来应对经济衰退。如今，自主支出仍然是各国政府应对经济危机的重要工具。例如，2008年全球金融危机期间，多国政府通过大规模财政刺激计划增加了自主支出，以稳定经济。  
  **English Impact**: The theory of autonomous expenditure has had a profound impact on global economic policies. Particularly in the mid-20th century, many countries adopted Keynesian policies, using increased government spending to combat economic recessions. Today, autonomous expenditure remains a vital tool for governments in addressing economic crises. For example, during the 2008 global financial crisis, numerous governments implemented large-scale fiscal stimulus packages to increase autonomous expenditure and stabilize their economies.
