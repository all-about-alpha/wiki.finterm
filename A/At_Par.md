# At Par

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “At Par” 是一个金融术语，指的是证券（如债券或股票）以其面值（即票面价值）进行交易或发行。面值是指证券在发行时设定的名义价值，通常印在证券的票面上。当证券以面值交易时，意味着其市场价格与面值相等。这一概念最早起源于债券市场，用于描述债券的发行和交易价格与其票面价值一致的情况。  
  **核心概念**：面值、市场价格、债券、股票。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  "At Par" is a financial term that refers to a security (such as a bond or stock) being traded or issued at its face value (also known as par value). Face value is the nominal value assigned to a security at the time of issuance, typically printed on the security itself. When a security is traded at par, it means its market price is equal to its face value. This concept originated in the bond market, describing situations where bonds are issued or traded at their face value.  
  **Core Concepts**: Face value, market price, bonds, stocks.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  “At Par” 常用于债券市场，尤其是新发行的债券。例如，当一家公司发行债券时，如果债券以面值发行，投资者支付的金额与债券的票面价值相同。此外，在二级市场中，债券的价格可能因市场利率变化而波动，但若债券以面值交易，则表明其收益率与市场利率一致。  
  **风险提示**：若市场利率上升，债券价格可能下跌至低于面值（折价交易）；反之，若市场利率下降，债券价格可能上涨至高于面值（溢价交易）。  

  **English Application**:  
  "At Par" is commonly used in the bond market, particularly for newly issued bonds. For example, when a company issues bonds, if the bonds are issued at par, investors pay an amount equal to the bond's face value. Additionally, in the secondary market, bond prices may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates, but if a bond is trading at par, it indicates that its yield aligns with the market rate.  
  **Risk Note**: If market interest rates rise, bond prices may fall below par (trading at a discount); conversely, if market interest rates fall, bond prices may rise above par (trading at a premium).

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文意义**：  
  从监管角度看，“At Par” 是衡量债券发行是否合规的重要指标之一。从投资角度看，以面值交易的债券通常被视为风险较低，因为其价格与市场利率一致。从行业角度看，这一概念有助于投资者理解债券定价机制，并为发行人提供融资成本的参考。  

  **English Significance**:  
  From a regulatory perspective, "At Par" is an important indicator of whether bond issuance complies with regulations. From an investment perspective, bonds trading at par are generally considered lower risk because their price aligns with market interest rates. From an industry perspective, this concept helps investors understand bond pricing mechanisms and provides issuers with a reference for financing costs.
