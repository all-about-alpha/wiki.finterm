# Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：调整后运营资金（AFFO）是房地产投资信托（REITs）和其他房地产相关公司使用的一种财务指标，用于衡量公司在扣除资本支出后的实际现金流。AFFO在运营资金（FFO）的基础上进一步调整，考虑了维护性资本支出、租赁成本和债务偿还等因素，以更准确地反映公司的可持续现金流。  
  - **English Explanation**: Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) is a financial metric used by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other real estate-related companies to measure the actual cash flow after deducting capital expenditures. AFFO builds upon Funds From Operations (FFO) by further adjusting for maintenance capital expenditures, leasing costs, and debt repayments, providing a more accurate reflection of the company's sustainable cash flow.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：AFFO主要用于评估REITs的现金流能力和分红可持续性。投资者和分析师通过AFFO来判断公司是否有足够的现金流支持其分红政策，尤其是在房地产行业波动较大的情况下。需要注意的是，AFFO的计算方法可能因公司而异，投资者应仔细阅读财务报表中的注释。  
  - **English Application**: AFFO is primarily used to assess the cash flow capability and dividend sustainability of REITs. Investors and analysts use AFFO to determine whether a company has sufficient cash flow to support its dividend policy, especially in the volatile real estate industry. It is important to note that the calculation of AFFO may vary by company, and investors should carefully review the notes in financial statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**

Regulatory bodies also encourage the use of AFFO as it more accurately reflects a company's operational efficiency and dividend-paying capability.
