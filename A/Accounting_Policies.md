## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**

  会计政策的起源可以追溯到20世纪初，随着工业革命和企业规模的扩大，财务报表的编制逐渐规范化。1929年全球经济大萧条后，各国开始重视会计准则的制定，会计政策作为其中的核心内容逐步形成。1973年，国际会计准则委员会（IASC）成立，推动了会计政策的国际统一化。  
  **English Origin**  
  The origin of accounting policies can be traced back to the early 20th century, as the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of enterprise scale led to the gradual standardization of financial statement preparation. After the global economic depression of 1929, countries began to emphasize the formulation of accounting standards, and accounting policies gradually emerged as a core component. In 1973, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was established, promoting the international harmonization of accounting policies.
