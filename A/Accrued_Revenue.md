  应计收入（Accrued Revenue）是指企业在会计期间内已经赚取但尚未实际收到现金的收入。根据权责发生制原则，即使款项尚未到账，只要收入已经实现，就应在财务报表中确认。核心概念包括收入确认原则和权责发生制。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accrued Revenue refers to income that a company has earned during an accounting period but has not yet received in cash.

In these scenarios, a company may recognize revenue after completing a portion of the service or project phase, even if the client has not yet made payment. It is important to note that recognizing accrued revenue may increase accounts receivable, posing a risk of bad debt.
