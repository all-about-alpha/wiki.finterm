# Auditor's Opinion

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：审计意见（Auditor's Opinion）是指注册会计师或审计师在完成财务报表审计后，对财务报表是否在所有重大方面按照适用的财务报告框架（如企业会计准则）公允反映被审计单位的财务状况、经营成果和现金流量所发表的书面意见。审计意见是审计报告的核心部分，通常分为无保留意见、保留意见、否定意见和无法表示意见四种类型。  
  **English Explanation**: An Auditor's Opinion is a formal statement issued by a certified public accountant or auditor after completing an audit of financial statements. It expresses the auditor's professional judgment on whether the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the entity in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework (e.g., Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). The opinion is a key component of the audit report and typically falls into one of four categories: unqualified, qualified, adverse, or disclaimer of opinion.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：审计意见广泛应用于企业年度财务报表审计、上市公司信息披露、银行贷款审批、投资者决策等场景。例如，上市公司在发布年度报告时，必须附上审计师出具的审计意见，以增强财务报表的可信度。投资者和债权人依赖审计意见评估企业的财务健康状况。需要注意的是，审计意见仅提供合理保证，而非绝对保证，且受限于审计范围和审计师的职业判断。  
  **English Application**: The Auditor's Opinion is widely used in scenarios such as annual financial statement audits, public company disclosures, bank loan approvals, and investor decision-making. For instance, public companies must include an auditor's opinion in their annual reports to enhance the credibility of their financial statements. Investors and creditors rely on the opinion to assess a company's financial health. It is important to note that an auditor's opinion provides reasonable assurance, not absolute certainty, and is subject to the scope of the audit and the auditor's professional judgment.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：审计意见的起源可以追溯到19世纪末20世纪初，随着工业革命和资本市场的兴起，企业规模扩大，所有权与经营权分离，外部投资者对财务信息的需求增加。1929年全球经济大萧条后，美国颁布了《证券法》（1933年）和《证券交易法》（1934年），首次要求上市公司提供经审计的财务报表，审计意见作为审计报告的核心内容逐渐制度化。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of the Auditor's Opinion dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capital markets. As businesses grew and ownership separated from management, external investors demanded more reliable financial information. Following the Great Depression of 1929, the U.S. enacted the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, mandating that public companies provide audited financial statements. The Auditor's Opinion, as a core component of the audit report, became institutionalized.
