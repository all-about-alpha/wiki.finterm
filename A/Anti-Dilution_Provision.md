# Anti-Dilution Provision

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：反稀释条款（Anti-Dilution Provision）是一种在股权融资协议中常见的保护性条款，主要用于保护早期投资者在公司后续融资中因股份被稀释而遭受的损失。该条款通常在公司发行新股或进行股权融资时触发，确保早期投资者的持股比例或价值不会因新股的发行而大幅减少。核心概念包括“完全棘轮”（Full Ratchet）和“加权平均”（Weighted Average）两种调整方式。  
  **English Explanation**: An Anti-Dilution Provision is a protective clause commonly found in equity financing agreements, designed to safeguard early investors from losses due to share dilution in subsequent financing rounds. This provision is typically triggered when a company issues new shares or conducts equity financing, ensuring that the ownership percentage or value of early investors is not significantly reduced by the issuance of new shares. Key concepts include "Full Ratchet" and "Weighted Average" adjustment methods.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：反稀释条款广泛应用于风险投资（VC）和私募股权（PE）领域，尤其是在初创企业的融资过程中。当公司进行低价融资（即新股的发行价格低于早期投资者的购买价格）时，反稀释条款会启动，调整早期投资者的持股比例或转换价格，以补偿其损失。需要注意的是，反稀释条款可能会对公司的后续融资产生不利影响，因为潜在投资者可能会担心其权益被稀释。  
  **English Application**: Anti-Dilution Provisions are widely used in venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) sectors, particularly in the financing of startups. When a company conducts a down round (i.e., issuing new shares at a price lower than the purchase price of early investors), the Anti-Dilution Provision is triggered to adjust the ownership percentage or conversion price of early investors to compensate for their losses. It is important to note that Anti-Dilution Provisions may negatively impact subsequent financing, as potential investors may be concerned about their equity being diluted.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，反稀释条款在保护投资者权益、维护市场公平性方面具有重要意义。对于早期投资者而言，该条款能够有效降低投资风险，增强投资信心；对于公司而言，合理设置反稀释条款有助于吸引更多投资者，但过度保护早期投资者可能会限制公司的融资灵活性。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Anti-Dilution Provisions play a crucial role in protecting investor rights and maintaining market fairness. For early investors, this provision effectively reduces investment risk and enhances confidence; for companies, setting reasonable Anti-Dilution Provisions can help attract more investors, but excessive protection of early investors may limit the company's financing flexibility.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：反稀释条款的起源可以追溯到20世纪中期的美国风险投资市场。随着初创企业融资活动的增多，早期投资者面临股份被稀释的风险逐渐显现。为了保护投资者利益，反稀释条款被引入融资协议中，并逐渐成为风险投资领域的标准条款。20世纪80年代，随着科技创业浪潮的兴起，反稀释条款的应用进一步普及。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of Anti-Dilution Provisions can be traced back to the U.S. venture capital market in the mid-20th century. As financing activities for startups increased, the risk of share dilution for early investors became more apparent. To protect investor interests, Anti-Dilution Provisions were introduced into financing agreements and gradually became a standard clause in the venture capital sector. In the 1980s, with the rise of the tech startup wave, the application of Anti-Dilution Provisions became even more widespread.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：反稀释条款对全球风险投资和私募股权市场产生了深远影响。它不仅保护了早期投资者的利益，还促进了初创企业的融资活动。然而，过度依赖反稀释条款可能导致公司估值虚高，增加后续融资的难度。目前，反稀释条款已成为全球股权投资协议中的重要组成部分，尤其在科技和生物医药等高成长性行业中广泛应用。  
  **English Impact**: Anti-Dilution Provisions have had a profound impact on the global venture capital and private equity markets. They not only protect the interests of early investors but also facilitate financing activities for startups. However, over-reliance on Anti-Dilution Provisions may lead to inflated company valuations and increase the difficulty of subsequent financing. Currently, Anti-Dilution Provisions have become an essential component of global equity investment agreements, especially in high-growth industries such as technology and biopharmaceuticals.
