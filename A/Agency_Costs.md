# Agency Costs

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：代理成本（Agency Costs）是指由于公司所有者（股东）与管理者（代理人）之间的利益不一致而产生的成本。这一概念由经济学家迈克尔·詹森（Michael Jensen）和威廉·梅克林（William Meckling）于1976年提出，核心在于描述委托-代理关系中因信息不对称和目标冲突导致的效率损失。代理成本通常包括监督成本、约束成本和剩余损失。  
  **English Explanation**: Agency Costs refer to the costs incurred due to the misalignment of interests between the owners (shareholders) and the managers (agents) of a company. This concept was introduced by economists Michael Jensen and William Meckling in 1976, focusing on the inefficiencies arising from information asymmetry and goal conflicts in principal-agent relationships. Agency costs typically include monitoring costs, bonding costs, and residual loss.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：代理成本在企业管理中广泛存在，尤其是在股权分散的上市公司中。例如，管理者可能为了个人利益而进行过度投资或规避风险，损害股东利益。为降低代理成本，企业常采取股权激励、董事会监督或外部审计等措施。然而，这些措施本身也可能产生额外成本，需权衡利弊。  
  **English Explanation**: Agency costs are prevalent in corporate management, especially in publicly traded companies with dispersed ownership. For instance, managers might over-invest or avoid risks for personal gain, harming shareholders' interests. To mitigate agency costs, companies often adopt measures such as equity incentives, board oversight, or external audits. However, these measures may also incur additional costs, requiring a balance between benefits and expenses.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，代理成本是公司治理的核心问题之一，直接影响企业效率和市场公平性。从投资角度看，理解代理成本有助于评估公司管理质量和潜在风险。从行业角度看，降低代理成本是提升企业竞争力和长期价值的关键。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, agency costs are a central issue in corporate governance, directly impacting corporate efficiency and market fairness. From an investment perspective, understanding agency costs helps assess management quality and potential risks. From an industry perspective, reducing agency costs is crucial for enhancing corporate competitiveness and long-term value.
