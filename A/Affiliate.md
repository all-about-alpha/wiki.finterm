## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    附属公司（Affiliate）是指由另一家公司（母公司）通过持股或协议控制的企业实体。通常，母公司持有附属公司一定比例的股份（通常低于50%），但不完全拥有其控制权。附属公司在法律上是独立的法人实体，但在经营上受到母公司的重大影响。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    An affiliate is a business entity controlled by another company (the parent company) through shareholding or contractual agreements. Typically, the parent company holds a certain percentage of the affiliate's shares (usually less than 50%) but does not have full control. Affiliates are legally independent entities but are significantly influenced by the parent company in their operations.
