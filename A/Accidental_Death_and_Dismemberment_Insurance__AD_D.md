  意外死亡及伤残保险（AD&D）是一种保险产品，旨在为被保险人在因意外事故导致死亡或特定身体部位丧失（如四肢、视力等）时提供经济赔偿。该保险通常作为附加险或独立保单出售，覆盖范围包括交通事故、坠落、火灾等意外事件。其核心概念是“意外性”，即事故必须是突发的、非故意的，且直接导致死亡或伤残。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance (AD&D) is an insurance product designed to provide financial compensation to the insured in the event of death or the loss of specific body parts (such as limbs or eyesight) due to an accident. This insurance is typically sold as a rider or standalone policy and covers incidents such as traffic accidents, falls, fires, and other accidental events. The core concept is "accidental," meaning the incident must be sudden, unintentional, and directly cause death or dismemberment.

  AD&D insurance is suitable for individuals in high-risk occupations (e.g., construction workers, firefighters) or those who frequently travel. It can also serve as a supplement to life insurance, providing additional financial security for families.
