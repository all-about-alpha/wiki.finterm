# Addition Rule for Probabilities

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：概率加法规则是概率论中的基本原理之一，用于计算两个事件中至少发生一个事件的概率。其核心概念是，当两个事件互斥（即不能同时发生）时，它们的联合概率等于各自概率之和；当两个事件不互斥时，联合概率等于各自概率之和减去两者同时发生的概率。  
  **English Explanation**: The Addition Rule for Probabilities is a fundamental principle in probability theory used to calculate the probability of at least one of two events occurring. Its core concept is that when two events are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot occur simultaneously), their combined probability equals the sum of their individual probabilities; when two events are not mutually exclusive, the combined probability equals the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring simultaneously.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：概率加法规则广泛应用于金融风险评估、保险精算、投资组合管理等领域。例如，在评估投资组合的风险时，投资者可以计算不同资产价格下跌的概率，从而制定风险对冲策略。需要注意的是，如果事件之间存在相关性，直接应用加法规则可能导致误差。  
  **English Application**: The Addition Rule for Probabilities is widely applied in financial risk assessment, actuarial science, and portfolio management. For example, when assessing the risk of an investment portfolio, investors can calculate the probability of price declines for different assets to develop risk hedging strategies. It is important to note that if events are correlated, directly applying the addition rule may lead to errors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，概率加法规则是金融机构进行压力测试和风险评估的基础工具之一。从投资角度看，它帮助投资者量化不确定性，优化决策。从行业角度看，它是精算师和数据分析师的核心技能之一。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the Addition Rule for Probabilities is a foundational tool for stress testing and risk assessment in financial institutions. From an investment perspective, it helps investors quantify uncertainty and optimize decision-making. From an industry perspective, it is a core skill for actuaries and data analysts.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：概率加法规则的起源可以追溯到17世纪，与概率论的奠基人布莱兹·帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）和皮埃尔·德·费马（Pierre de Fermat）的研究密切相关。他们在研究赌博问题时，首次提出了事件概率的计算方法，为加法规则的形成奠定了基础。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of the Addition Rule for Probabilities dates back to the 17th century, closely tied to the work of probability theory pioneers Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. While studying gambling problems, they first proposed methods for calculating event probabilities, laying the groundwork for the addition rule.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：概率加法规则对现代金融、保险和统计学产生了深远影响。它不仅是概率论的基础，还被广泛应用于风险管理、衍生品定价和人工智能等领域。目前，它已成为全球金融教育和实践中的核心内容。  
  **English Impact**: The Addition Rule for Probabilities has had a profound impact on modern finance, insurance, and statistics. It is not only a cornerstone of probability theory but also widely applied in risk management, derivative pricing, and artificial intelligence. Today, it is a core component of global financial education and practice.
