  **中文解释**：资产周转率（Asset Turnover Ratio）是衡量企业利用其总资产产生销售收入效率的财务指标。其计算公式为：销售收入 ÷ 平均总资产。该比率越高，表明企业资产利用效率越高，反之则说明资产利用效率较低。资产周转率的核心概念在于评估企业资产的管理能力和运营效率。  
  **English Explanation**: The Asset Turnover Ratio is a financial metric that measures how efficiently a company uses its total assets to generate sales revenue.
