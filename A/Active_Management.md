# Active Management

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：主动管理（Active Management）是一种投资策略，由基金经理或投资团队通过深入研究和分析，主动选择投资标的，旨在超越市场基准或指数的表现。其核心理念是通过主动决策（如选股、择时、资产配置等）获取超额收益（Alpha）。这一概念最早由现代投资组合理论的奠基人哈里·马科维茨（Harry Markowitz）提出，并在20世纪中期逐渐成为主流投资策略之一。  
  **English Explanation**: Active Management is an investment strategy where fund managers or investment teams actively select investment targets through in-depth research and analysis, aiming to outperform market benchmarks or indices. The core concept is to generate excess returns (Alpha) through active decision-making, such as stock selection, market timing, and asset allocation. This concept was initially introduced by Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory, and became a mainstream investment strategy in the mid-20th century.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：主动管理广泛应用于股票、债券、对冲基金和私募股权等领域。基金经理通过基本面分析、技术分析或量化模型，寻找被低估的资产或市场机会。然而，主动管理也面临较高成本（如管理费和绩效费）和风险（如选错标的或市场波动）。在中国，主动管理基金在A股市场中占据重要地位，尤其是在市场波动较大时，投资者更倾向于依赖专业管理团队的能力。  
  **English Explanation**: Active Management is widely applied in equities, bonds, hedge funds, and private equity. Fund managers use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or quantitative models to identify undervalued assets or market opportunities. However, it also comes with higher costs (e.g., management fees and performance fees) and risks (e.g., poor stock selection or market volatility). In China, actively managed funds play a significant role in the A-share market, especially during periods of high market volatility, where investors rely more on the expertise of professional management teams.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，主动管理有助于提升市场效率，促进价格发现；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了获取超额收益的机会；从行业角度看，主动管理推动了资产管理行业的专业化和创新。在中国，随着资本市场的发展和投资者需求的多样化，主动管理的重要性日益凸显。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Active Management enhances market efficiency and promotes price discovery. From an investment perspective, it offers opportunities for investors to achieve excess returns. From an industry perspective, it drives the professionalization and innovation of the asset management industry. In China, with the development of capital markets and the diversification of investor needs, the significance of Active Management has become increasingly prominent.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：主动管理的理念可以追溯到20世纪50年代，当时哈里·马科维茨提出了现代投资组合理论（MPT），强调通过分散投资降低风险。随后，威廉·夏普（William Sharpe）等人进一步发展了资本资产定价模型（CAPM），为主动管理提供了理论基础。20世纪70年代，彼得·林奇（Peter Lynch）等传奇基金经理通过卓越的选股能力证明了主动管理的潜力。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Active Management dates back to the 1950s when Harry Markowitz introduced Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), emphasizing risk reduction through diversification. Later, William Sharpe and others developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), providing a theoretical foundation for Active Management. In the 1970s, legendary fund managers like Peter Lynch demonstrated the potential of Active Management through exceptional stock-picking skills.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：主动管理对全球资产管理行业产生了深远影响。它不仅推动了投资策略的多样化，还催生了大量专业投资机构。在中国，主动管理基金在A股市场的崛起，促进了本土资产管理行业的快速发展。然而，近年来，随着被动投资（如指数基金）的兴起，主动管理面临一定挑战，但其在高波动市场中的优势依然显著。  
  **English Explanation**: Active Management has had a profound impact on the global asset management industry. It has not only diversified investment strategies but also led to the emergence of numerous professional investment institutions. In China, the rise of actively managed funds in the A-share market has accelerated the growth of the domestic asset management industry. However, in recent years, with the rise of passive investing (e.g., index funds), Active Management faces challenges, though its advantages in high-volatility markets remain significant.
