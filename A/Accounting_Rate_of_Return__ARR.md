# Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    会计收益率（Accounting Rate of Return, ARR）是一种用于评估投资项目盈利能力的财务指标，通过计算项目预期年平均净利润与初始投资额的比率来衡量。其核心概念是反映投资项目的会计利润回报率，而非现金流回报率。ARR的计算公式为：ARR = （年平均净利润 / 初始投资额）× 100%。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment project by calculating the ratio of the average annual accounting profit to the initial investment. Its core concept is to reflect the accounting profit return of an investment project rather than cash flow return. The formula for ARR is: ARR = (Average Annual Accounting Profit / Initial Investment) × 100%.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用**  
    ARR常用于企业资本预算决策中，尤其是在评估多个投资项目的相对盈利能力时。其应用场景包括制造业、房地产和基础设施建设等领域。然而，ARR的局限性在于未考虑资金的时间价值和现金流的时间分布，因此在复杂投资决策中需与其他指标（如净现值NPV、内部收益率IRR）结合使用。  
  - **English Application**  
    ARR is commonly used in corporate capital budgeting decisions, particularly when comparing the relative profitability of multiple investment projects. Its application scenarios include manufacturing, real estate, and infrastructure development. However, ARR's limitations lie in its failure to account for the time value of money and the timing of cash flows, so it should be used in conjunction with other metrics (such as NPV and IRR) in complex investment decisions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管、投资和行业角度来看，ARR为企业提供了一种简单直观的盈利能力评估工具，尤其适用于中小企业和传统行业。然而，由于其未考虑资金的时间价值，ARR在长期或高风险项目中的应用受到一定限制。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, ARR provides a simple and intuitive tool for assessing profitability, particularly suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises and traditional industries. However, due to its failure to account for the time value of money, ARR's application in long-term or high-risk projects is somewhat limited.
