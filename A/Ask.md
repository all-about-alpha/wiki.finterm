## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “Ask”是金融市场中的一个术语，指卖方愿意出售某种资产（如股票、债券或商品）的最低价格。也称为“卖价”或“卖出报价”。它是买方“Bid”（买价）的对应概念，两者共同构成了市场报价的核心。Ask价格通常高于Bid价格，两者之间的差额称为“买卖价差”（Spread）。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  "Ask" is a financial market term referring to the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a particular asset (such as stocks, bonds, or commodities). It is also known as the "offer price" or "selling price." It is the counterpart to the buyer's "Bid" (bid price), and together they form the core of market quotations. The Ask price is typically higher than the Bid price, and the difference between the two is called the "Bid-Ask Spread."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  Ask价格广泛应用于股票、外汇、期货等金融市场。投资者在交易时，需参考Ask价格来确定买入成本。例如，在股票交易中，投资者若想立即买入某只股票，需以当前Ask价格成交。Ask价格也用于计算买卖价差，价差越小，市场流动性通常越好。需要注意的是，Ask价格可能因市场波动、供需变化或流动性不足而快速变化。  
  **English Application**：  
  The Ask price is widely used in financial markets such as stocks, forex, and futures. Investors refer to the Ask price to determine the cost of purchasing an asset. For example, in stock trading, if an investor wants to buy a stock immediately, they must transact at the current Ask price. The Ask price is also used to calculate the Bid-Ask Spread; a smaller spread usually indicates better market liquidity. It is important to note that the Ask price can change rapidly due to market volatility, supply and demand shifts, or low liquidity.
