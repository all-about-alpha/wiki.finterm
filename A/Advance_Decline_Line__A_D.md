## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    涨跌线（A/D线）是一种用于衡量股票市场中上涨股票数量与下跌股票数量之间差异的技术分析工具。它通过计算每日上涨股票数量减去下跌股票数量的累积值来绘制，反映了市场整体的广度趋势。该指标由技术分析领域的先驱者开发，用于评估市场情绪和潜在趋势。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Advance/Decline Line (A/D Line) is a technical analysis tool used to measure the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks in a market. It is calculated by cumulatively adding the daily difference between the number of advancing stocks and declining stocks, reflecting the overall breadth trend of the market. This indicator was developed by pioneers in technical analysis to assess market sentiment and potential trends.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用**  
    涨跌线常用于判断市场的整体趋势和潜在反转点。例如，当市场指数上涨但A/D线下降时，可能预示着市场上涨动力不足，存在回调风险。投资者可结合其他技术指标（如成交量、均线）使用A/D线来确认市场趋势。需要注意的是，A/D线更适合中长期趋势分析，短期波动可能受到噪音干扰。  
  - **English Application**  
    The A/D Line is commonly used to identify overall market trends and potential reversal points. For instance, if a market index is rising while the A/D Line is declining, it may indicate weak upward momentum and a potential market correction. Investors often use the A/D Line in conjunction with other technical indicators (e.g., volume, moving averages) to confirm market trends. It is important to note that the A/D Line is more suitable for medium- to long-term trend analysis, as short-term fluctuations may be influenced by noise.
