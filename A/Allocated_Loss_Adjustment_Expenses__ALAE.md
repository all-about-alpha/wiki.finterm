# Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    分摊损失调整费用（Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, ALAE）是指保险公司在处理索赔过程中产生的、可以直接分配到具体索赔案件上的费用。这些费用包括调查、评估、法律诉讼、专家咨询等与特定索赔直接相关的支出。ALAE是保险公司在计算赔付成本时的重要组成部分，通常与未分摊损失调整费用（ULAE）区分开来。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE) refer to the costs incurred by an insurance company during the claims handling process that can be directly attributed to specific claims. These expenses include investigation, assessment, legal proceedings, expert consultations, and other costs directly related to individual claims. ALAE is a critical component in calculating the total cost of claims for insurers and is typically distinguished from Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ULAE).

  - **中文应用场景**  
    ALAE主要应用于保险公司的理赔管理过程中，特别是在复杂或高额索赔案件中。例如，在涉及法律诉讼或需要专业评估的车险、责任险或健康险索赔中，ALAE会被详细记录并分摊到具体案件中。保险公司需要精确管理ALAE，以确保理赔成本的透明性和准确性，同时避免过度支出。  
  - **English Application**  
    ALAE is primarily used in the claims management process of insurance companies, especially in complex or high-value claims. For example, in auto insurance, liability insurance, or health insurance claims involving legal disputes or professional assessments, ALAE is meticulously recorded and allocated to specific cases. Insurers must manage ALAE precisely to ensure transparency and accuracy in claims costs while avoiding excessive expenditures.
