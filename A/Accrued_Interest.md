# Accrued Interest

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：应计利息（Accrued Interest）是指自上一次利息支付日至当前日期之间，债券或其他固定收益证券所产生的未支付利息。它是基于债券的面值和票面利率计算的，反映了投资者在持有债券期间应得的利息收益。  
  **English Explanation**: Accrued interest refers to the interest that has accumulated on a bond or other fixed-income security since the last interest payment date up to the current date. It is calculated based on the bond's face value and coupon rate, representing the interest income that investors are entitled to during the holding period.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：应计利息广泛应用于债券交易中。当债券在两次付息日之间被买卖时，买方需向卖方支付应计利息，以补偿卖方在持有期间应得的利息。这一机制确保了利息分配的公平性。需要注意的是，应计利息的计算可能因债券类型（如零息债券、浮动利率债券）而有所不同。  
  **English Explanation**: Accrued interest is widely used in bond trading. When a bond is traded between two interest payment dates, the buyer must pay the seller the accrued interest to compensate for the interest earned during the holding period. This mechanism ensures fair interest distribution. It is important to note that the calculation of accrued interest may vary depending on the type of bond (e.g., zero-coupon bonds, floating-rate bonds).

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：应计利息在金融市场中具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它确保了利息分配的透明性和公平性；从投资角度看，它是投资者计算实际收益的重要指标；从行业角度看，它是债券定价和交易的基础之一。  
  **English Explanation**: Accrued interest holds significant importance in financial markets. From a regulatory perspective, it ensures transparency and fairness in interest distribution.
