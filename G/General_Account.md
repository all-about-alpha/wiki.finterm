## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  一般账户（General Account）是指保险公司用于记录和管理其核心业务活动（如承保、投资等）的主要账户。它是保险公司财务报表中的核心部分，用于存放保费收入、支付理赔款项以及进行投资活动。一般账户通常与分离账户（Separate Account）相对，后者主要用于管理特定投资产品或与保单持有人利益直接相关的资金。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A General Account refers to the primary account used by insurance companies to record and manage their core business activities, such as underwriting and investments. It is a central component of an insurer's financial statements, where premium income is deposited, claims are paid, and investment activities are conducted. The General Account is typically contrasted with a Separate Account, which is used to manage specific investment products or funds directly tied to policyholder interests.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  一般账户广泛应用于保险公司的日常运营中，包括收取保费、支付理赔、进行固定收益类投资（如债券）等。由于其资金主要用于支持保险公司的长期负债（如寿险保单），因此一般账户的投资策略通常较为保守，以保障资金安全性和流动性为主。需要注意的是，一般账户的资金使用需符合监管要求，避免过度风险暴露。  
  **English Application**：  
  The General Account is widely used in the daily operations of insurance companies, including collecting premiums, paying claims, and investing in fixed-income assets like bonds. Since the funds in the General Account are primarily used to support long-term liabilities (e.g., life insurance policies), the investment strategy is generally conservative, focusing on safety and liquidity. It is important to note that the use of funds in the General Account must comply with regulatory requirements to avoid excessive risk exposure.

  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, the General Account is a key indicator of an insurer's financial stability, and regulators closely scrutinize its fund usage and investment portfolio. From an investment standpoint, the asset allocation in the General Account directly impacts the insurer's profitability and solvency.
