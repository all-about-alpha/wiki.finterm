# Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    隔代转移税（Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax, GSTT）是美国联邦政府针对跨代财产转移征收的一种税种。该税种旨在防止富人通过将财产直接转移给孙辈或更远的后代，从而规避遗产税和赠与税。GSTT适用于直接跳过一代（如祖父母直接转移财产给孙辈）的财产转移行为，确保每一代都承担相应的税务责任。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) is a federal tax in the United States levied on transfers of wealth that skip a generation, such as from grandparents to grandchildren. It is designed to prevent wealthy individuals from avoiding estate and gift taxes by transferring assets directly to grandchildren or more remote descendants. The GSTT ensures that each generation bears its fair share of tax liability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    GSTT主要应用于高净值家庭的财产规划中。例如，祖父母设立信托基金直接受益人为孙辈时，可能会触发GSTT。此外，在家族企业传承或大额赠与中，若财产直接跳过子女转移给孙辈，也可能需要缴纳GSTT。需要注意的是，GSTT的税率较高（与联邦遗产税最高税率一致），因此在进行财产规划时需谨慎评估税务影响。  
  - **English Application**  
    The GSTT is primarily applied in estate planning for high-net-worth families. For example, when grandparents establish a trust with grandchildren as direct beneficiaries, the GSTT may be triggered. Additionally, in cases of family business succession or large gifts, if assets are transferred directly to grandchildren, bypassing the children, the GSTT may apply. It is important to note that the GSTT rate is high (aligned with the highest federal estate tax rate), so careful tax planning is essential.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，GSTT是美国税收体系的重要组成部分，旨在确保税收公平性和防止财富过度集中。从投资和行业角度看，GSTT对家族财富管理、信托设计和遗产规划产生深远影响，促使高净值家庭更加注重税务合规和长期财富传承策略。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, the GSTT is a critical component of the U.S. tax system, ensuring tax fairness and preventing excessive wealth concentration. From an investment and industry standpoint, the GSTT significantly impacts family wealth management, trust design, and estate planning, prompting high-net-worth families to prioritize tax compliance and long-term wealth transfer strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**
