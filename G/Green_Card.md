# Green Card

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  绿卡（Green Card）是美国政府颁发给外国公民的永久居留许可证，正式名称为“永久居民卡”（Permanent Resident Card）。持有绿卡的外国人可以在美国合法居住、工作，并享有与美国公民相似的权利（如教育、医疗等），但不包括选举权和被选举权。绿卡因其历史上曾采用绿色设计而得名。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Green Card, officially known as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued by the U.S. government to foreign nationals, granting them permanent residency in the United States. Green Card holders are allowed to live and work legally in the U.S. and enjoy rights similar to U.S. citizens (e.g., access to education and healthcare), except for voting and running for public office. The name "Green Card" originates from its historical green-colored design.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  绿卡主要适用于希望长期在美国生活、工作或投资的外国人。常见申请途径包括家庭团聚、职业移民、投资移民（如EB-5签证）以及抽签移民（如多元化移民签证计划）。申请绿卡需满足特定条件，如通过背景调查、健康检查等。持有绿卡后，需注意维持居住要求，避免因长期离境而失去身份。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  The Green Card is primarily for foreign nationals seeking to live, work, or invest in the U.S. long-term. Common pathways include family reunification, employment-based immigration (e.g., EB-1, EB-2), investment-based immigration (e.g., EB-5 visa), and the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (lottery). Applicants must meet specific requirements, such as passing background checks and medical examinations. After obtaining a Green Card, holders must maintain residency requirements to avoid losing their status due to prolonged absences.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  绿卡的历史可以追溯到1940年，当时美国政府首次引入“外国人登记卡”（Alien Registration Receipt Card），用于管理外国居民。1950年，卡片改为绿色设计，绿卡一词由此得名。此后，绿卡的设计和功能多次更新，但其核心作用——授予外国人在美永久居留权——始终未变。  
  **English Origin**  
  The history of the Green Card dates back to 1940 when the U.S. government introduced the Alien Registration Receipt Card to manage foreign residents. In 1950, the card was redesigned with a green color, giving rise to the term "Green Card." Over the years, the design and features of the card have evolved, but its core purpose—granting permanent residency to foreign nationals—has remained unchanged.
