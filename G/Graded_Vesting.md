# Graded Vesting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  分级归属（Graded Vesting）是一种员工股权激励计划中的归属安排方式，指员工在一定时间内逐步获得公司授予的股权或期权。通常，归属过程会按照预先设定的时间表分阶段进行，例如每年归属一定比例的股权，直到全部归属完成。这种方式旨在激励员工长期留在公司并为其持续创造价值。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Graded Vesting is a type of vesting arrangement in employee equity incentive plans, where employees gradually earn the rights to company-granted shares or options over a specified period. Typically, the vesting process occurs in stages according to a predetermined schedule, such as a certain percentage of shares vesting each year until full ownership is achieved. This approach aims to incentivize employees to remain with the company long-term and contribute to its sustained growth.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  分级归属广泛应用于初创企业和上市公司，特别是在股权激励计划中。例如，一家公司可能规定员工在四年内每年归属25%的股权，以确保员工在较长时间内与公司利益绑定。需要注意的是，如果员工在归属期内离职，未归属的部分将失效，因此员工需权衡长期发展与短期收益。  
  **English Application**  
  Graded Vesting is widely used in startups and public companies, particularly in equity incentive plans. For instance, a company might stipulate that 25% of the granted shares vest each year over four years, ensuring employees remain aligned with the company’s interests over the long term. It’s important to note that if an employee leaves before the vesting period is complete, the unvested portion is forfeited, requiring employees to balance long-term growth with short-term gains.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**

  **English Significance**
