## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》（Glass-Steagall Act）是1933年美国大萧条时期通过的一项金融法规，由参议员卡特·格拉斯（Carter Glass）和众议员亨利·斯蒂格尔（Henry Steagall）共同提出。该法案的核心内容是将商业银行与投资银行业务分离，禁止商业银行从事证券交易和投资银行业务，以防止银行利用存款进行高风险投资，从而保护储户的利益。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The Glass-Steagall Act, enacted in 1933 during the Great Depression, was a U.S. financial regulation proposed by Senator Carter Glass and Representative Henry Steagall. Its core provision was the separation of commercial banking from investment banking, prohibiting commercial banks from engaging in securities trading and investment banking activities. This was intended to prevent banks from using deposits for high-risk investments, thereby safeguarding depositors' interests.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  该法案在1933年至1999年间有效实施，主要应用于美国的银行业。它要求商业银行专注于传统的存贷款业务，而投资银行则专注于证券发行和交易。这一分离旨在降低金融系统的风险，防止银行因过度投机而破产。然而，随着金融创新和全球化的发展，该法案的严格分离被认为限制了银行的竞争力，最终在1999年被《金融服务现代化法案》（Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act）废除。  
  **English Application**  
  The Act was effectively implemented from 1933 to 1999, primarily affecting the U.S. banking sector. It required commercial banks to focus on traditional deposit and loan services, while investment banks specialized in securities issuance and trading. This separation aimed to reduce systemic risk in the financial system and prevent bank failures due to excessive speculation. However, with the rise of financial innovation and globalization, the strict separation was seen as limiting banks' competitiveness, leading to its eventual repeal by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》的诞生源于1929年股市崩盘和随后的大萧条。当时，许多银行因过度参与证券投机而破产，导致储户损失惨重。1933年，罗斯福总统签署了《银行法》（Banking Act of 1933），其中包含了《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》的内容。该法案的提出者卡特·格拉斯和亨利·斯蒂格尔希望通过立法手段恢复公众对银行业的信心。  
  **English Origin**  
  The Glass-Steagall Act originated from the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. At the time, many banks failed due to excessive involvement in securities speculation, leading to significant losses for depositors. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933, which included the Glass-Steagall provisions. The Act's sponsors, Carter Glass and Henry Steagall, aimed to restore public confidence in the banking system through legislative measures.

  **中文影响**  
  《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》对美国银行业产生了深远影响。在其实施期间，商业银行与投资银行的分离有效降低了金融系统的风险。然而，随着金融市场的复杂化和全球化，该法案的局限性逐渐显现。1999年，该法案被废除，允许银行重新整合商业和投资银行业务。这一变化被认为是2008年金融危机的一个重要因素。  
  **English Impact**  
  The Glass-Steagall Act had a profound impact on the U.S. banking industry. During its enforcement, the separation of commercial and investment banking effectively reduced systemic risk. However, as financial markets became more complex and globalized, the Act's limitations became apparent. Its repeal in 1999 allowed banks to reintegrate commercial and investment banking activities, a change often cited as a contributing factor to the 2008 financial crisis.
