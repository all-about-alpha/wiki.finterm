# Gate Provision

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  Gate Provision（门限条款）是一种在金融合同或投资协议中常见的条款，旨在限制投资者在特定条件下赎回或退出投资的权利。该条款通常用于对冲基金、私募股权基金或其他封闭式投资工具中，以防止大规模赎回导致基金流动性危机。核心概念包括设定赎回门槛（如时间限制、金额限制或市场条件），以保护基金的长期运作和投资者的整体利益。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Gate Provision is a common clause in financial contracts or investment agreements designed to restrict investors' rights to redeem or exit investments under specific conditions. This provision is typically used in hedge funds, private equity funds, or other closed-end investment vehicles to prevent large-scale redemptions that could lead to liquidity crises. Key concepts include setting redemption thresholds (such as time limits, amount limits, or market conditions) to protect the fund's long-term operation and the overall interests of investors.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  Gate Provision 主要应用于对冲基金和私募股权基金中。例如，在市场波动剧烈时，基金可能触发门限条款，限制投资者在一定时间内赎回资金，以避免因大规模赎回导致的资产抛售和价格下跌。风险提示：投资者需注意此类条款可能影响资金的流动性，尤其是在市场低迷时，可能无法及时退出投资。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Gate Provisions are primarily used in hedge funds and private equity funds. For instance, during periods of significant market volatility, a fund may trigger the gate provision to limit investors' ability to redeem funds within a certain period, thereby avoiding asset sell-offs and price declines caused by large-scale redemptions. Risk Note: Investors should be aware that such provisions may impact liquidity, particularly during market downturns, potentially preventing timely exits from investments.

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, Gate Provisions help maintain financial market stability by preventing systemic risks arising from large-scale redemptions. From an investment standpoint, they provide fund managers with greater operational flexibility, ensuring the fund can operate steadily amid market volatility.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  Gate Provision 的起源可以追溯到20世纪90年代的对冲基金行业。当时，一些对冲基金因市场波动遭遇大规模赎回，导致基金流动性危机。为应对这一问题，基金管理人开始引入门限条款，限制投资者在特定条件下的赎回权利。这一做法逐渐被行业采纳，并成为对冲基金和私募股权基金的标准条款之一。  
  **English Origin**  
  The origin of Gate Provisions can be traced back to the hedge fund industry in the 1990s. At that time, some hedge funds faced large-scale redemptions due to market volatility, leading to liquidity crises. To address this issue, fund managers began introducing gate provisions to restrict investors' redemption rights under specific conditions. This practice gradually gained industry acceptance and became a standard clause in hedge funds and private equity funds.

  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of Gate Provisions significantly enhanced the risk resilience of hedge funds and private equity funds, particularly during the 2008 global financial crisis, when many funds avoided greater losses by triggering these provisions.
