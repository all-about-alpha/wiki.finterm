# Groupthink

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **群体思维**（Groupthink）是由心理学家欧文·詹尼斯（Irving Janis）于1972年提出的概念，指在群体决策过程中，成员为了追求和谐与共识，忽视或压制不同意见，导致决策质量下降的现象。核心特征包括从众心理、自我审查和对异议的排斥。  
  **Groupthink** is a concept introduced by psychologist Irving Janis in 1972, referring to a phenomenon in group decision-making where members prioritize harmony and consensus over critical evaluation, leading to poor decision outcomes. Key characteristics include conformity, self-censorship, and the suppression of dissenting opinions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在企业管理、政府决策和投资分析中，群体思维可能导致重大失误。例如，企业高管团队可能因追求一致而忽视市场风险；政府决策者可能因避免冲突而制定不合理的政策；投资团队可能因盲目跟风而忽略潜在风险。防范措施包括鼓励多元化意见、引入外部专家和建立独立的评估机制。  
  In corporate management, government decision-making, and investment analysis, groupthink can lead to significant errors. For instance, executive teams may overlook market risks in pursuit of consensus; policymakers may enact flawed policies to avoid conflict; investment teams may ignore potential risks due to herd behavior. Preventive measures include encouraging diverse opinions, involving external experts, and establishing independent evaluation mechanisms.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，群体思维的危害不容忽视。它可能导致系统性风险、投资失败和创新停滞。识别和避免群体思维对于提升决策质量、维护市场稳定和推动行业发展至关重要。  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the dangers of groupthink cannot be ignored. It can lead to systemic risks, investment failures, and innovation stagnation. Recognizing and avoiding groupthink is crucial for improving decision quality, maintaining market stability, and driving industry progress.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  群体思维的概念源于欧文·詹尼斯对20世纪60年代美国外交政策失败的研究，如猪湾事件和越南战争升级。他发现这些决策失误与团队内部的过度一致性和对异议的压制密切相关。1972年，詹尼斯在其著作《群体思维的受害者》中正式提出这一理论。  
  The concept of groupthink originated from Irving Janis’s study of U.S. foreign policy failures in the 1960s, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion and the escalation of the Vietnam War. He found that these decision-making errors were closely linked to excessive conformity and suppression of dissent within teams. In 1972, Janis formally introduced this theory in his book *Victims of Groupthink*.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  群体思维理论在心理学、管理学和政治学领域产生了深远影响。它被广泛应用于分析企业破产、金融危机和政府政策失误等案例。如今，许多组织和机构通过改进决策流程来防范群体思维的影响，例如引入“魔鬼代言人”角色或采用匿名投票机制。  
  The theory of groupthink has had a profound impact in psychology, management studies, and political science. It is widely used to analyze cases such as corporate bankruptcies, financial crises, and government policy failures. Today, many organizations mitigate the effects of groupthink by improving decision-making processes—for example, by introducing a “devil’s advocate” role or adopting anonymous voting mechanisms.
