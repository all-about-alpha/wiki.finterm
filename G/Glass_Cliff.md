# Glass Cliff

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “玻璃悬崖”（Glass Cliff）是一个管理学和社会学术语，由英国埃克塞特大学的米歇尔·瑞安（Michelle Ryan）和亚历山大·哈斯拉姆（S. Alexander Haslam）于2005年提出。它描述了女性或少数群体在组织危机或高风险时期被任命为领导职位的现象。这些职位往往伴随着更高的失败风险，因为组织本身已处于困境中。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The term "Glass Cliff" is a management and sociological concept coined by Michelle Ryan and S. Alexander Haslam from the University of Exeter in 2005. It describes the phenomenon where women or minority groups are appointed to leadership positions during times of organizational crisis or high risk. These roles often come with a higher likelihood of failure, as the organization is already in a precarious state.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  在企业或政治领域，当组织面临危机时，女性或少数群体领导者可能被推上高位，承担扭转局面的重任。然而，由于危机本身的复杂性，这些领导者更容易因失败而受到指责。例如，金融危机期间，一些女性CEO被任命为濒临破产企业的领导者。  
  **English Application**  
  In corporate or political settings, women or minority leaders may be appointed to high-ranking positions during times of crisis, tasked with turning the situation around. However, due to the inherent complexity of the crisis, these leaders are more likely to be blamed for failures. For example, during financial crises, some female CEOs have been appointed to lead companies on the brink of bankruptcy.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，“玻璃悬崖”现象揭示了组织在危机管理中的性别偏见和风险分配不均问题。它提醒人们关注领导层多样性的同时，也要警惕将少数群体置于高风险职位的潜在不公。  
  **English Significance**  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the "Glass Cliff" phenomenon highlights issues of gender bias and unequal risk distribution in crisis management. It serves as a reminder to promote leadership diversity while being cautious about the potential injustice of placing minority groups in high-risk positions.
