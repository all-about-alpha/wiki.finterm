## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：Guilder Share的起源可以追溯到20世纪中期，当时荷兰企业开始寻求在美国资本市场的融资机会。为了吸引美国投资者并降低汇率风险，这些企业选择以荷兰盾计价在纽约证券交易所上市。这一做法在20世纪70年代至90年代较为流行，但随着欧元的引入和荷兰盾的退出流通，其使用逐渐减少。  
  - **English Origin**: The origin of Guilder Shares dates back to the mid-20th century when Dutch companies began seeking financing opportunities in U.S. capital markets. To attract American investors and mitigate exchange rate risks, these companies chose to list on the New York Stock Exchange with shares denominated in Dutch Guilders. This practice was popular from the 1970s to the 1990s but gradually declined with the introduction of the Euro and the discontinuation of the Dutch Guilder.
