# Golden Parachute

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  金色降落伞（Golden Parachute）是指公司高层管理人员在因公司被收购或控制权变更而离职时，获得的高额经济补偿协议。这一机制旨在保护高管在并购或重组过程中的利益，通常包括一次性支付、股票期权、奖金或其他福利。其核心概念是通过经济保障，减少高管对控制权变更的抵触情绪，同时确保公司管理层的稳定性。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Golden Parachute refers to a lucrative financial agreement provided to top executives in the event of their termination due to a company's acquisition or change in control. This mechanism is designed to protect executives' interests during mergers or reorganizations, typically including lump-sum payments, stock options, bonuses, or other benefits. The core concept is to provide financial security, reduce executives' resistance to changes in control, and ensure management stability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  金色降落伞常见于上市公司或大型企业，尤其是在并购活动频繁的行业（如科技、金融等）。其应用场景包括公司被收购、合并或控制权转移时，确保高管在离职时获得经济补偿。然而，这一机制也可能引发争议，因为高额补偿可能被视为损害股东利益或公司财务健康。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  Golden Parachutes are commonly found in publicly traded companies or large corporations, especially in industries with frequent mergers and acquisitions (e.g., technology, finance). They are applied in scenarios such as company acquisitions, mergers, or changes in control to ensure executives receive financial compensation upon departure. However, this mechanism can also be controversial, as excessive payouts may be seen as detrimental to shareholder interests or the company's financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，金色降落伞可能引发对公司治理和股东权益保护的关注；从投资角度看，它可能影响投资者对公司的信心；从行业角度看，它有助于吸引和保留高级管理人才，但也可能导致管理层过度依赖这一机制而忽视公司长期发展。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, Golden Parachutes may raise concerns about corporate governance and shareholder rights protection. From an investment standpoint, they can impact investor confidence in a company. From an industry perspective, they help attract and retain top management talent but may also lead to over-reliance on this mechanism at the expense of long-term company growth.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  金色降落伞的概念起源于20世纪60年代的美国，最初是为了应对日益频繁的企业并购活动。1970年代，随着敌意收购的兴起，这一机制逐渐普及。1980年代，美国税法对高额补偿的限制进一步推动了金色降落伞的规范化发展。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of the Golden Parachute originated in the United States in the 1960s, initially as a response to the increasing frequency of corporate mergers and acquisitions. During the 1970s, with the rise of hostile takeovers, this mechanism became more widespread. In the 1980s, U.S. tax regulations limiting excessive compensation further standardized the development of Golden Parachutes.
