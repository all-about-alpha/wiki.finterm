  “金发女孩经济”（Goldilocks Economy）是一个经济学术语，用来描述一种理想的经济状态：经济增长既不过热也不过冷，通胀和失业率保持在较低水平，利率适中，整体经济环境“刚刚好”。这一概念源自童话故事《金发女孩与三只熊》，金发女孩选择了“不冷不热”的粥，用来比喻经济处于“恰到好处”的状态。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The "Goldilocks Economy" is an economic term used to describe an ideal state of the economy where growth is neither too hot nor too cold, inflation and unemployment remain low, interest rates are moderate, and the overall economic environment is "just right." The term is derived from the fairy tale "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," where Goldilocks chooses porridge that is "not too hot, not too cold," symbolizing an economy that is perfectly balanced.

  **English Application**：  
  A Goldilocks Economy typically occurs during periods of economic recovery or stable growth and is relevant for policymakers, investors, and business decision-makers. In such an environment, central banks do not need to make drastic monetary policy adjustments, corporate investments and consumer confidence are high, and stock markets generally perform well. However, this state can be difficult to sustain long-term, and any shift toward overheating or cooling can lead to market volatility.
