  **English Explanation**：

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  “金握手”通常应用于企业高管离职、公司重组或并购等场景。例如，当一家公司被收购时，原高管可能会收到一笔丰厚的补偿金以换取其自愿离职。需要注意的是，这种补偿可能引发股东不满或被视为公司资源的浪费，因此需谨慎使用。  
  **English Application**：  
  Golden Handshakes are commonly used in scenarios such as executive departures, corporate restructuring, or mergers and acquisitions. For instance, when a company is acquired, its executives might receive a substantial payout in exchange for voluntary resignation.
