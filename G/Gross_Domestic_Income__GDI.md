# Gross Domestic Income (GDI)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：国内总收入（Gross Domestic Income, GDI）是指一个国家在一定时期内，所有居民和非居民在生产活动中所获得的总收入。它包括工资、利润、利息和租金等收入形式。GDI与国内生产总值（GDP）在理论上应相等，因为它们从不同角度衡量同一经济活动。  
  **English Explanation**: Gross Domestic Income (GDI) refers to the total income earned by all residents and non-residents within a country during a specific period from production activities. It includes wages, profits, interest, and rents. In theory, GDI should equal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as they measure the same economic activity from different perspectives.
