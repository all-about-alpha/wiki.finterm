# Gross Income Multiplier (GIM)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：总收益乘数（Gross Income Multiplier, GIM）是一种用于评估房地产投资价值的财务指标，通过将物业的市场价格除以其年总收入来计算。该指标反映了投资者为获得每单位收入所支付的价格，常用于快速比较不同物业的投资吸引力。  
  **English Explanation**: The Gross Income Multiplier (GIM) is a financial metric used to evaluate the value of real estate investments by dividing the property's market price by its annual gross income. This indicator reflects the price investors pay for each unit of income and is commonly used to quickly compare the investment appeal of different properties.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：GIM广泛应用于房地产投资分析中，特别是在初步筛选物业时。它适用于收入稳定的物业类型，如公寓楼、办公楼等。然而，GIM未考虑运营成本、税收等因素，因此需结合其他指标（如净收益率）进行综合评估。风险提示：GIM可能低估高运营成本物业的实际投资价值。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: GIM is widely used in real estate investment analysis, especially during the initial screening of properties. It is suitable for properties with stable income streams, such as apartment buildings and office spaces. However, GIM does not account for operating costs, taxes, and other factors, so it should be used alongside other metrics (e.g., net yield) for comprehensive evaluation. Risk Note: GIM may underestimate the actual investment value of properties with high operating costs.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，GIM为投资者提供了一种简单有效的工具来评估物业的潜在回报；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者快速识别高性价比的资产；从行业角度看，GIM促进了房地产市场的透明度和标准化评估流程。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, GIM provides investors with a simple yet effective tool to assess potential returns on properties; from an investment perspective, it helps investors quickly identify cost-effective assets; from an industry perspective, GIM promotes transparency and standardized evaluation processes in the real estate market.
