* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：赠与分割主要应用于夫妻之间的财产赠与，特别是在大额赠与（如房产、股票等）时，通过分割赠与金额，双方可以充分利用各自的年度赠与税免税额（如美国的年度免税额为每人$17,000，2023年数据）。需要注意的是，赠与分割需要夫妻双方同意，并在税务申报时明确声明。  
  **English Explanation**: Gift splitting is primarily applied to spousal gifts, especially for large gifts such as real estate or stocks. By splitting the gift amount, both spouses can fully utilize their annual gift tax exclusions (e.g., $17,000 per person in the U.S. for 2023). It is important to note that gift splitting requires mutual consent from both spouses and must be explicitly declared in tax filings.
