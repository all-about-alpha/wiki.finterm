  **中文解释**：绿票讹诈（Greenmail）是指一家公司或投资者通过大量购买目标公司的股票，威胁发起敌意收购，迫使目标公司以溢价回购其股票，从而从中获利的行为。这一术语源自“green”（美元的颜色）和“blackmail”（讹诈）的组合。  
  **English Explanation**: Greenmail refers to the practice where a company or investor purchases a significant portion of a target company's shares, threatens a hostile takeover, and forces the target company to buy back the shares at a premium, thereby profiting from the transaction. The term is a blend of "green" (the color of money) and "blackmail."

* **应用 / Application**

  **English Application**: Greenmail typically occurs in capital markets, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises or companies with dispersed ownership structures. This practice can lead to the target company paying a high premium, harming other shareholders' interests. Investors should be wary of such practices, and regulators need to strengthen measures against such market manipulation.
