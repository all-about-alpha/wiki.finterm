# Gresham's Law

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：格雷欣法则（Gresham's Law）是由英国金融家托马斯·格雷欣（Thomas Gresham）在16世纪提出的经济学原理，核心概念是“劣币驱逐良币”。当市场上同时存在两种货币，且其中一种货币的实际价值低于其名义价值时，人们倾向于保留高价值的货币而使用低价值的货币进行交易，最终导致高价值货币退出流通。  
  **English Explanation**: Gresham's Law, proposed by the English financier Thomas Gresham in the 16th century, is an economic principle stating that "bad money drives out good." When two forms of money circulate simultaneously, and one is undervalued relative to its face value, people tend to hoard the higher-value money and use the lower-value money for transactions, eventually driving the higher-value money out of circulation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：格雷欣法则在金融市场上常见于货币贬值或通货膨胀时期。例如，当政府发行劣质硬币或纸币时，人们会囤积贵金属或外币，导致劣质货币成为主要流通手段。此外，该法则也适用于非货币领域，如低质量产品驱逐高质量产品的现象。风险在于可能导致市场信任度下降和经济效率降低。  
  **English Application**: Gresham's Law is often observed in financial markets during periods of currency devaluation or inflation. For instance, when governments issue debased coins or paper currency, people hoard precious metals or foreign currencies, causing the debased money to dominate circulation. The law also applies to non-monetary contexts, such as low-quality products driving out high-quality ones. Risks include reduced market trust and economic inefficiency.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，格雷欣法则提醒政府需谨慎管理货币政策，避免因发行劣质货币而引发经济问题。从投资角度看，投资者需警惕市场中的“劣币”现象，选择优质资产以规避风险。从行业角度看，该法则揭示了市场竞争中质量与价格的关系，对企业制定策略具有指导意义。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Gresham's Law warns governments to manage monetary policies carefully to avoid economic issues caused by issuing debased currency. From an investment perspective, investors must be wary of "bad money" phenomena in markets and choose high-quality assets to mitigate risks. From an industry perspective, the law highlights the relationship between quality and price in market competition, offering strategic guidance for businesses.

  **English Origin**: Gresham's Law was first articulated by Thomas Gresham in a letter to Queen Elizabeth I in 1558. At the time, England faced economic turmoil due to the widespread circulation of debased coins with reduced silver content.
