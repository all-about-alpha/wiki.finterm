# Going Concern

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  持续经营（Going Concern）是一个会计和财务概念，指企业在可预见的未来能够持续运营，没有破产或清算的意图或必要。这一概念由国际会计准则（IAS）和美国通用会计准则（GAAP）等主要会计准则体系所采用，是财务报表编制的基础假设之一。核心概念包括企业的持续运营能力、财务稳定性以及管理层对未来经营的信心。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Going Concern is an accounting and financial concept that assumes a business will continue to operate in the foreseeable future without the intention or necessity of liquidation or bankruptcy. This concept is adopted by major accounting standards such as International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the U.S. It is a fundamental assumption in the preparation of financial statements. Core concepts include the entity's ability to continue operations, financial stability, and management's confidence in future operations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  持续经营假设广泛应用于财务报表编制、审计和投资分析中。例如，在编制资产负债表时，资产和负债的分类和估值均基于企业持续经营的前提。审计师在审计过程中需评估企业是否具备持续经营能力，若发现重大不确定性，需在审计报告中披露。对于投资者而言，持续经营能力是评估企业长期价值的重要指标。需要注意的是，若企业面临财务困境或经营环境恶化，持续经营假设可能不再适用，此时需采用清算基础编制财务报表。  

  **English Application**  
  The Going Concern assumption is widely applied in financial statement preparation, auditing, and investment analysis. For example, when preparing a balance sheet, the classification and valuation of assets and liabilities are based on the premise that the business will continue to operate. Auditors must assess the entity's ability to continue as a going concern during the audit process. If significant uncertainties are identified, they must be disclosed in the audit report. For investors, the going concern assumption is a critical indicator of a company's long-term value. It is important to note that if a company faces financial distress or a deteriorating operating environment, the going concern assumption may no longer apply, and financial statements should be prepared on a liquidation basis.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，持续经营假设是财务报表真实性和公允性的基础，确保企业财务状况和经营成果得到准确反映。从投资角度看，持续经营能力直接影响企业的估值和融资能力，是投资者决策的重要依据。从行业角度看，这一概念有助于维护市场信心和金融稳定，特别是在经济下行或行业危机时期。  

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Going Concern assumption is fundamental to the truthfulness and fairness of financial statements, ensuring that a company's financial position and operating results are accurately reflected.

From an industry perspective, this concept helps maintain market confidence and financial stability, particularly during economic downturns or industry crises.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  持续经营概念的起源可以追溯到19世纪末的工业革命时期。随着大规模企业的兴起，投资者和债权人需要更可靠的财务信息来评估企业的长期生存能力。20世纪初，随着现代会计理论的发展，持续经营假设被正式纳入会计准则。例如，1934年美国证券交易委员会（SEC）成立后，持续经营成为财务报表编制的重要原则之一。  

  **English Origin**  
  The concept of Going Concern dates back to the late 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. With the rise of large-scale enterprises, investors and creditors needed more reliable financial information to assess the long-term viability of businesses. In the early 20th century, as modern accounting theory developed, the Going Concern assumption was formally incorporated into accounting standards. For example, after the establishment of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934, Going Concern became a key principle in financial statement preparation.

  持续经营假设对全球会计和金融行业产生了深远影响。它不仅规范了财务报表的编制标准，还提高了财务信息的透明度和可比性。在经济危机或企业破产事件中，持续经营假设的适用性常成为争议焦点。例如，2008年全球金融危机期间，许多企业的持续经营能力受到质疑，导致会计准则和审计实践的重大调整。  

  **English Impact**  
  The Going Concern assumption has had a profound impact on the global accounting and financial industries. It has not only standardized financial statement preparation but also enhanced the transparency and comparability of financial information.
