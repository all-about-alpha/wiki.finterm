# Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 保证承保寿险（Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance）是一种无需体检或健康问卷即可获得的人寿保险。保险公司承诺无论投保人的健康状况如何，都会提供保险保障。这种保险通常适用于高龄人群或健康状况不佳者，但保额较低，保费较高。  
  **English Explanation**: Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance is a type of life insurance that does not require a medical exam or health questionnaire for approval. The insurer guarantees coverage regardless of the applicant's health condition. This insurance is typically designed for older individuals or those with poor health, but it offers lower coverage amounts and higher premiums.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 保证承保寿险主要应用于无法通过传统人寿保险审核的人群，如老年人或患有慢性疾病者。它常用于覆盖丧葬费用或为家人提供基本的经济保障。然而，投保人需注意其高保费和等待期（通常为2年），在此期间内若因自然原因身故，可能仅退还已缴保费而非全额赔付。  
  **English Explanation**: Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance is primarily used by individuals who cannot qualify for traditional life insurance, such as seniors or those with chronic illnesses. It is often used to cover funeral expenses or provide basic financial support for families. However, applicants should be aware of its high premiums and waiting period (usually 2 years), during which natural causes of death may only result in a refund of paid premiums rather than a full payout.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从行业角度看，保证承保寿险填补了传统保险市场的空白，为高风险人群提供了保障选择。从监管角度看，它确保了保险的普惠性，但也需防范过度营销和高费率问题。对投保人而言，它是一种“最后的选择”，在无法获得其他保险时提供基本保障。  
  **English Explanation**: From an industry perspective, Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance fills a gap in the traditional insurance market by providing coverage options for high-risk individuals. From a regulatory standpoint, it ensures the inclusivity of insurance but also requires vigilance against over-marketing and excessive rates. For policyholders, it serves as a "last resort" option, offering basic protection when other insurance is unavailable.
