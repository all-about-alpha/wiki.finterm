# Generation-Skipping Trust

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：隔代信托（Generation-Skipping Trust，简称GST）是一种信托安排，允许委托人将资产直接转移给孙辈或更远的后代，从而跳过子女一代。这种信托的主要目的是规避遗产税和赠与税，同时确保财富在家族中长期传承。隔代信托通常受到美国《隔代转移税》（Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax, GSTT）的监管。  
  **English Explanation**: A Generation-Skipping Trust (GST) is a trust arrangement that allows the grantor to transfer assets directly to grandchildren or more remote descendants, bypassing the children's generation. The primary purpose of this trust is to avoid estate and gift taxes while ensuring long-term wealth preservation within the family. GSTs are typically regulated by the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) in the United States.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：隔代信托常用于高净值家庭，特别是那些希望减少税务负担并确保财富跨代传承的家庭。例如，祖父母可以通过设立隔代信托将资产直接转移给孙辈，从而避免子女一代的遗产税。然而，设立隔代信托需要谨慎规划，因为其可能触发隔代转移税，且信托条款的灵活性较低。  
  **English Explanation**: Generation-Skipping Trusts are commonly used by high-net-worth families, particularly those seeking to reduce tax burdens and ensure intergenerational wealth transfer. For example, grandparents can establish a GST to transfer assets directly to their grandchildren, thereby avoiding estate taxes at the children's level. However, setting up a GST requires careful planning, as it may trigger the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax, and the trust terms are often less flexible.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，隔代信托是税务规划的重要工具，但其复杂的税务规则要求专业顾问的参与。从投资和行业角度看，隔代信托为财富管理行业提供了高附加值的服务机会，同时也推动了信托法律和税务政策的完善。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, GSTs are a crucial tool for tax planning, but their complex tax rules necessitate the involvement of professional advisors. From an investment and industry standpoint, GSTs provide high-value service opportunities for the wealth management sector and drive the refinement of trust laws and tax policies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：隔代信托的概念起源于20世纪中期的美国，当时高净值家庭开始寻求更有效的财富传承方式。1976年，美国国会通过了《隔代转移税法案》（GSTT），正式将隔代信托纳入税务监管体系。这一法案旨在防止富人通过跳过一代来规避遗产税。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Generation-Skipping Trusts originated in the mid-20th century in the United States, when high-net-worth families began seeking more efficient methods of wealth transfer. In 1976, the U.S. Congress passed the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Act (GSTT), formally incorporating GSTs into the tax regulatory framework. This act aimed to prevent wealthy individuals from avoiding estate taxes by skipping a generation.
