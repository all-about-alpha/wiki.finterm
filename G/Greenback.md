## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: Greenback的发行始于1861年，当时美国联邦政府面临严重的财政危机。为了筹集战争资金，国会通过了《法定货币法案》，授权发行无金银支持的纸币。这些纸币因其绿色背面而被民间称为“Greenback”。  
  **English Explanation**: The issuance of Greenbacks began in 1861 when the U.S. federal government faced a severe financial crisis. To fund the war, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the issuance of paper currency not backed by gold or silver. These notes were colloquially called "Greenbacks" due to their green ink on the back.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: Greenback的发行对美国经济产生了双重影响：一方面缓解了战争资金短缺问题；另一方面导致了通货膨胀和货币贬值。战后，美国政府逐步恢复金本位制，但Greenback作为纸币的先驱，对全球货币体系产生了深远影响。  
  **English Explanation**: The issuance of Greenbacks had a dual impact on the U.S. economy: it alleviated wartime funding shortages but also led to inflation and currency devaluation. After the war, the U.S. gradually returned to the gold standard, but as a pioneer of paper currency, Greenbacks had a lasting influence on global monetary systems.
