# Greater Fool Theory

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “博傻理论”（Greater Fool Theory）是一种投资理论，认为资产的价格可以持续上涨，因为总会有“更大的傻瓜”愿意以更高的价格购买该资产，即使其内在价值已被高估。该理论的核心在于投资者并不关心资产的真实价值，而是依赖于市场情绪和投机行为，认为总会有其他人愿意接盘。这一理论通常与泡沫市场（如股市或房地产）相关。  
  **English Explanation**:  
  The Greater Fool Theory is an investment theory suggesting that the price of an asset can continue to rise because there will always be a "greater fool" willing to buy it at an even higher price, even if the asset is already overvalued. The core idea is that investors are not concerned with the intrinsic value of the asset but rely on market sentiment and speculative behavior, believing that someone else will always be willing to take over the position. This theory is often associated with bubble markets, such as stocks or real estate.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  博傻理论常见于投机性强的市场，如股市、加密货币或房地产市场。投资者在价格快速上涨时，可能会忽视基本面分析，盲目追高，期望在价格崩盘前找到“更大的傻瓜”接盘。然而，这种策略风险极高，一旦市场情绪逆转，最后接盘的投资者将承担巨大损失。  
  **English Application**:  
  The Greater Fool Theory is often observed in highly speculative markets, such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, or real estate. Investors may ignore fundamental analysis during rapid price increases, chasing higher prices in the hope of finding a "greater fool" to take over before the market crashes. However, this strategy carries significant risks, as the last investor to hold the asset may suffer substantial losses if market sentiment reverses.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，博傻理论揭示了市场非理性行为的存在，提醒监管机构加强对投机行为的监控和风险防范。从投资角度看，该理论警示投资者避免盲目跟风，注重资产的内在价值。从行业角度看，博傻理论常被用来解释市场泡沫的形成和破裂机制。  
  **English Significance**:  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Greater Fool Theory highlights the existence of irrational market behavior, prompting regulators to strengthen oversight and risk prevention for speculative activities. From an investment standpoint, the theory warns investors against blindly following trends and emphasizes the importance of intrinsic value. From an industry perspective, the theory is often used to explain the formation and collapse of market bubbles.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  博傻理论的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪初的金融市场，尤其是在1929年美国股市大崩盘前的投机狂潮中得到了充分体现。当时，许多投资者不顾股票的实际价值，盲目追涨，最终导致市场崩盘。此后，这一理论被广泛应用于解释各种市场泡沫现象，如2000年的互联网泡沫和2008年的房地产泡沫。  
  **English Origin**:  
  The concept of the Greater Fool Theory dates back to the early 20th century, particularly during the speculative frenzy leading up to the 1929 stock market crash in the United States. At that time, many investors ignored the actual value of stocks and blindly chased rising prices, ultimately leading to the market crash. Since then, the theory has been widely used to explain various market bubbles, such as the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the housing bubble in 2008.
