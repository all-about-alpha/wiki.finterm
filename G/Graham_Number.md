# Graham Number

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：格雷厄姆数（Graham Number）是由价值投资之父本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）提出的一种估值指标，用于评估股票是否被低估。其核心概念是通过公司的每股收益（EPS）和每股账面价值（BVPS）来计算一个股票的内在价值上限。公式为：√(22.5 × 每股收益 × 每股账面价值)。该指标旨在帮助投资者识别价格低于其内在价值的股票，从而找到潜在的投资机会。  
  - **English Explanation**: The Graham Number is a valuation metric introduced by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, to assess whether a stock is undervalued. Its core concept is to calculate the intrinsic value ceiling of a stock using the company's earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS). The formula is: √(22.5 × EPS × BVPS). This metric aims to help investors identify stocks priced below their intrinsic value, thereby uncovering potential investment opportunities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：格雷厄姆数常用于价值投资策略中，特别是在筛选被市场低估的股票时。投资者可以通过比较股票的当前市场价格与格雷厄姆数，判断其是否具有投资价值。需要注意的是，该指标更适合用于盈利稳定、资产规模较大的公司，对于高成长性或资产较轻的公司可能不适用。此外，投资者应结合其他财务指标和市场环境进行综合分析，避免单一依赖格雷厄姆数。  
  - **English Application**: The Graham Number is commonly used in value investing strategies, particularly when screening for undervalued stocks. Investors can compare a stock's current market price with its Graham Number to determine its investment potential. It is important to note that this metric is more suitable for stable, asset-heavy companies and may not be applicable to high-growth or asset-light firms. Additionally, investors should combine it with other financial metrics and market conditions for comprehensive analysis, avoiding over-reliance on the Graham Number alone.

  - **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，格雷厄姆数为投资者提供了一种简单而有效的估值工具，尤其适合初学者或保守型投资者。它帮助投资者避免支付过高的价格，降低投资风险。同时，该指标也体现了格雷厄姆的价值投资理念，即关注企业的内在价值而非市场情绪，对现代投资理论产生了深远影响。  
  - **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Graham Number provides a simple yet effective valuation tool for investors, particularly beginners or conservative investors.
