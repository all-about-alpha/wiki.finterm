# General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT）是1947年由23个国家签署的一项多边贸易协定，旨在通过降低关税和其他贸易壁垒，促进国际贸易自由化。其核心概念包括非歧视性原则（最惠国待遇和国民待遇）、透明度原则以及通过谈判逐步减少贸易壁垒。GATT为后来的世界贸易组织（WTO）奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a multilateral trade agreement signed in 1947 by 23 nations, aimed at promoting international trade liberalization by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers. Its core principles include non-discrimination (most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment), transparency, and the gradual reduction of trade barriers through negotiations. GATT laid the groundwork for the later establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  GATT主要应用于国际贸易规则的制定和执行，特别是在关税减让、反倾销措施、补贴与反补贴措施等领域。其应用场景包括多边贸易谈判、争端解决机制以及贸易政策审议。需要注意的是，GATT的规则虽然为全球贸易提供了框架，但在实际操作中仍可能面临执行不力或规则被规避的风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  GATT is primarily applied in the formulation and enforcement of international trade rules, particularly in areas such as tariff concessions, anti-dumping measures, and subsidies and countervailing measures. Its application scenarios include multilateral trade negotiations, dispute settlement mechanisms, and trade policy reviews. It is important to note that while GATT provides a framework for global trade, there may still be challenges in enforcement or rule circumvention in practice.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，GATT为全球贸易提供了规则基础，促进了贸易自由化和经济全球化。从投资角度看，GATT降低了跨国贸易成本，为投资者创造了更稳定的贸易环境。从行业角度看，GATT推动了全球供应链的整合，促进了各行业的国际分工与合作。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, GATT provides the foundational rules for global trade, promoting trade liberalization and economic globalization. From an investment perspective, GATT reduces the costs of cross-border trade, creating a more stable trading environment for investors.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  GATT的起源可以追溯到二战后的国际经济重建。1944年布雷顿森林会议确立了战后国际经济秩序的基本框架，但国际贸易规则的制定并未完成。1947年，23个国家在日内瓦签署了GATT，作为国际贸易组织（ITO）成立前的临时协议。然而，ITO因美国国会反对未能成立，GATT成为事实上的国际贸易规则框架，直到1995年被WTO取代。  
  **English Origin**  
  The origin of GATT can be traced back to the post-World War II economic reconstruction. The 1944 Bretton Woods Conference established the basic framework for the post-war international economic order, but the formulation of international trade rules was incomplete. In 1947, 23 nations signed GATT in Geneva as an interim agreement pending the establishment of the International Trade Organization (ITO). However, the ITO failed to materialize due to opposition from the U.S. Congress, and GATT became the de facto framework for international trade rules until it was replaced by the WTO in 1995.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  GATT对全球贸易产生了深远影响。在其存续期间，全球关税水平大幅下降，国际贸易规模显著扩大。GATT的多轮谈判（如肯尼迪回合、东京回合和乌拉圭回合）推动了贸易自由化进程，并为WTO的成立奠定了基础。尽管GATT已被WTO取代，但其原则和规则仍在全球贸易体系中发挥重要作用。  
  **English Impact**  
  GATT had a profound impact on global trade. During its existence, global tariff levels significantly decreased, and the scale of international trade expanded substantially. The multiple rounds of GATT negotiations (such as the Kennedy Round, Tokyo Round, and Uruguay Round) advanced trade liberalization and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the WTO. Although GATT has been replaced by the WTO, its principles and rules continue to play a vital role in the global trading system.
