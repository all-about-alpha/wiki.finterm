# Golden Handcuffs / 金手铐

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **金手铐** 是一种激励机制，通常由公司设计，旨在通过提供丰厚的财务奖励或长期福利来留住关键员工。这些奖励通常以股票期权、奖金或递延薪酬的形式发放，但员工只有在满足特定条件（如继续在公司工作一定年限）后才能获得。  
  **Golden Handcuffs** is an incentive mechanism typically designed by companies to retain key employees by offering substantial financial rewards or long-term benefits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文应用场景中，金手铐常见于高科技、金融等高薪行业，用于防止核心人才被竞争对手挖走。然而，这种机制也可能导致员工因过度依赖奖励而失去职业灵活性，甚至产生“被束缚”的感觉。
