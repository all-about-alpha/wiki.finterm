## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：赠与信（Gift Letter）是一种书面文件，通常由赠与人（如父母或亲属）出具，声明其向受赠人（如子女或亲友）提供一笔资金作为赠与，而非贷款。赠与信的核心概念在于明确资金的赠与性质，避免受赠人在未来承担还款义务。赠与信在房地产交易、税务申报等场景中尤为重要，用于证明资金来源的合法性。  
  **English Explanation**: A Gift Letter is a written document, typically issued by a donor (such as a parent or relative), stating that they are providing a sum of money as a gift to the recipient (such as a child or friend), rather than a loan. The core concept of a Gift Letter is to clarify the nature of the funds as a gift, ensuring that the recipient is not obligated to repay the amount in the future. Gift Letters are particularly important in real estate transactions and tax filings, as they serve to prove the legitimacy of the source of funds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：赠与信常用于购房场景，尤其是当购房者首付款部分或全部来自亲属赠与时。银行或贷款机构通常要求提供赠与信，以确保资金并非贷款，从而不影响购房者的债务负担能力。此外，赠与信也可用于税务申报，证明资金的赠与性质以避免税务纠纷。需要注意的是，赠与信必须明确金额、赠与人和受赠人信息，并签署日期，以确保法律效力。  
  **English Application**: Gift Letters are commonly used in real estate transactions, particularly when a portion or all of the down payment comes from a relative's gift. Banks or lenders often require a Gift Letter to ensure that the funds are not a loan, thereby not affecting the borrower's debt-to-income ratio. Additionally, Gift Letters can be used in tax filings to prove the nature of the funds as a gift, avoiding potential tax disputes. It is important to note that a Gift Letter must clearly state the amount, the donor and recipient's information, and be dated to ensure legal validity.

  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，赠与信是证明资金来源合法性的重要文件，有助于防止洗钱等非法活动。从投资角度看，赠与信可以降低购房者的债务负担，提高贷款审批通过率。从行业角度看，赠与信的使用规范了资金流动，促进了房地产市场的健康发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, a Gift Letter is a crucial document for proving the legitimacy of fund sources, helping to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering. From an investment standpoint, a Gift Letter can reduce the borrower's debt burden and increase the likelihood of loan approval. From an industry perspective, the use of Gift Letters standardizes fund flows and promotes the healthy development of the real estate market.
