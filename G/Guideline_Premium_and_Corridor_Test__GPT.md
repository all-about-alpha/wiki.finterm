# Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 指导保费与走廊测试（GPT）是美国国税局（IRS）用于确定人寿保险保单是否符合税收优惠资格的一种测试方法。该测试通过比较保单的保费支付与死亡赔偿金的比例，确保保单不被滥用为投资工具。核心概念包括“指导保费”和“走廊”，前者是IRS规定的最高保费限额，后者是死亡赔偿金与现金价值之间的最低比例要求。  
  **English Explanation**: The Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT) is a method used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine whether a life insurance policy qualifies for tax benefits. The test compares the premium payments of the policy to the death benefit ratio, ensuring that the policy is not misused as an investment tool. Key concepts include "guideline premium," which is the maximum premium limit set by the IRS, and "corridor," which is the minimum ratio required between the death benefit and cash value.

  **中文解释**: GPT起源于1984年美国《税收改革法案》（Tax Reform Act），该法案旨在规范人寿保险的税收优惠政策。在此之前，部分保险公司设计的高现金价值保单被用作避税工具，导致税收流失。GPT的引入填补了这一监管空白，明确了人寿保险的税收资格标准。  
  **English Explanation**: The GPT originated from the Tax Reform Act of 1984 in the United States, which aimed to regulate tax benefits for life insurance.

The introduction of GPT addressed this regulatory gap by clarifying eligibility criteria for life insurance taxation.
