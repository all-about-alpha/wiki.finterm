## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：普通合伙企业（General Partnership）是指由两个或两个以上的合伙人共同出资、共同经营、共享利润、共担风险的企业组织形式。在这种合伙形式中，所有合伙人对企业的债务承担无限连带责任。普通合伙企业通常适用于小型企业或专业服务机构，如律师事务所、会计师事务所等。

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：普通合伙企业广泛应用于小型企业、家族企业或专业服务领域。合伙人通常基于信任和共同目标建立合作关系。然而，由于合伙人需承担无限连带责任，风险较高，因此在选择合伙人时需谨慎。此外，普通合伙企业的税务处理较为灵活，利润直接分配给合伙人，由合伙人缴纳个人所得税。  
  **English Explanation**: General partnerships are widely used in small businesses, family-owned enterprises, or professional service industries. Partners typically establish the partnership based on trust and shared goals.
