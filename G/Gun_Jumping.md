  **English Explanation**: Gun Jumping refers to the act of prematurely disclosing information or engaging in transactions related to securities issuance or mergers and acquisitions before obtaining formal regulatory approval. This behavior typically violates securities laws or antitrust regulations and may result in legal penalties.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在IPO（首次公开募股）过程中，公司若在未获得证监会批准前提前发布招股说明书或进行路演，即构成Gun Jumping。此外，在并购交易中，买方若在未通过反垄断审查前提前整合业务或共享敏感信息，也可能被视为Gun Jumping。风险在于可能面临监管机构的罚款、交易被叫停甚至刑事责任。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: In the context of an IPO (Initial Public Offering), if a company releases a prospectus or conducts roadshows before obtaining approval from the securities regulator, it constitutes Gun Jumping. Similarly, in M&A transactions, if the buyer integrates businesses or shares sensitive information before passing antitrust reviews, it may also be considered Gun Jumping. The risks include potential fines from regulators, suspension of transactions, and even criminal liability.
