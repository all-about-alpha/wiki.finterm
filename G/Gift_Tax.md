## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：赠与税（Gift Tax）是指对个人或实体在无偿转让财产或资产时征收的一种税。赠与税的征收对象通常是赠与人（即财产提供者），而非受赠人。其核心概念在于防止个人通过赠与方式规避遗产税或其他税务责任。赠与税的起源可以追溯到20世纪初的美国，旨在确保财富转移的公平性和税收完整性。  
  **English Explanation**: Gift Tax is a tax levied on the transfer of property or assets from one individual or entity to another without receiving full value in return. The tax is typically imposed on the donor (the person giving the gift) rather than the recipient. The core concept of Gift Tax is to prevent individuals from avoiding estate taxes or other tax liabilities through gifting. Its origins trace back to the early 20th century in the United States, aiming to ensure fairness and tax integrity in wealth transfers.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：赠与税主要适用于高净值个人或家庭在进行大额财产赠与时。例如，父母将房产或股票赠与子女时，可能需要缴纳赠与税。在中国，虽然没有明确的赠与税，但类似的规定体现在个人所得税和财产转让税中。需要注意的是，赠与税的计算通常基于赠与财产的市场价值，且可能存在年度免税额或终身免税额。  
  **English Application**: Gift Tax primarily applies to high-net-worth individuals or families when making large asset transfers. For example, when parents gift real estate or stocks to their children, they may be subject to Gift Tax. In China, while there is no explicit Gift Tax, similar regulations are reflected in personal income tax and property transfer taxes. It is important to note that Gift Tax calculations are typically based on the market value of the gifted property, and there may be annual or lifetime exemptions.
