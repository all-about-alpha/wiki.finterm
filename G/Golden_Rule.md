  **English Application**: In finance, the Golden Rule is often used to guide investment decisions and corporate management. For example, investors should focus on the long-term value of a company rather than short-term stock price fluctuations; corporate management should consider the long-term interests of shareholders, employees, and society when formulating strategies. It is important to note that excessive pursuit of short-term gains may lead to risk accumulation.
