# Goal-Based Investing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：目标导向投资（Goal-Based Investing）是一种以投资者个人财务目标为核心的投资策略。它强调根据投资者的具体目标（如退休、购房、子女教育等）来制定投资计划，而非单纯追求市场回报。这一概念由行为金融学家和财富管理专家提出，核心在于将投资与人生目标紧密结合，通过定制化的资产配置和风险管理来实现目标。  
  **English Explanation**: Goal-Based Investing is an investment strategy centered around an individual's financial goals. It emphasizes creating investment plans tailored to specific objectives (e.g., retirement, buying a home, funding education) rather than solely chasing market returns. This concept, introduced by behavioral finance experts and wealth management professionals, focuses on aligning investments with life goals through customized asset allocation and risk management.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：目标导向投资广泛应用于个人财富管理领域，尤其适用于有明确财务目标的投资者。例如，为退休储蓄的投资者可能会选择低风险、稳定收益的投资组合，而为子女教育储蓄的投资者可能会选择中等风险、长期增长潜力的资产。需要注意的是，目标导向投资要求投资者定期评估目标进展，并根据市场变化调整策略。  
  **English Explanation**: Goal-Based Investing is widely applied in personal wealth management, particularly for investors with clear financial objectives. For instance, an investor saving for retirement might opt for a low-risk, stable-return portfolio, while one saving for a child's education might choose medium-risk assets with long-term growth potential. It is important to note that Goal-Based Investing requires regular assessment of goal progress and strategy adjustments based on market conditions.

  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Goal-Based Investing enhances investor protection by reducing risks associated with blindly chasing high returns.
