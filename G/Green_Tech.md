# Green Tech

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **绿色科技（Green Tech）** 是指通过创新技术手段减少对环境的负面影响，促进可持续发展的技术领域。其核心概念包括节能减排、资源循环利用、清洁能源开发等。  
  **Green Tech** refers to the field of technology that aims to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable development through innovative means. Its core concepts include energy conservation, resource recycling, and clean energy development.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，绿色科技广泛应用于新能源（如太阳能、风能）、电动汽车、智能电网、环保材料等领域。需要注意的是，绿色科技的推广可能面临技术成本高、市场接受度低等风险。  
  In China, Green Tech is widely applied in areas such as new energy (e.g., solar, wind), electric vehicles, smart grids, and eco-friendly materials. However, its promotion may face risks such as high technological costs and low market acceptance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，绿色科技是中国实现“双碳目标”（碳达峰、碳中和）的重要工具；从投资角度看，绿色科技是未来经济增长的新引擎；从行业角度看，它推动了传统产业的转型升级。  
  From a regulatory perspective, Green Tech is a crucial tool for China to achieve its "dual carbon goals" (carbon peak and neutrality). From an investment perspective, it is a new engine for future economic growth. From an industry perspective, it drives the transformation and upgrading of traditional sectors.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  绿色科技的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代的全球环境运动，当时人们开始关注工业发展对环境的破坏。1992年联合国环境与发展大会（里约地球峰会）进一步推动了绿色科技的发展。中国在21世纪初将绿色发展纳入国家战略，成为全球绿色科技的重要参与者。  
  The origin of Green Tech can be traced back to the global environmental movement in the 1970s when people began to focus on the environmental damage caused by industrial development. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Rio Earth Summit) further promoted its development. China incorporated green development into its national strategy in the early 21st century, becoming a key player in global Green Tech.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，绿色科技推动了新能源产业的快速发展，如光伏和风电装机容量位居世界前列。同时，它也促进了环保法规的完善和公众环保意识的提升。在全球范围内，绿色科技已成为应对气候变化和能源危机的重要手段。  
  In China, Green Tech has driven the rapid development of the new energy industry, with solar and wind power capacities leading globally. It has also promoted the improvement of environmental regulations and public awareness. Globally, Green Tech has become a vital tool for addressing climate change and energy crises.
