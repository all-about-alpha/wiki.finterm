  “私有化”（Going Private）是指一家上市公司通过收购或回购股份的方式，从公开市场退市，转变为私有公司。这一过程通常由公司管理层、私募股权公司或大股东发起，目的是减少监管压力、提高经营灵活性或进行战略重组。私有化的核心概念包括股份回购、退市和公司控制权的集中。  
  **English Explanation**:  
  "Going Private" refers to the process by which a publicly traded company is delisted from the stock market and converted into a private company through share buybacks or acquisitions. This process is typically initiated by the company's management, private equity firms, or major shareholders, aiming to reduce regulatory pressures, enhance operational flexibility, or undertake strategic restructuring. Key concepts include share repurchases, delisting, and the concentration of corporate control.

  2. 公司希望减少公开市场的监管成本和信息披露压力。  
  3. 私募股权公司通过杠杆收购（LBO）进行私有化，以重组公司并未来重新上市获利。

  **English Application**:  
  Going private is typically applied in the following scenarios:  
  1. When a company's valuation is undervalued by the market, and management or major shareholders believe that privatization can better realize the company's value.

  3. When private equity firms use leveraged buyouts (LBOs) to privatize a company, restructure it, and potentially relist it for profit in the future.  
  It is important to note that privatization may face risks such as financing difficulties, shareholder opposition, and regulatory scrutiny.
