# Prisoner's Dilemma

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **囚徒困境** 是博弈论中的一个经典模型，由数学家阿尔伯特·W·塔克（Albert W. Tucker）于1950年正式提出。它描述了两个理性个体在合作与背叛之间的选择困境：即使合作对双方更有利，但由于缺乏信任和担心被对方背叛，双方可能选择不合作，导致次优结果。  
  **The Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic model in game theory, formally introduced by mathematician Albert W. Tucker in 1950. It describes a situation where two rational individuals face a dilemma between cooperation and betrayal: even though cooperation would benefit both, the lack of trust and fear of being betrayed by the other party may lead both to choose non-cooperation, resulting in a suboptimal outcome.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在经济学中，囚徒困境被广泛应用于分析市场竞争、价格战、公共资源分配等问题。例如，两家竞争企业可能因担心对方降价而选择同时降价，最终导致利润下降。在金融领域，投资者可能因担心他人抛售而提前抛售资产，引发市场恐慌。  
  In economics, the Prisoner's Dilemma is widely used to analyze market competition, price wars, and public resource allocation. For example, two competing firms may choose to lower prices simultaneously due to fear of the other doing so, ultimately leading to reduced profits. In finance, investors may sell assets prematurely due to fear of others selling, triggering market panic.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  囚徒困境揭示了个人理性选择与集体利益之间的矛盾，对政策制定、市场监管和合作机制设计具有重要启示。它帮助理解为什么在某些情况下需要外部干预（如法律或协议）来促进合作。  
  The Prisoner's Dilemma highlights the conflict between individual rational choices and collective interests, offering important insights for policy-making, market regulation, and the design of cooperative mechanisms. It helps explain why external interventions (such as laws or agreements) are sometimes necessary to foster cooperation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  囚徒困境的概念最早由梅里尔·弗勒德（Merrill Flood）和梅尔文·德雷舍（Melvin Dresher）在1950年提出，后由阿尔伯特·W·塔克以“囚徒”故事的形式普及。故事中，两名犯罪嫌疑人被分开审讯，面临坦白或沉默的选择，最终因缺乏信任而选择坦白，导致更长的刑期。  
  The concept of the Prisoner's Dilemma was first proposed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950 and later popularized by Albert W. Tucker using the "prisoner" story. In the story, two suspects are interrogated separately and face the choice of confessing or remaining silent. Due to a lack of trust, both choose to confess, resulting in longer sentences.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  囚徒困境对博弈论、经济学、政治学和社会学产生了深远影响。它不仅解释了市场竞争中的非理性行为，还被用于分析国际关系、环境保护和公共政策等领域。如今，它已成为理解合作与冲突的核心工具之一。  
  The Prisoner's Dilemma has had a profound impact on game theory, economics, political science, and sociology. It not only explains irrational behavior in market competition but is also used to analyze international relations, environmental protection, and public policy. Today, it is one of the core tools for understanding cooperation and conflict.
