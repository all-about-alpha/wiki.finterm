# Price Controls

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **价格控制** 是指政府或相关机构通过法律或行政手段对商品或服务的价格进行直接干预，以限制其上涨或下跌的行为。其核心目的是稳定市场、防止通货膨胀或通货紧缩，并保护消费者和生产者的利益。  
  **Price controls** refer to the direct intervention by governments or relevant authorities through legal or administrative measures to limit the rise or fall of prices of goods or services. The core purpose is to stabilize markets, prevent inflation or deflation, and protect the interests of consumers and producers.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，价格控制常用于民生必需品（如食品、能源）和公共服务（如医疗、教育）领域，以确保社会稳定和公平。然而，过度依赖价格控制可能导致市场扭曲、供应短缺和黑市交易等风险。  
  In China, price controls are often applied to essential goods (e.g., food, energy) and public services (e.g., healthcare, education) to ensure social stability and fairness. However, over-reliance on price controls may lead to market distortions, supply shortages, and black-market activities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，价格控制是政府调控经济的重要手段之一；从投资角度看，它可能影响企业利润和市场预期；从行业角度看，它有助于维护特定行业的稳定发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, price controls are a key tool for governments to manage the economy; from an investment perspective, they may impact corporate profits and market expectations; from an industry perspective, they help maintain stable development in specific sectors.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  价格控制的历史可以追溯到古代中国，如汉朝时期的“平准法”，旨在通过调节物价来稳定经济。现代意义上的价格控制则起源于20世纪初的经济危机时期，如美国在二战期间实施的物价管制政策。  
  The history of price controls dates back to ancient China, such as the "Pingzhun Law" during the Han Dynasty, which aimed to stabilize the economy by regulating prices. Modern price controls originated during economic crises in the early 20th century, such as the price control policies implemented in the United States during World War II.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，价格控制在计划经济时期发挥了重要作用，但在市场经济改革后逐渐减少。目前，它主要用于应对突发事件（如自然灾害）或特定行业（如房地产）的调控。在全球范围内，价格控制在应对通货膨胀或经济危机时仍被广泛采用。  
  In China, price controls played a significant role during the planned economy era but gradually diminished after market-oriented reforms. Currently, they are mainly used to address emergencies (e.g., natural disasters) or regulate specific industries (e.g., real estate). Globally, price controls are still widely adopted in response to inflation or economic crises.
