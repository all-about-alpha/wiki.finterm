# Personal Guarantee

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：个人担保（Personal Guarantee）是指个人（通常是企业主或高管）为企业的债务或义务提供的一种担保形式。担保人承诺在企业无法履行债务时，由其个人资产承担偿还责任。这种担保方式常见于中小企业贷款或商业合同中，旨在增强债权人的信心。  
  **English Explanation**: A Personal Guarantee is a form of guarantee provided by an individual (usually a business owner or executive) for the debts or obligations of a business. The guarantor promises to assume responsibility for repayment using personal assets if the business fails to fulfill its obligations. This type of guarantee is commonly used in small business loans or commercial contracts to enhance creditor confidence.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：个人担保广泛应用于中小企业融资、商业租赁、供应商合同等场景。例如，企业主在申请银行贷款时，银行可能要求其签署个人担保协议，以确保贷款安全。需要注意的是，个人担保具有高风险性，一旦企业违约，担保人可能面临资产被追偿的风险。  
  **English Application**: Personal guarantees are widely used in scenarios such as small business financing, commercial leasing, and supplier contracts. For example, when a business owner applies for a bank loan, the bank may require them to sign a personal guarantee agreement to secure the loan. It is important to note that personal guarantees carry high risks; if the business defaults, the guarantor may face asset recovery actions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，个人担保有助于降低金融机构的信贷风险；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了额外的保障；从行业角度看，它促进了中小企业的融资活动。然而，过度依赖个人担保可能导致企业主承担过高的财务压力。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, personal guarantees help reduce credit risks for financial institutions; from an investment perspective, they provide additional security for investors; from an industry perspective, they facilitate financing activities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, over-reliance on personal guarantees can lead to excessive financial pressure on business owners.
