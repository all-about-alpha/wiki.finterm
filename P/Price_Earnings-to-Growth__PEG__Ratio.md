# Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：市盈率相对盈利增长比率（PEG Ratio）是由投资大师彼得·林奇（Peter Lynch）提出的一种估值指标，用于衡量股票的价格与其盈利增长之间的关系。其核心概念是将市盈率（P/E Ratio）与公司的盈利增长率（Earnings Growth Rate）相结合，以评估股票是否被高估或低估。公式为：PEG Ratio = (P/E Ratio) / (Earnings Growth Rate)。  
  **English Explanation**: The Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio, introduced by investment guru Peter Lynch, is a valuation metric that measures the relationship between a stock's price and its earnings growth. The core concept combines the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio with the company's earnings growth rate to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. The formula is: PEG Ratio = (P/E Ratio) / (Earnings Growth Rate).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：PEG比率广泛应用于股票投资分析中，特别是在成长型股票的估值中。投资者通常认为，当PEG比率小于1时，股票可能被低估；大于1时，可能被高估。然而，该指标依赖于对未来盈利增长的预测，因此存在一定的不确定性和风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The PEG Ratio is widely used in stock investment analysis, particularly in valuing growth stocks. Investors generally consider a stock potentially undervalued if the PEG Ratio is less than 1 and overvalued if it exceeds 1. However, this metric relies on forecasts of future earnings growth, introducing uncertainty and risk.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，PEG比率提供了一种更全面的估值方法，弥补了传统市盈率的不足。它帮助投资者识别具有高增长潜力的公司，同时避免过度依赖单一指标带来的误判。在行业分析中，PEG比率也被用于比较不同公司的成长性和估值水平。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the PEG Ratio offers a more comprehensive valuation method, addressing the limitations of traditional P/E Ratios. It helps investors identify companies with high growth potential while avoiding misjudgments from over-reliance on a single metric. In industry analysis, the PEG Ratio is also used to compare the growth and valuation levels of different companies.
