# Portfolio Runoff

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：投资组合流失（Portfolio Runoff）是指投资组合中的资产或负债逐渐到期、偿还或减少，而未被新资产或负债所替代的过程。这一概念通常用于描述金融机构（如银行或保险公司）的资产或负债自然减少的情况。核心概念包括资产的到期、负债的偿还以及再投资策略的缺失。  
  **English Explanation**: Portfolio runoff refers to the gradual reduction of assets or liabilities in a portfolio as they mature, are repaid, or diminish without being replaced by new assets or liabilities.

Key concepts include asset maturity, liability repayment, and the absence of reinvestment strategies.

  **English Application**: In banking, portfolio runoff is often used to describe the gradual repayment of loans in a loan portfolio without replacement by new loans.
