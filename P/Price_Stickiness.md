# Price Stickiness

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **价格粘性**（Price Stickiness）是指商品或服务的价格在面临市场供需变化时，不能迅速调整的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）提出，核心在于价格调整的滞后性，通常由菜单成本、合同约束或市场预期等因素导致。  
  **Price Stickiness** refers to the phenomenon where the prices of goods or services do not adjust quickly in response to changes in market supply and demand. This concept was first introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes, emphasizing the lag in price adjustments, often caused by menu costs, contractual constraints, or market expectations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在宏观经济中，价格粘性解释了为什么短期内经济波动难以通过价格机制自我调节。例如，在经济衰退时，企业可能因成本或合同限制无法立即降价，导致需求持续低迷。投资者需关注价格粘性对通胀、货币政策及企业盈利的影响。  
  In macroeconomics, price stickiness explains why short-term economic fluctuations are difficult to self-correct through price mechanisms. For instance, during a recession, businesses may be unable to lower prices immediately due to costs or contractual constraints, leading to prolonged weak demand. Investors should pay attention to the impact of price stickiness on inflation, monetary policy, and corporate profits.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，理解价格粘性有助于制定更有效的货币政策；从投资角度看，它影响资产定价和风险管理；从行业角度看，企业需灵活应对价格调整的滞后性以保持竞争力。  
  From a regulatory perspective, understanding price stickiness helps formulate more effective monetary policies; from an investment perspective, it influences asset pricing and risk management; from an industry perspective, businesses need to adapt flexibly to the lag in price adjustments to maintain competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  价格粘性的概念源于20世纪30年代的大萧条时期。凯恩斯在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中首次提出这一理论，用于解释为何经济衰退期间工资和物价未能迅速下降以恢复均衡。此后，新凯恩斯学派进一步发展了这一理论，引入了菜单成本、不完全竞争等微观基础。  
  The concept of price stickiness originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Keynes first introduced this theory in his work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money* to explain why wages and prices did not fall quickly during economic recessions to restore equilibrium. Later, the New Keynesian School further developed this theory by introducing microeconomic foundations such as menu costs and imperfect competition.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  价格粘性理论对现代宏观经济政策产生了深远影响。它解释了为何货币政策在短期内更为有效，也为政府干预经济提供了理论依据。如今，这一概念广泛应用于通胀预测、货币政策制定及企业定价策略中。  
  The theory of price stickiness has had a profound impact on modern macroeconomic policies. It explains why monetary policy is more effective in the short term and provides a theoretical basis for government intervention in the economy. Today, this concept is widely applied in inflation forecasting, monetary policy formulation, and corporate pricing strategies.
