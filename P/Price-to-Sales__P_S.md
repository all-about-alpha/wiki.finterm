# Price-to-Sales (P/S)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：市销率（Price-to-Sales Ratio，简称P/S）是一种估值指标，用于衡量公司股票价格与其销售收入之间的关系。其计算公式为：市销率 = 公司市值 / 总销售收入。该指标由投资者和分析师广泛使用，特别是在评估尚未盈利或盈利不稳定的公司时。  
  **English Explanation**: The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S) is a valuation metric that measures the relationship between a company's stock price and its sales revenue. It is calculated as: P/S Ratio = Market Capitalization / Total Sales Revenue. This metric is widely used by investors and analysts, particularly when evaluating companies that are not yet profitable or have unstable earnings.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：市销率常用于评估高增长行业（如科技、生物技术）中的公司，因为这些公司可能在早期阶段尚未实现盈利。此外，它也被用于比较同行业公司的估值水平。需要注意的是，市销率忽略了公司的盈利能力、负债水平和现金流状况，因此应与其他财务指标结合使用。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: The P/S ratio is often used to evaluate companies in high-growth industries (e.g., technology, biotechnology) that may not yet be profitable in their early stages. It is also used to compare valuation levels among companies within the same industry. However, it should be noted that the P/S ratio does not account for a company's profitability, debt levels, or cash flow, so it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从投资角度来看，市销率为投资者提供了一个相对简单的工具来评估公司的市场价值与其销售收入的匹配程度。在监管层面，该指标有助于识别市场中的潜在泡沫或低估现象。在行业分析中，市销率是衡量公司竞争力和市场地位的重要参考之一。  
  **English Significance**: From an investment perspective, the P/S ratio provides investors with a relatively simple tool to assess how well a company's market value aligns with its sales revenue. At the regulatory level, this metric helps identify potential market bubbles or undervaluations. In industry analysis, the P/S ratio serves as an important reference for evaluating a company's competitiveness and market position.
