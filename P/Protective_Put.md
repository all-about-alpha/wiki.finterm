# Protective Put

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **保护性看跌期权**是一种投资策略，投资者在持有标的资产（如股票）的同时，购买看跌期权，以对冲潜在的下跌风险。该策略的核心在于通过支付期权费，确保标的资产价格下跌时，损失被限制在一定范围内。  
  A **protective put** is an investment strategy where an investor holds the underlying asset (e.g., stock) and simultaneously purchases a put option to hedge against potential downside risk. The core concept is to limit losses within a certain range by paying the option premium if the price of the underlying asset falls.

* **应用 / Application**  
  该策略常用于股票投资者在市场不确定性较高时，保护其投资组合免受大幅下跌的影响。例如，当投资者预期市场可能回调但又不愿卖出股票时，可通过购买看跌期权锁定最低卖出价格。需要注意的是，期权费会增加投资成本。  
  This strategy is often used by stock investors to protect their portfolios from significant declines during periods of high market uncertainty. For example, when investors anticipate a market correction but are unwilling to sell their stocks, they can purchase put options to lock in a minimum selling price. It’s important to note that the option premium increases investment costs.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从投资角度来看，保护性看跌期权为投资者提供了一种有效的风险管理工具，尤其适用于波动性较大的市场环境。从监管和行业角度来看，该策略有助于稳定市场情绪，减少恐慌性抛售。  
  From an investment perspective, protective puts provide an effective risk management tool, especially in highly volatile markets. From regulatory and industry perspectives, this strategy helps stabilize market sentiment and reduce panic selling.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  The concept of protective puts originated in the 1970s with the rise of the U.S. options market. Following the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973, standardized options trading became widespread, and investors gradually recognized the value of using put options for hedging risks.

* **影响 / Impact**
