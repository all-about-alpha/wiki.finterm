## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  **中文解释**：政治风险是指由于政府政策、法规、政治事件或社会动荡等因素，导致企业或投资者在特定国家或地区面临的经济损失或不确定性。这种风险通常与政权更迭、战争、恐怖主义、贸易制裁等事件相关。  
  **English Explanation**: Political risk refers to the potential for financial loss or uncertainty faced by businesses or investors in a specific country or region due to government policies, regulations, political events, or social unrest. This risk is often associated with events such as regime changes, wars, terrorism, and trade sanctions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：政治风险在国际投资、跨国企业运营和国际贸易中尤为突出。例如，企业在进入新兴市场时，可能面临政府政策突变的风险；在战乱地区投资时，可能遭遇资产被没收或破坏的风险。投资者需通过风险评估工具和保险来规避此类风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Political risk is particularly prominent in international investments, multinational operations, and global trade. For instance, companies entering emerging markets may face sudden policy changes by the government; investments in conflict zones may encounter asset seizures or destruction. Investors need to use risk assessment tools and insurance to mitigate such risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，政治风险是跨国企业合规管理的重要组成部分；从投资角度看，它是资产配置和风险管理的关键因素；从行业角度看，能源、矿业等对政策依赖度高的行业尤其需要关注政治风险。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, political risk is a crucial component of compliance management for multinational corporations; from an investment perspective, it is a key factor in asset allocation and risk management; from an industry perspective, sectors like energy and mining that are highly dependent on policies must pay special attention to political risk.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：政治风险的概念最早可追溯到20世纪中叶的冷战时期，当时东西方阵营的对峙导致国际投资环境高度不稳定。1970年代石油危机后，跨国公司开始系统性地评估政治风险。1980年代，随着全球化加速，政治风险管理逐渐成为一门独立学科。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of political risk can be traced back to the mid-20th century during the Cold War when the confrontation between Eastern and Western blocs created a highly unstable international investment environment. After the oil crisis of the 1970s, multinational corporations began systematically assessing political risks. In the 1980s, with accelerated globalization, political risk management gradually became an independent discipline.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：政治风险对全球经济格局产生了深远影响。例如，2014年克里米亚危机导致西方国家对俄罗斯实施经济制裁，许多跨国企业因此蒙受损失。近年来，“一带一路”倡议中的中国企业也面临沿线国家的政治不确定性挑战。  
  **English Impact**: Political risk has had a profound impact on the global economic landscape. For example, the Crimea crisis in 2014 led to economic sanctions against Russia by Western countries, causing significant losses for many multinational corporations. In recent years, Chinese companies involved in the Belt and Road Initiative have also faced political uncertainties in countries along the route.
