## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  铂金（Platinum）是一种稀有的贵金属，化学符号为Pt，原子序数78。它以其高密度、耐腐蚀性和独特的银白色光泽而闻名。铂金在地壳中的含量极低，开采和提炼过程复杂，因此具有很高的经济价值。铂金最早由西班牙探险家在16世纪发现，并在18世纪被科学家正式识别和命名。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Platinum is a rare precious metal with the chemical symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is known for its high density, corrosion resistance, and distinctive silvery-white luster. Platinum is extremely scarce in the Earth's crust, and its mining and refining processes are complex, making it highly valuable economically. It was first discovered by Spanish explorers in the 16th century and formally identified and named by scientists in the 18th century.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  铂金广泛应用于珠宝制造、汽车催化转换器、电子设备、化工催化剂以及医疗设备等领域。由于其耐腐蚀性和稳定性，铂金在工业中扮演着重要角色。然而，铂金价格波动较大，投资需谨慎。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Platinum is widely used in jewelry manufacturing, automotive catalytic converters, electronic devices, chemical catalysts, and medical equipment. Due to its corrosion resistance and stability, platinum plays a crucial role in industrial applications. However, its price is highly volatile, requiring cautious investment.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**  
  从监管角度看，铂金被视为重要的战略资源，许多国家对其开采和贸易进行严格管控。从投资角度看，铂金是避险资产之一，常用于对冲通胀和经济不确定性。从行业角度看，铂金在环保技术（如催化转换器）中的应用推动了绿色经济的发展。  
  **English Explanation**  
  From a regulatory perspective, platinum is considered a critical strategic resource, with many countries imposing strict controls on its mining and trade. From an investment standpoint, platinum serves as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. From an industry perspective, its use in environmental technologies (e.g., catalytic converters) drives the growth of the green economy.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**  
  铂金的历史可以追溯到古代南美洲，当地印第安人曾使用铂金制作饰品。16世纪，西班牙探险家在南美洲发现了铂金，但误以为它是一种未成熟的银。直到18世纪，科学家才确认铂金为一种独立的金属元素。1751年，瑞典科学家谢勒（Henrik Scheffer）首次对铂金进行了详细研究。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The history of platinum dates back to ancient South America, where indigenous people used it to make ornaments. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers discovered platinum in South America but mistakenly thought it was an immature form of silver. It wasn't until the 18th century that scientists recognized platinum as a distinct metallic element. In 1751, Swedish scientist Henrik Scheffer conducted the first detailed study of platinum.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**  
  铂金的发现和应用对全球工业和科技产生了深远影响。例如，铂金催化转换器的发明显著减少了汽车尾气排放，推动了环保技术的发展。目前，南非是全球最大的铂金生产国，占全球供应量的70%以上。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The discovery and application of platinum have had a profound impact on global industry and technology. For instance, the invention of platinum catalytic converters has significantly reduced vehicle emissions, advancing environmental technologies. Currently, South Africa is the largest producer of platinum, accounting for over 70% of global supply.
