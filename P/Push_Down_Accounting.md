# Push Down Accounting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Push Down Accounting（下推会计）是一种会计处理方法，主要应用于企业并购中。当一家公司被收购后，收购方将收购成本“下推”到被收购公司的财务报表中，重新调整被收购公司的资产和负债的账面价值，以反映其公允价值。这一方法通常在被收购公司成为收购方的全资子公司时使用。  
  **English Explanation**: Push Down Accounting is an accounting method primarily used in business acquisitions. When a company is acquired, the acquirer "pushes down" the acquisition cost to the acquired company's financial statements, adjusting the book value of its assets and liabilities to reflect their fair value. This method is typically applied when the acquired company becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of the acquirer.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：下推会计常用于企业并购后的财务整合，特别是在被收购公司成为全资子公司的情况下。它有助于更准确地反映被收购公司的财务状况和经营成果。然而，需要注意的是，下推会计可能会影响被收购公司的税务负担和财务报表的可比性。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Push Down Accounting is often used in financial integration post-acquisition, especially when the acquired company becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary. It helps to more accurately reflect the financial condition and operating results of the acquired company. However, it should be noted that Push Down Accounting may impact the tax burden and comparability of financial statements of the acquired company.
