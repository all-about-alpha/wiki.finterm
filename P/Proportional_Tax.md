# Proportional Tax

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  比例税是一种税收制度，无论纳税人的收入或财富水平如何，都按照相同的税率征税。其核心概念是“统一税率”，即所有纳税人按相同比例缴纳所得税。  
  A proportional tax is a tax system where the same tax rate is applied to all taxpayers, regardless of their income or wealth level. The core concept is a "flat rate," meaning all taxpayers pay the same percentage of their income.

* **应用 / Application**  
  比例税常用于简化税收系统，减少税务管理的复杂性。例如，某些国家或地区对个人或企业征收统一税率所得税。然而，这种税收制度可能对低收入群体造成较大负担，因为其税后收入占比更高。  
  Proportional taxes are often used to simplify tax systems and reduce administrative complexity. For example, some countries or regions impose a flat income tax rate on individuals or businesses. However, this system may place a heavier burden on low-income groups, as the tax takes a larger proportion of their disposable income.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，比例税有助于提高税收透明度和公平性；从投资角度看，稳定的税率可吸引长期投资；从行业角度看，简化税务流程可降低企业运营成本。  
  From a regulatory perspective, proportional taxes enhance transparency and fairness in taxation; from an investment perspective, stable tax rates attract long-term investments; from an industry perspective, simplified tax processes reduce operational costs for businesses.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  比例税的概念可以追溯到古代文明，如古罗马的“十分之一税”（Decima），即对所有收入征收10%的税。现代比例税的实践始于20世纪初期，部分国家为简化税收系统而引入统一税率制度。  
  The concept of proportional taxation dates back to ancient civilizations, such as Rome's "Decima," which imposed a 10% tax on all income. Modern proportional taxation began in the early 20th century when some countries introduced flat-rate systems to simplify their tax structures.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  比例税在全球范围内被部分国家和地区采用，如俄罗斯和香港特别行政区。它在一定程度上促进了经济增长和税务效率提升，但也因对低收入群体的不公平性而受到批评。  
  Proportional taxes have been adopted by some countries and regions worldwide, such as Russia and Hong Kong SAR. While they have contributed to economic growth and improved tax efficiency, they have also faced criticism for being unfair to low-income groups.
