# Pyramid Scheme

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：金字塔骗局（Pyramid Scheme）是一种非法的多层次营销模式，其核心在于通过不断招募新成员来支付早期参与者的收益，而非通过实际销售产品或服务盈利。这种模式依赖于新成员的持续加入，一旦招募速度放缓或停止，整个体系就会崩溃。  
  **English Explanation**: A pyramid scheme is an illegal multi-level marketing model where the core mechanism relies on continuously recruiting new members to pay returns to earlier participants, rather than generating profits through the actual sale of products or services. This model depends on the constant influx of new members; once recruitment slows or stops, the entire system collapses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：金字塔骗局常伪装成合法的投资机会或直销项目，利用高回报承诺吸引参与者。常见场景包括虚假的投资平台、传销组织等。参与者往往被要求缴纳高额入门费或购买大量产品，最终导致经济损失。风险提示：此类骗局具有极强的隐蔽性和欺骗性，投资者需警惕“快速致富”的诱惑。  
  **English Explanation**: Pyramid schemes often masquerade as legitimate investment opportunities or direct sales programs, luring participants with promises of high returns. Common scenarios include fake investment platforms and multi-level marketing organizations. Participants are typically required to pay high entry fees or purchase large quantities of products, ultimately leading to financial losses. Risk Note: These schemes are highly deceptive and concealed; investors should be wary of "get-rich-quick" promises.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，金字塔骗局严重扰乱金融市场秩序，损害投资者利益；从投资角度看，它警示投资者需理性评估风险；从行业角度看，它揭示了非法营销模式的危害性。各国政府均将其列为重点打击对象。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, pyramid schemes severely disrupt financial market order and harm investor interests; from an investment perspective, they serve as a warning for investors to rationally assess risks; from an industry perspective, they highlight the dangers of illegal marketing models. Governments worldwide have classified them as key targets for crackdowns.
