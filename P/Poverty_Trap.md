# Poverty Trap

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **贫困陷阱** 是指个人或家庭因收入过低而无法积累足够的资源来改善生活条件，从而陷入长期贫困的恶性循环。这一概念最早由经济学家提出，核心在于低收入导致低储蓄和低投资，进而限制未来的收入增长。  
  **Poverty Trap** refers to a situation where individuals or families are unable to accumulate sufficient resources to improve their living conditions due to low income, thus falling into a vicious cycle of long-term poverty. This concept was first introduced by economists, with the core idea being that low income leads to low savings and low investment, thereby limiting future income growth.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，贫困陷阱常见于农村地区和欠发达城市，由于缺乏教育、医疗和基础设施，贫困人口难以摆脱困境。政府通过扶贫政策和资金支持来打破这一循环，但需注意政策执行的精准性和可持续性。  
  In China, poverty traps are commonly found in rural areas and underdeveloped cities, where the lack of education, healthcare, and infrastructure makes it difficult for the poor to escape their plight. The government uses poverty alleviation policies and financial support to break this cycle, but attention must be paid to the precision and sustainability of policy implementation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，识别和解决贫困陷阱是实现社会公平和经济可持续发展的重要任务。从投资角度看，打破贫困陷阱有助于释放潜在消费市场，促进经济增长。从行业角度看，扶贫项目为相关行业提供了发展机遇。  
  From a regulatory perspective, identifying and addressing poverty traps is crucial for achieving social equity and sustainable economic development. From an investment perspective, breaking the poverty trap helps unlock potential consumer markets and drive economic growth. From an industry perspective, poverty alleviation projects provide development opportunities for related sectors.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  贫困陷阱的概念最早可追溯到20世纪50年代的发展经济学研究，特别是阿瑟·刘易斯（Arthur Lewis）的二元经济理论。该理论认为发展中国家存在传统农业部门和现代工业部门的二元结构，导致劳动力无法有效转移和收入增长受限。  
  The concept of the poverty trap can be traced back to development economics research in the 1950s, particularly Arthur Lewis's dual-sector model. This theory posits that developing countries have a dual structure consisting of traditional agricultural sectors and modern industrial sectors, leading to ineffective labor transfer and limited income growth.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，贫困陷阱问题在改革开放初期尤为突出，随着扶贫政策的实施和经济的发展，情况有所改善。然而，地区发展不平衡和城乡差距仍然存在挑战。全球范围内，贫困陷阱是许多发展中国家面临的共同问题，国际组织如世界银行和联合国积极推动减贫项目。  
  In China, the issue of poverty traps was particularly prominent during the early stages of reform and opening up. With the implementation of poverty alleviation policies and economic development, conditions have improved. However, regional disparities and urban-rural gaps remain challenges. Globally, poverty traps are a common issue faced by many developing countries, with international organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations actively promoting poverty reduction projects.
