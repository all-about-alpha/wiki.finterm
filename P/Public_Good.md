# Public Good

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **公共物品** 是指那些具有非排他性和非竞争性的商品或服务，即一个人使用该物品不会减少其他人对其的使用，且无法排除他人使用。这一概念最早由经济学家保罗·萨缪尔森（Paul Samuelson）在1954年提出。  
  **Public Good** refers to goods or services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that one person's use does not reduce the availability for others, and it is impossible to exclude others from using them. This concept was first introduced by economist Paul Samuelson in 1954.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，公共物品的典型例子包括国防、公共公园和路灯等。这些物品由政府提供，以确保社会整体福利。需要注意的是，由于公共物品的非排他性，可能导致“搭便车”问题，即个人可能享受其好处而不承担成本。  
  In China, typical examples of public goods include national defense, public parks, and street lighting. These are provided by the government to ensure overall societal welfare. It is important to note that the non-excludability of public goods can lead to the "free rider" problem, where individuals may benefit without contributing to the cost.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，公共物品的提供是政府的重要职责之一，有助于维护社会公平与稳定。从投资和行业角度来看，公共物品的完善能够提升基础设施水平，促进经济发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, providing public goods is one of the government's key responsibilities, helping to maintain social equity and stability. From an investment and industry standpoint, well-developed public goods can enhance infrastructure levels and promote economic growth.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  公共物品的概念起源于20世纪中叶的经济学理论。保罗·萨缪尔森在其1954年的论文《公共支出的纯理论》中首次系统阐述了这一概念。此后，这一理论成为现代经济学中研究政府职能和市场失灵的重要工具。  
  The concept of public goods originated in mid-20th-century economic theory. Paul Samuelson first systematically articulated this concept in his 1954 paper "The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure." Since then, this theory has become an essential tool in modern economics for studying government functions and market failures.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，公共物品的理论为政府制定公共服务政策提供了重要依据。例如，“十三五”规划中明确提出要加强基础设施建设以提升公共服务水平。在全球范围内，公共物品的概念也被广泛应用于环境保护、全球卫生等领域的研究与实践。  
  In China, the theory of public goods has provided a crucial basis for government policies on public services. For example, the "13th Five-Year Plan" explicitly emphasized strengthening infrastructure construction to improve public service levels. Globally, the concept of public goods has been widely applied in research and practice in areas such as environmental protection and global health.
