# Preferred Dividend

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **优先股息** 是指公司向优先股股东支付的固定股息。优先股是一种介于普通股和债券之间的混合型证券，其股东在公司盈利时享有优先于普通股股东的股息分配权，但在公司破产清算时，其清偿顺序位于债权人之后。  
  **Preferred Dividend** refers to the fixed dividend paid by a company to its preferred shareholders. Preferred stock is a hybrid security that lies between common stock and bonds, granting its shareholders priority over common shareholders in dividend distribution when the company is profitable, but ranking behind creditors in the event of liquidation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，优先股息通常由大型国有企业或金融机构发行，以吸引稳健型投资者。投资者需注意，虽然优先股息相对稳定，但在公司经营不善时仍可能被暂停支付。此外，优先股通常不具有投票权，投资者在决策时应权衡收益与权利。  
  In China, preferred dividends are often issued by large state-owned enterprises or financial institutions to attract conservative investors. Investors should note that while preferred dividends are relatively stable, they may still be suspended if the company performs poorly. Additionally, preferred shares typically do not carry voting rights, so investors should weigh returns against rights when making decisions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，优先股息有助于优化公司资本结构；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了稳定的现金流；从行业角度看，优先股的发行有助于企业融资并降低财务风险。  
  From a regulatory perspective, preferred dividends help optimize a company's capital structure; from an investment perspective, they provide investors with stable cash flow; and from an industry perspective, issuing preferred shares helps companies raise funds and reduce financial risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  优先股的概念最早可追溯到19世纪的美国铁路公司。当时铁路建设需要大量资金，但普通股的波动性较大，难以吸引投资者。于是铁路公司发行了具有固定股息和优先权的股票，即优先股。这一创新为后来的资本市场发展奠定了基础。  
  The concept of preferred stock dates back to American railroad companies in the 19th century. At that time, railroad construction required significant funding, but the volatility of common stocks made it difficult to attract investors. Thus, railroad companies issued stocks with fixed dividends and priority rights—preferred stocks—laying the foundation for later developments in capital markets.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国资本市场中，优先股的引入丰富了投资者的选择范围，同时也为企业提供了多元化的融资工具。目前中国证监会已出台相关政策规范优先股的发行与交易。  
  In China's capital markets, the introduction of preferred stocks has expanded investor options while providing companies with diversified financing tools. Currently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has issued policies to regulate the issuance and trading of preferred stocks.
