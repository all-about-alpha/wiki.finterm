# Pump Priming

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “Pump Priming”直译为“泵启动”，在经济学中指的是政府通过增加公共支出或减税等手段，刺激经济增长，尤其是在经济衰退或低迷时期。这一概念最早由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯提出，核心思想是通过政府干预来激活市场需求，带动私人投资和消费。  
  **English Explanation**: "Pump Priming" literally translates to "pump starting," and in economics, it refers to the government stimulating economic growth by increasing public spending or reducing taxes, especially during periods of recession or economic downturn. This concept was first introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes, with the core idea being to activate market demand through government intervention, thereby driving private investment and consumption.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: Pump Priming通常应用于经济衰退或需求不足的时期。例如，政府可能通过基础设施建设、社会福利项目或直接向企业提供补贴来刺激经济活动。然而，这种政策可能导致财政赤字增加或通货膨胀风险，因此需要谨慎实施。  
  **English Explanation**: Pump Priming is typically applied during periods of economic recession or insufficient demand. For example, governments may stimulate economic activity through infrastructure construction, social welfare programs, or direct subsidies to businesses. However, such policies may lead to increased fiscal deficits or inflation risks, requiring careful implementation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管和投资角度来看，Pump Priming是应对经济危机的重要手段之一。它能够迅速提振市场信心，防止经济进一步下滑。从行业角度看，这种政策有助于推动特定领域（如基建、科技）的发展，创造就业机会。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory and investment perspective, Pump Priming is an important tool for addressing economic crises. It can quickly boost market confidence and prevent further economic decline. From an industry perspective, such policies help promote development in specific sectors (e.g., infrastructure, technology) and create job opportunities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: Pump Priming的概念起源于20世纪30年代的大萧条时期。凯恩斯在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出，政府应通过增加支出来弥补私人需求的不足，从而恢复经济增长。这一理论成为现代宏观经济政策的基石之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Pump Priming originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In his work "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," Keynes proposed that governments should increase spending to compensate for insufficient private demand, thereby restoring economic growth. This theory became one of the cornerstones of modern macroeconomic policy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: Pump Priming对全球经济政策产生了深远影响。许多国家在经济危机中采用类似措施（如2008年金融危机后的刺激计划），成功避免了更严重的经济衰退。如今，这一理念仍被广泛应用于各国政府的财政政策中。  
  **English Explanation**: Pump Priming has had a profound impact on global economic policies. Many countries have adopted similar measures during economic crises (e.g., stimulus packages after the 2008 financial crisis), successfully averting more severe recessions. Today, this concept remains widely applied in fiscal policies worldwide.
