# Prepayment Risk

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：提前还款风险是指借款人提前偿还贷款或债券本金，导致贷款人或债券持有人无法获得预期的利息收入的风险。这种风险常见于抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）和可赎回债券等金融产品中。  
  **English Explanation**: Prepayment risk refers to the risk that borrowers repay their loans or bond principal earlier than scheduled, resulting in lenders or bondholders not receiving the expected interest income. This risk is commonly associated with financial products such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and callable bonds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在房地产市场中，当利率下降时，借款人可能会选择提前偿还高利率的抵押贷款，以重新融资获得更低利率的贷款。这会导致抵押贷款支持证券的投资者面临利息收入减少的风险。此外，企业发行可赎回债券时，若市场利率下降，企业可能选择提前赎回债券并重新发行低利率债券，从而增加投资者的提前还款风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: In the real estate market, when interest rates fall, borrowers may choose to prepay high-interest mortgages to refinance at lower rates. This exposes investors in mortgage-backed securities to the risk of reduced interest income. Similarly, when companies issue callable bonds and market interest rates decline, they may opt to redeem the bonds early and reissue them at lower rates, increasing prepayment risk for investors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，提前还款风险影响金融机构的资产管理和流动性规划；从投资角度看，投资者需评估其投资组合中的提前还款风险以优化收益；从行业角度看，该风险推动了金融衍生品如利率互换和期权的发展，以对冲此类风险。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, prepayment risk affects financial institutions' asset management and liquidity planning. From an investment standpoint, investors need to assess prepayment risk in their portfolios to optimize returns. From an industry perspective, this risk has driven the development of financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps and options to hedge against it.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：提前还款风险的概念最早出现在20世纪70年代的美国房地产市场。随着抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）的兴起，投资者开始意识到借款人提前还款对其投资收益的影响。1980年代利率波动加剧后，这一风险变得更加显著。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of prepayment risk first emerged in the U.S. real estate market in the 1970s. With the rise of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), investors began to recognize the impact of borrower prepayments on their investment returns.
