## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：毒丸计划（Poison Pill）是一种反收购策略，由目标公司设计，旨在通过增加收购成本或稀释收购方股权来阻止恶意收购。该策略最早由美国律师马丁·利普顿（Martin Lipton）于1982年提出。核心概念包括发行新股、赋予现有股东特殊权利等，以降低公司对潜在收购者的吸引力。  
  **English Explanation**: A Poison Pill is a defensive strategy used by a target company to deter hostile takeovers by increasing the cost of acquisition or diluting the acquirer's equity. The strategy was first introduced by American lawyer Martin Lipton in 1982. Key concepts include issuing new shares or granting special rights to existing shareholders to make the company less attractive to potential acquirers.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：毒丸计划常用于上市公司面临恶意收购威胁时。例如，当某公司被大量买入股份时，毒丸计划会触发，允许其他股东以折扣价购买新股，从而稀释收购方的股权。需要注意的是，该策略可能引发法律纠纷或损害股东短期利益。  
  **English Explanation**: Poison Pills are often employed by publicly traded companies facing hostile takeover threats.
