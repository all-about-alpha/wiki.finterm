# Perpetual Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **永续债券**是一种没有固定到期日的债券，发行者只需定期支付利息，而无需偿还本金。这种债券的核心概念在于其“永久性”，即理论上可以无限期存在。  
  A **Perpetual Bond** is a type of bond with no fixed maturity date, where the issuer only needs to pay interest periodically without repaying the principal. The core concept lies in its "perpetuity," meaning it can theoretically exist indefinitely.

* **应用 / Application**  
  永续债券常用于企业或政府融资，特别是在需要长期资金支持但又不希望短期内偿还本金的场景中。投资者需注意其利率风险和流动性风险，因为永续债券的价格可能因市场利率波动而大幅波动。  
  Perpetual Bonds are often used by corporations or governments for financing, especially in scenarios requiring long-term capital support without the need for short-term principal repayment. Investors should be aware of interest rate risk and liquidity risk, as the price of perpetual bonds can fluctuate significantly due to market interest rate changes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，永续债券被视为一种混合资本工具，有助于提高企业的资本充足率。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了稳定的利息收入，但需承担更高的风险。在行业中，永续债券是重要的融资工具之一，尤其在金融和基础设施领域。  
  From a regulatory perspective, perpetual bonds are considered hybrid capital instruments that help improve a company's capital adequacy ratio. From an investment perspective, they provide investors with stable interest income but come with higher risks.
