# Predatory Pricing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 掠夺性定价是指企业以低于成本的价格销售产品或服务，旨在排挤竞争对手，待竞争对手退出市场后，再提高价格以获取垄断利润。这种行为通常被视为不正当竞争手段，受到反垄断法的严格监管。  
  **English Explanation**: Predatory pricing refers to the practice of selling products or services at a price below cost with the intent to drive competitors out of the market. Once competitors are eliminated, the firm raises prices to achieve monopoly profits. This practice is generally considered an anti-competitive strategy and is strictly regulated under antitrust laws.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 掠夺性定价常见于新兴市场或竞争激烈的行业，如零售、航空和电信等。企业通过短期亏损来换取长期的市场控制权。然而，这种行为可能导致市场垄断，损害消费者利益，因此受到监管机构的密切关注。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Predatory pricing is often observed in emerging markets or highly competitive industries such as retail, aviation, and telecommunications. Companies may incur short-term losses to gain long-term market control. However, this practice can lead to market monopolies and harm consumer interests, making it a focus of regulatory scrutiny.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，掠夺性定价破坏了市场竞争秩序，可能导致市场垄断；从投资角度看，这种行为可能影响企业的长期盈利能力；从行业角度看，它阻碍了创新和公平竞争。因此，反垄断法对掠夺性定价进行了严格限制。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, predatory pricing disrupts market competition and can lead to monopolies; from an investment standpoint, it may impact a company's long-term profitability; from an industry perspective, it stifles innovation and fair competition. As such, antitrust laws impose strict limitations on predatory pricing.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 掠夺性定价的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末的美国反垄断运动。当时，一些大企业通过低价策略排挤小企业，引发了公众和政府的关注。1890年通过的《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》首次将此类行为列为非法。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of predatory pricing dates back to the late 19th century during the American antitrust movement. Large corporations used low-price strategies to eliminate smaller competitors, drawing public and governmental attention. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was the first legislation to outlaw such practices.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: 掠夺性定价对行业的影响深远，尤其是在20世纪初的石油和钢铁行业。尽管现代反垄断法对此类行为进行了严格限制，但在全球范围内仍时有发生。当前，随着数字经济的兴起，掠夺性定价在科技行业中的表现尤为突出。  
  **English Impact**: Predatory pricing has had a profound impact on industries, particularly in oil and steel during the early 20th century. Although modern antitrust laws strictly regulate such practices, they still occur globally. Today, with the rise of the digital economy, predatory pricing is notably prevalent in the tech industry.
