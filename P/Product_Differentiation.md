  **中文解释**：产品差异化的概念起源于20世纪30年代的经济学理论。爱德华·张伯伦在其著作《垄断竞争理论》中首次系统阐述了这一概念，认为在不完全竞争市场中，企业通过差异化可以避免价格战并获得更高的利润。这一理论为现代市场营销和战略管理奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of product differentiation originated in the economic theories of the 1930s. Edward Chamberlin first systematically articulated this idea in his book *The Theory of Monopolistic Competition*, arguing that firms in imperfectly competitive markets could avoid price wars and achieve higher profits through differentiation. This theory laid the foundation for modern marketing and strategic management.
