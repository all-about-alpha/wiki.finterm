# Price to Tangible Book Value (PTBV)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：价格与有形账面价值比率（PTBV）是一种估值指标，用于衡量公司股票的市场价格与其有形资产净值之间的关系。有形账面价值是指公司总资产减去无形资产和负债后的净值。该比率由投资者和分析师广泛使用，以评估公司是否被市场高估或低估。  
  **English Explanation**: The Price to Tangible Book Value (PTBV) is a valuation metric that measures the relationship between a company's stock market price and its net tangible assets. Tangible book value is calculated as total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities. This ratio is widely used by investors and analysts to assess whether a company is overvalued or undervalued by the market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：PTBV常用于金融、房地产和制造业等重资产行业，帮助投资者判断公司的资产价值和投资潜力。低PTBV可能表明股票被低估，而高PTBV可能意味着股票被高估。然而，该指标不适用于无形资产占比较高的行业（如科技或服务业），且需结合其他财务指标综合分析。  
  **English Explanation**: PTBV is commonly applied in asset-heavy industries such as finance, real estate, and manufacturing to help investors evaluate a company's asset value and investment potential. A low PTBV may indicate an undervalued stock, while a high PTBV could suggest overvaluation. However, this metric is less suitable for industries with significant intangible assets (e.g., technology or services) and should be used alongside other financial indicators for comprehensive analysis.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，PTBV有助于识别潜在的风险公司；从投资角度看，它为价值投资者提供了重要的参考依据；从行业角度看，它反映了公司的资产质量和市场定位。在金融危机或经济下行期，该指标尤为重要。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, PTBV helps identify potentially risky companies; from an investment standpoint, it provides crucial insights for value investors; from an industry perspective, it reflects a company's asset quality and market positioning. This metric becomes particularly significant during financial crises or economic downturns.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：PTBV的概念起源于20世纪早期的价值投资理论，由本杰明·格雷厄姆和大卫·多德在其经典著作《证券分析》中首次提出。他们强调有形资产的重要性，认为其是评估公司价值的核心要素之一。随着金融市场的发展，这一指标逐渐成为全球投资者的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of PTBV originated in the early 20th century within the framework of value investing theory, first introduced by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in their seminal work *Security Analysis*. They emphasized the importance of tangible assets as a core element in evaluating company value. Over time, this metric has evolved into a vital tool for global investors.

* **影响 / Impact**
