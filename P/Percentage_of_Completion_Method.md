# Percentage of Completion Method

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：完工百分比法是一种会计方法，用于在长期工程项目或合同中确认收入和费用。该方法根据项目完成的进度比例，逐步确认收入和成本，而不是在项目全部完成时一次性确认。其核心概念是“按进度确认”，确保财务报表能够更准确地反映项目的实际进展和财务状况。  
  **English Explanation**: The Percentage of Completion Method is an accounting approach used to recognize revenue and expenses in long-term projects or contracts. This method gradually recognizes revenue and costs based on the proportion of the project completed, rather than recognizing them all at once upon project completion. Its core concept is "recognition by progress," ensuring that financial statements more accurately reflect the actual progress and financial status of the project.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：完工百分比法广泛应用于建筑、工程、软件开发等长期项目中。在这些场景中，项目周期较长，收入和成本的确认需要与项目进度相匹配。需要注意的是，该方法要求对项目进度进行可靠估计，若估计不准确可能导致财务报表失真。此外，该方法不适用于无法可靠估计进度的项目。  
  **English Explanation**: The Percentage of Completion Method is widely applied in long-term projects such as construction, engineering, and software development. In these scenarios, project cycles are lengthy, and the recognition of revenue and costs needs to align with project progress. It is important to note that this method requires reliable estimates of project progress; inaccurate estimates may lead to distorted financial statements. Additionally, this method is not suitable for projects where progress cannot be reliably estimated.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，完工百分比法有助于提高财务信息的透明度和可比性；从投资角度看，它使投资者能够更及时地了解项目的财务状况；从行业角度看，该方法为长期项目的财务管理提供了标准化工具，促进了行业的健康发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the Percentage of Completion Method enhances the transparency and comparability of financial information; from an investment perspective, it allows investors to understand a project's financial status more promptly; from an industry perspective, this method provides a standardized tool for financial management in long-term projects, promoting healthy industry development.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：完工百分比法的起源可以追溯到20世纪中期，随着大型工程项目的增多，传统的“合同完成法”无法满足财务报告的需求。美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）和国际会计准则理事会（IASB）逐步完善了相关准则，使其成为长期项目会计处理的主流方法之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of the Percentage of Completion Method dates back to the mid-20th century when traditional "completed contract methods" could not meet the needs of financial reporting due to the increase in large-scale projects. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) gradually refined related standards, making it one of the mainstream methods for accounting treatment in long-term projects.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：完工百分比法对建筑、工程等行业产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了财务报告的准确性，还促进了项目管理水平的提升。目前，该方法已成为全球范围内长期项目会计处理的重要工具之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The Percentage of Completion Method has had a profound impact on industries such as construction and engineering. It not only improves the accuracy of financial reporting but also enhances project management standards.
