# Price Discovery

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **价格发现** 是指通过市场交易活动，买卖双方在供需关系的作用下，确定某一资产或商品的市场价格的过程。这一过程通常发生在公开、透明的市场中，如股票交易所、期货市场等。价格发现的核心在于市场参与者通过交易行为反映其对资产价值的预期和判断。  
  **Price Discovery** refers to the process by which the market price of an asset or commodity is determined through trading activities, driven by supply and demand. This process typically occurs in open and transparent markets, such as stock exchanges or futures markets. The core of price discovery lies in market participants reflecting their expectations and judgments about the value of an asset through trading behavior.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在金融市场中，价格发现机制广泛应用于股票、债券、外汇和大宗商品等资产的定价。例如，股票交易所通过集中竞价的方式实现股票的价格发现。需要注意的是，价格发现的有效性依赖于市场的流动性和透明度，低流动性或信息不对称可能导致价格失真。  
  In financial markets, the price discovery mechanism is widely used for pricing assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and commodities. For example, stock exchanges achieve price discovery for stocks through centralized bidding. It is important to note that the effectiveness of price discovery depends on market liquidity and transparency; low liquidity or information asymmetry can lead to price distortions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，有效的价格发现机制有助于维护市场公平和稳定；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了决策依据；从行业角度看，它促进了资源的优化配置。因此，价格发现是金融市场健康运行的基础之一。  
  From a regulatory perspective, an effective price discovery mechanism helps maintain market fairness and stability; from an investment perspective, it provides a basis for decision-making; from an industry perspective, it promotes optimal resource allocation. Therefore, price discovery is one of the foundations of a healthy financial market.
