# Penny Stock

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Penny Stock（便士股票）是指那些交易价格极低（通常低于每股5美元）的小市值公司股票。这类股票通常在场外交易市场（OTC）或小型交易所进行交易，而非主要证券交易所。由于其低价格和高波动性，便士股票常被视为高风险投资。  
  **English Explanation**: Penny stocks are low-priced shares of small companies, typically trading for less than $5 per share. These stocks are often traded on over-the-counter (OTC) markets or small exchanges rather than major stock exchanges. Due to their low price and high volatility, penny stocks are considered high-risk investments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：便士股票通常吸引那些寻求高回报的投机者，但由于其流动性差、信息透明度低以及容易被操纵，投资者需谨慎对待。在中国，类似的概念包括“低价股”或“仙股”，但监管环境与国外有所不同。  
  **English Explanation**: Penny stocks often attract speculators looking for high returns, but due to their poor liquidity, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to manipulation, investors should approach them with caution. In China, similar concepts include "low-priced stocks" or "cent stocks," but the regulatory environment differs from that in other countries.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，便士股票因其高风险特性常受到严格监管；从投资角度看，它们为投资者提供了以小博大的机会，但也可能导致重大损失；从行业角度看，便士股票市场为小型企业提供了融资渠道。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, penny stocks are often subject to strict oversight due to their high-risk nature. From an investment standpoint, they offer the potential for significant gains but also pose substantial risks of loss. From an industry perspective, the penny stock market provides a funding avenue for small businesses.
