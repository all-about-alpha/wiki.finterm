# Price Leadership

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 价格领导（Price Leadership）是指在一个行业中，由一家或少数几家公司主导市场价格的行为。通常，这些公司因其市场份额、成本优势或品牌影响力而成为价格制定者，其他公司则跟随其定价策略。这一概念最早由经济学家在寡头垄断市场结构的研究中提出。  
  **English Explanation**: Price Leadership refers to a situation in an industry where one or a few companies dominate the market price. Typically, these companies, due to their market share, cost advantages, or brand influence, become price setters, while other firms follow their pricing strategies. This concept was first introduced by economists in the study of oligopolistic market structures.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 价格领导常见于寡头垄断市场，如石油、航空和电信行业。主导公司通过调整价格影响整个市场的供需关系，而跟随者则根据其定价调整自身策略。然而，这种行为可能引发反垄断调查，尤其是在主导公司滥用市场地位时。  
  **English Explanation**: Price Leadership is commonly observed in oligopolistic markets such as oil, aviation, and telecommunications. The leading company influences the supply and demand dynamics of the entire market by adjusting prices, while followers adjust their strategies accordingly. However, this behavior may trigger antitrust investigations, especially if the leading company abuses its market position.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，价格领导可能被视为市场操纵行为，需受到严格监控；从投资角度看，识别价格领导者有助于预测行业趋势；从行业角度看，它反映了市场竞争格局和企业的战略定位。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Price Leadership may be viewed as market manipulation and requires strict monitoring; from an investment perspective, identifying price leaders helps predict industry trends; from an industry perspective, it reflects the competitive landscape and strategic positioning of firms.

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 价格领导的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的经济学研究，特别是在爱德华·张伯伦（Edward Chamberlin）和琼·罗宾逊（Joan Robinson）对不完全竞争市场的分析中。随着寡头垄断市场的兴起，这一理论逐渐被广泛应用于实际经济分析中。

* **影响 / Impact**
