## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  价格上限的概念可追溯至古代中国，如汉朝时期的“平准法”，旨在通过政府干预平抑物价。现代意义上的价格上限则源于20世纪初的经济危机时期，各国政府为应对通货膨胀和物资短缺而广泛采用。  
  The concept of price ceilings dates back to ancient China, such as the "Pingzhun Law" during the Han Dynasty, which aimed to stabilize prices through government intervention. In the modern sense, price ceilings originated during the economic crises of the early 20th century when governments widely adopted them to combat inflation and material shortages.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，价格上限政策在计划经济时期发挥了重要作用，确保了基本物资的公平分配。如今，其在特定领域（如房地产租金管制）仍被使用，但需平衡市场效率与公平性。在全球范围内，价格上限常用于应对突发事件（如自然灾害或疫情）导致的物价波动。  
  In China, price ceiling policies played a significant role during the planned economy era by ensuring fair distribution of essential goods. Today, they are still used in specific areas (e.g., rent control in real estate) but require balancing market efficiency and fairness. Globally, price ceilings are often employed to address price fluctuations caused by emergencies (e.g., natural disasters or pandemics).
