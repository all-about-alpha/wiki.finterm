  **English Explanation**: Pink Sheets refer to a segment of the over-the-counter (OTC) market in the United States, providing a platform for trading stocks of companies not listed on major stock exchanges. These companies are typically smaller, disclose less information, and are not subject to stringent regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The name "Pink Sheets" originates from the pink paper on which these listings were historically printed.

  **English Application Scenarios**: Pink Sheets primarily cater to small or startup companies that cannot meet the listing requirements of major exchanges. Investors can engage in high-risk, high-reward investments through this market but should be cautious about its low liquidity, limited disclosure, and potential fraud risks.
