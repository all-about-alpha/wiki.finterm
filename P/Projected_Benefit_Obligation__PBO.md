# Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：预计福利义务（Projected Benefit Obligation, PBO）是指企业根据员工未来退休时的预计工资水平，计算出的养老金支付义务的现值。它反映了企业在未来需要支付的养老金总额，考虑了员工的工龄、工资增长率和折现率等因素。  
  **English Explanation**: The Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) is the present value of the pension benefits that a company expects to pay to its employees upon their retirement, based on projected future salary levels. It reflects the total pension obligations a company will need to fulfill, taking into account factors such as employee tenure, salary growth rates, and discount rates.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：PBO主要用于企业养老金计划的财务报告和风险管理。企业通过计算PBO来评估其养老金负债的规模，并据此制定资金筹措和投资策略。需要注意的是，PBO的计算依赖于对未来工资增长率和折现率的假设，这些假设的不确定性可能带来财务风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: PBO is primarily used in financial reporting and risk management for corporate pension plans. Companies calculate PBO to assess the size of their pension liabilities and develop funding and investment strategies accordingly. It is important to note that PBO calculations rely on assumptions about future salary growth rates and discount rates, which can introduce financial risks due to their inherent uncertainty.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，PBO是企业财务报表中必须披露的重要指标，有助于监管机构评估企业的财务健康状况。从投资角度看，PBO为投资者提供了企业长期负债的清晰视图，影响其投资决策。从行业角度看，PBO的计算和管理是养老金计划运营的核心环节，直接影响企业的财务稳定性和员工福利保障。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, PBO is a critical metric that must be disclosed in corporate financial statements, helping regulators assess a company's financial health. From an investment standpoint, PBO provides investors with a clear view of a company's long-term liabilities, influencing their investment decisions. From an industry perspective, the calculation and management of PBO are central to pension plan operations, directly impacting a company's financial stability and employee benefit security.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：预计福利义务的概念起源于20世纪70年代美国养老金制度改革时期。随着《雇员退休收入保障法》（ERISA）的颁布，企业被要求更透明地披露其养老金负债情况。这一背景下，PBO作为一种衡量养老金负债的方法逐渐被广泛采用。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of Projected Benefit Obligation emerged during the U.S. pension reform in the 1970s. With the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), companies were required to disclose their pension liabilities more transparently. In this context, PBO became widely adopted as a method for measuring pension obligations.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：PBO的引入显著提高了企业养老金负债的透明度，促进了更稳健的财务管理实践。如今，PPO已成为全球范围内企业养老金计划管理的重要工具，特别是在美国和欧洲等发达市场。然而，随着人口老龄化和经济环境的变化，PPO的计算和管理也面临新的挑战。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of PPO significantly enhanced transparency in corporate pension liabilities, promoting more robust financial management practices. Today, PPO is an essential tool for managing corporate pension plans globally, particularly in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe. However, with aging populations and changing economic conditions, calculating and managing PPO presents new challenges.
