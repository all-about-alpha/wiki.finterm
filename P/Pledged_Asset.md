# Pledged Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 质押资产是指借款人为了获得贷款或信用额度，将其拥有的资产（如房产、股票、债券等）作为担保物抵押给贷款方的资产。如果借款人未能按时还款，贷款方有权依法处置该资产以弥补损失。  
  **English Explanation**: A pledged asset refers to an asset (such as real estate, stocks, bonds, etc.) that a borrower offers as collateral to a lender in exchange for a loan or credit line. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender has the legal right to seize and sell the asset to recover the outstanding amount.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 质押资产广泛应用于个人贷款、企业融资和证券交易等领域。例如，企业可能将厂房或设备作为质押物以获得流动资金，个人可能将房产或股票质押以获取消费贷款。需要注意的是，质押资产的价值波动可能影响借款人的还款能力，且违约可能导致资产被强制处置。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Pledged assets are widely used in personal loans, corporate financing, and securities trading. For instance, a company might pledge its factory or equipment to secure working capital, while an individual might pledge their home or stocks for a consumer loan. It’s important to note that fluctuations in the value of pledged assets can impact the borrower’s repayment ability, and default may lead to forced liquidation of the asset.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，质押资产是金融机构风险管理的重要工具；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了额外的安全保障；从行业角度看，它促进了资金流动性和经济活动的开展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, pledged assets are crucial for financial institutions’ risk management. From an investment standpoint, they provide additional security for investors. From an industry perspective, they enhance liquidity and facilitate economic activities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**
