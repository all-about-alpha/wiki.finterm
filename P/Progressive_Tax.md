# Progressive Tax

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：累进税（Progressive Tax）是一种税收制度，其税率随着纳税人收入的增加而逐步提高。这意味着高收入者需要支付更高比例的税款，而低收入者则支付较低比例的税款。累进税的核心概念是通过税收调节收入分配，减少贫富差距，促进社会公平。  
  **English Explanation**: A progressive tax is a tax system where the tax rate increases as the taxable income of the taxpayer rises. This means that higher-income individuals pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes, while lower-income individuals pay a smaller percentage. The core concept of a progressive tax is to adjust income distribution through taxation, reduce wealth inequality, and promote social equity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：累进税广泛应用于个人所得税、企业所得税等领域。例如，中国的个人所得税采用累进税率，收入越高，适用的税率越高。在实际应用中，累进税有助于缩小收入差距，但也可能面临高收入者避税或逃税的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Progressive taxes are widely applied in areas such as personal income tax and corporate income tax. For example, China's personal income tax adopts a progressive tax rate, where higher incomes are subject to higher tax rates. In practice, progressive taxes help reduce income inequality but may also face risks of tax avoidance or evasion by high-income earners.
