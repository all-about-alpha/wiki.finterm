## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：代理投票（Proxy Vote）是指股东无法亲自出席公司股东大会时，委托他人（通常是代理人或受托人）代为行使投票权的行为。这一机制允许股东通过书面授权或电子方式，将自己的投票权转移给第三方，以确保其意见在公司决策中得到体现。核心概念包括“委托授权”和“投票权转移”。  
  **English Explanation**: A proxy vote refers to the act of a shareholder delegating their voting rights to another person (typically a proxy or trustee) when they are unable to attend a company's shareholder meeting in person. This mechanism allows shareholders to transfer their voting rights to a third party through written authorization or electronic means, ensuring their opinions are represented in corporate decision-making. Key concepts include "delegation of authority" and "transfer of voting rights."

* **应用 / Application**

  **English Explanation**: Proxy voting is widely used in scenarios such as shareholder meetings of publicly traded companies, board elections, and major decision-making processes. Shareholders can authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf by completing a proxy voting form or using an electronic voting system.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：代理投票的起源可以追溯到19世纪末的美国。随着公司规模的扩大和股东数量的增加，股东亲自出席股东大会变得困难。1900年代初，美国证券法逐步引入代理投票制度，以解决这一问题。1929年股市崩盘后，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）进一步规范了代理投票的流程，确保股东权益得到保护。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of proxy voting dates back to the late 19th century in the United States. As companies grew larger and the number of shareholders increased, it became difficult for shareholders to attend meetings in person. In the early 1900s, U.S. securities laws gradually introduced proxy voting to address this issue. After the stock market crash of 1929, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further standardized the proxy voting process to ensure shareholder rights were protected.
