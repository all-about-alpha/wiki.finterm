# Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：市净率（Price-to-Book Ratio，简称P/B Ratio）是衡量公司股票市场价格与其账面价值之间关系的财务指标。它通过将公司的市值除以其股东权益的账面价值来计算，反映了投资者愿意为公司每单位净资产支付的价格。该指标由本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）和大卫·多德（David Dodd）在20世纪30年代提出，是价值投资的核心工具之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) is a financial metric that measures the relationship between a company's market price and its book value. It is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by its shareholders' equity, reflecting the price investors are willing to pay for each unit of net assets. This metric was introduced by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in the 1930s and is a cornerstone of value investing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：市净率常用于评估银行、保险等金融类公司的估值，因为这些行业的资产和负债结构相对清晰。此外，它也适用于重资产行业如制造业和房地产。然而，市净率不适用于轻资产或高增长行业（如科技公司），因为这些公司的账面价值可能无法反映其真实价值。投资者需注意，过高的市净率可能意味着股票被高估，而过低的市净率可能暗示潜在的投资机会或公司存在财务问题。  
  **English Explanation**: The P/B Ratio is commonly used to evaluate the valuation of financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies, as their asset and liability structures are relatively clear. It is also applicable to asset-heavy industries like manufacturing and real estate. However, it is less suitable for asset-light or high-growth industries (e.g., technology companies), as their book value may not reflect their true worth. Investors should note that a high P/B Ratio may indicate overvaluation, while a low P/B Ratio could signal potential investment opportunities or underlying financial issues.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，市净率是评估金融机构稳健性的重要指标；从投资角度看，它是价值投资者筛选低估股票的关键工具；从行业角度看，它帮助分析师比较同行业内公司的估值水平。在中国市场，市净率也被广泛用于评估国有企业和上市银行的财务健康状况。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the P/B Ratio is crucial for assessing the stability of financial institutions; from an investment standpoint, it is a key tool for value investors to identify undervalued stocks; from an industry perspective, it helps analysts compare valuation levels within sectors. In China, the P/B Ratio is widely used to evaluate the financial health of state-owned enterprises and listed banks.
