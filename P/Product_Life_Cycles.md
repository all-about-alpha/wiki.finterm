## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **产品生命周期**是指一个产品从进入市场到退出市场的整个过程，通常包括引入期、成长期、成熟期和衰退期四个阶段。这一概念由美国经济学家雷蒙德·弗农（Raymond Vernon）于1966年提出，用于描述产品在市场中的动态变化。  
  **Product Life Cycle** refers to the entire process of a product from its introduction to the market until its withdrawal, typically including four stages: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. This concept was introduced by American economist Raymond Vernon in 1966 to describe the dynamic changes of products in the market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在产品管理中，企业通过分析产品生命周期来制定营销策略、优化资源配置和预测市场趋势。例如，在引入期，企业可能采取高投入的广告策略；在成熟期，则可能通过降价或改进产品来维持市场份额。需要注意的是，不同产品的生命周期长度和特征可能差异较大。  
  In product management, companies analyze the product life cycle to formulate marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and predict market trends. For example, during the introduction stage, companies may adopt high-investment advertising strategies; during the maturity stage, they may maintain market share through price reductions or product improvements. It is important to note that the length and characteristics of life cycles can vary significantly across different products.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  1966年，美国经济学家雷蒙德·弗农在国际贸易理论中首次提出了“产品生命周期”概念。他通过观察美国制造业的出口模式发现，产品的生产和销售会随着时间推移在不同国家之间转移。这一理论后来被广泛应用于市场营销和战略管理领域。  
  In 1966, American economist Raymond Vernon first introduced the concept of "product life cycle" in international trade theory. By observing the export patterns of U.S. manufacturing industries, he discovered that production and sales of products would shift between countries over time. This theory was later widely applied in marketing and strategic management.
