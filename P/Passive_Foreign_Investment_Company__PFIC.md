# Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **被动外国投资公司（PFIC）** 是美国税法中的一个术语，指那些主要收入来自被动投资（如股息、利息、资本利得等）而非主动经营业务的外国公司。根据美国《国内税收法典》（Internal Revenue Code）第1297条，如果一家外国公司满足以下两个条件之一，即被视为PFIC：1) 其75%以上的收入来自被动来源；2) 其50%以上的资产用于产生被动收入。  
  **A Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)** is a term in U.S. tax law referring to a foreign corporation whose income primarily comes from passive investments (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains) rather than active business operations. Under Section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code, a foreign company is classified as a PFIC if it meets either of the following criteria: 1) more than 75% of its income is passive; or 2) more than 50% of its assets are held for producing passive income.

* **应用 / Application**  
  对于美国纳税人而言，投资于PFIC可能会带来复杂的税务问题。例如，PFIC的收益可能被征收高额税款，且纳税人需提交额外的税务表格（如Form 8621）。此外，PFIC的税务处理方式包括“合格选举基金”（QEF）或“超额分配法”（Excess Distribution Method），投资者需谨慎选择以优化税务负担。  
  风险提示：未正确申报PFIC投资可能导致罚款或审计。  
  For U.S. taxpayers, investing in a PFIC can lead to complex tax issues. For instance, PFIC earnings may be subject to high taxes, and taxpayers are required to file additional forms (e.g., Form 8621). Additionally, PFICs are taxed under methods such as the Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) or Excess Distribution Method, and investors must carefully choose the optimal approach to minimize tax liabilities.  
  Risk Note: Failure to properly report PFIC investments may result in penalties or audits.

  1986年，美国国会通过了《税收改革法案》（Tax Reform Act），其中引入了PFIC的概念。这一规则的制定是为了应对当时日益增长的跨国避税行为，特别是通过投资低税率国家的外国公司来规避美国税收的现象。

* **影响 / Impact**
