# Bull Put Spread

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    牛市看跌期权价差（Bull Put Spread）是一种期权交易策略，由同时买入和卖出两个具有相同到期日但不同行权价的看跌期权组成。投资者通过卖出较高行权价的看跌期权（收取权利金）并买入较低行权价的看跌期权（支付权利金）来构建该策略。其核心目标是利用市场上涨或持平的预期，通过权利金差额获利。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Bull Put Spread is an options trading strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling two put options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. The strategy is constructed by selling a higher strike price put option (collecting a premium) and buying a lower strike price put option (paying a premium). The primary goal is to profit from the premium difference when the market is expected to rise or remain stable.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    牛市看跌期权价差适用于投资者对市场持温和看涨或中性预期时。例如，当投资者认为某只股票不会跌破某一支撑位时，可以使用该策略。风险在于，如果市场价格大幅下跌，投资者可能面临最大损失，即两个行权价之差减去净权利金收入。  
  - **English Application**  
    The Bull Put Spread is suitable for investors with a moderately bullish or neutral market outlook. For instance, it can be used when an investor believes a stock will not fall below a certain support level. The risk lies in the potential for maximum loss, which is the difference between the two strike prices minus the net premium received, if the market price drops significantly.
