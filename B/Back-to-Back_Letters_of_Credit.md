# Back-to-Back Letters of Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：背对背信用证（Back-to-Back Letters of Credit）是指在国际贸易中，中间商以买方开立的原始信用证（主信用证）作为担保，向银行申请开立另一份信用证（子信用证）给实际供货商的一种融资方式。核心概念包括主信用证、子信用证、中间商和实际供货商。  
  **English Explanation**: Back-to-Back Letters of Credit refer to a financing method in international trade where an intermediary uses the original letter of credit (master L/C) issued by the buyer as collateral to apply for another letter of credit (secondary L/C) from a bank to pay the actual supplier. Key concepts include the master L/C, secondary L/C, intermediary, and actual supplier.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：背对背信用证常用于中间商贸易场景，例如当中间商无法直接向买方披露供货商信息时。应用时需注意主信用证与子信用证的条款一致性，以及银行对中间商信用风险的评估。风险包括主信用证未能履约导致子信用证无法兑付。  
  **English Explanation**: Back-to-Back Letters of Credit are commonly used in intermediary trade scenarios, such as when the intermediary cannot disclose supplier information directly to the buyer. Key considerations include ensuring consistency between the terms of the master L/C and the secondary L/C, as well as the bank's assessment of the intermediary's credit risk. Risks include the master L/C failing to perform, leading to the secondary L/C being unpaid.
