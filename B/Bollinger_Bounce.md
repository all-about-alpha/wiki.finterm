# Bollinger Bounce

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：布林带反弹（Bollinger Bounce）是一种基于布林带（Bollinger Bands）技术分析工具的交易策略。布林带由约翰·布林格（John Bollinger）在1980年代发明，由三条线组成：中轨（移动平均线）、上轨（中轨加上两倍标准差）和下轨（中轨减去两倍标准差）。布林带反弹策略认为，当价格触及布林带的下轨时，市场可能超卖，价格倾向于反弹回中轨；反之，当价格触及上轨时，市场可能超买，价格倾向于回落至中轨。  
  **English Explanation**: The Bollinger Bounce is a trading strategy based on the Bollinger Bands technical analysis tool. Bollinger Bands were developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s and consist of three lines: the middle band (a moving average), the upper band (middle band plus two standard deviations), and the lower band (middle band minus two standard deviations). The Bollinger Bounce strategy suggests that when the price touches the lower band, the market may be oversold, and the price is likely to bounce back toward the middle band. Conversely, when the price touches the upper band, the market may be overbought, and the price is likely to pull back toward the middle band.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：布林带反弹策略常用于股票、外汇和期货市场的短期交易中。交易者通常在价格触及布林带下轨时买入，预期价格反弹至中轨时卖出；或在价格触及上轨时卖出，预期价格回落至中轨时买入。需要注意的是，该策略在震荡市场中表现较好，但在趋势市场中可能失效，因此需结合其他指标（如相对强弱指数RSI）进行确认。  
  **English Application**: The Bollinger Bounce strategy is commonly used in short-term trading in stock, forex, and futures markets. Traders typically buy when the price touches the lower band, expecting a bounce back to the middle band, or sell when the price touches the upper band, expecting a pullback to the middle band. It is important to note that this strategy performs well in range-bound markets but may fail in trending markets. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other indicators (such as the Relative Strength Index, RSI) for confirmation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：布林带反弹策略为投资者提供了一种简单有效的市场超买超卖判断工具，尤其在震荡市场中具有较高的实用性。它帮助交易者识别潜在的反转点，优化入场和出场时机，从而提高交易胜率。从行业角度看，布林带及其衍生策略已成为技术分析领域的重要组成部分。  
  **English Significance**: The Bollinger Bounce strategy provides investors with a simple yet effective tool for identifying overbought and oversold market conditions, particularly in range-bound markets. It helps traders identify potential reversal points and optimize entry and exit timing, thereby improving trading success rates. From an industry perspective, Bollinger Bands and their derivative strategies have become an integral part of technical analysis.
