# Balanced Budget

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：平衡预算是指政府在一定财政年度内，财政收入与财政支出相等，既无赤字也无盈余的财政状态。这一概念最早由古典经济学家提出，强调财政纪律和可持续性。核心在于通过合理的税收和支出安排，确保财政健康运行。  
  **English Explanation**: A balanced budget refers to a fiscal condition where a government's revenues equal its expenditures within a specific fiscal year, resulting in neither a deficit nor a surplus. This concept, originating from classical economists, emphasizes fiscal discipline and sustainability. The core idea is to ensure healthy fiscal operations through reasonable taxation and expenditure arrangements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：平衡预算常用于政府财政管理中，特别是在经济稳定时期，以避免过度借贷和财政风险。然而，在经济衰退或危机时期，严格的平衡预算可能限制政府通过财政刺激政策应对经济下滑的能力。因此，灵活运用平衡预算原则是关键。  
  **English Explanation**: Balanced budgets are commonly applied in government fiscal management, especially during periods of economic stability, to avoid excessive borrowing and fiscal risks. However, during economic recessions or crises, strict adherence to a balanced budget may limit the government's ability to implement fiscal stimulus policies to counteract economic downturns. Therefore, flexible application of the balanced budget principle is crucial.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：平衡预算的概念可追溯至18世纪的古典经济学派，代表人物如亚当·斯密和大卫·李嘉图。他们主张政府应像家庭一样量入为出，避免赤字。19世纪末至20世纪初，平衡预算成为许多国家财政政策的核心原则。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of a balanced budget dates back to the classical economic school of the 18th century, with figures like Adam Smith and David Ricardo advocating that governments should live within their means, similar to households, to avoid deficits. By the late 19th to early 20th century, the balanced budget became a core principle of fiscal policy in many countries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：平衡预算原则对全球财政政策产生了深远影响。在20世纪大萧条后，凯恩斯主义兴起，主张在经济衰退时允许赤字以刺激经济，平衡预算的地位有所下降。然而，20世纪80年代后，随着新古典经济学的复兴，平衡预算再次受到重视，成为许多国家财政改革的目标。  
  **English Explanation**: The principle of a balanced budget has had a profound impact on global fiscal policy. After the Great Depression of the 20th century, Keynesian economics emerged, advocating for deficits during economic downturns to stimulate growth, which diminished the prominence of balanced budgets. However, with the revival of neoclassical economics in the 1980s, balanced budgets regained importance and became a goal of fiscal reform in many countries.
