# Budget Deficit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    预算赤字（Budget Deficit）是指政府在一定时期内（通常为一个财政年度）的支出超过其收入的情况。这一概念源于财政学，核心在于政府通过借贷或其他方式弥补收支缺口，以维持经济运行或实现特定政策目标。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A budget deficit occurs when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues over a specific period, typically a fiscal year. This concept originates from public finance and focuses on how governments address the shortfall through borrowing or other means to sustain economic operations or achieve specific policy goals.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    预算赤字常见于经济刺激计划、基础设施建设或社会福利支出增加时。例如，在经济衰退期间，政府可能通过扩大赤字来增加公共支出，以刺激经济增长。然而，长期高赤字可能导致债务累积、通货膨胀或信用评级下降等风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    Budget deficits are often seen in scenarios such as economic stimulus programs, infrastructure development, or increased social welfare spending. For instance, during a recession, governments may increase public spending by running a deficit to stimulate economic growth. However, prolonged high deficits can lead to risks such as debt accumulation, inflation, or credit rating downgrades.

  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, budget deficits are a key indicator of fiscal health. From an investment standpoint, the scale of deficits affects bond interest rates and market confidence. From an industry perspective, deficit policies can drive growth in specific sectors, such as infrastructure or healthcare.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    预算赤字的概念可追溯至17世纪的欧洲，当时各国为应对战争和经济危机开始大规模借贷。现代赤字理论则主要由约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在20世纪30年代提出，他主张在经济衰退时通过增加政府支出来刺激需求。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of budget deficits dates back to 17th-century Europe, when nations began borrowing heavily to finance wars and economic crises. Modern deficit theory was primarily developed by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who advocated for increased government spending during economic downturns to stimulate demand.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**  
    预算赤字政策在二战后被广泛采用，推动了全球经济复苏和福利国家建设。然而，20世纪70年代的滞胀危机暴露了赤字政策的局限性。如今，各国在赤字管理上更加注重平衡短期刺激与长期财政可持续性。  
  - **English Impact**  
    Budget deficit policies were widely adopted after World War II, driving global economic recovery and the development of welfare states. However, the stagflation crisis of the 1970s revealed the limitations of deficit policies. Today, countries focus more on balancing short-term stimulus with long-term fiscal sustainability.
