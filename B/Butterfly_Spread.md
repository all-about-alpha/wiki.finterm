# Butterfly Spread

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    蝶式价差（Butterfly Spread）是一种期权交易策略，通常用于在预期标的资产价格波动较小的情况下获利。它涉及同时买入和卖出多个不同行权价的期权合约，通常包括两个买入期权和两个卖出期权，形成一个对称的收益结构。蝶式价差的核心概念是通过组合不同行权价的期权，限制潜在亏损的同时，最大化在特定价格范围内的收益。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Butterfly Spread is an options trading strategy typically used to profit when the underlying asset's price is expected to experience low volatility. It involves simultaneously buying and selling multiple options contracts with different strike prices, usually consisting of two long options and two short options, forming a symmetrical payoff structure. The core concept of the Butterfly Spread is to limit potential losses while maximizing gains within a specific price range by combining options with different strike prices.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    蝶式价差常用于投资者预期标的资产价格将在某一区间内波动时。例如，在财报发布前或重大事件后，市场波动性较低时，投资者可以通过构建蝶式价差来捕捉价格稳定带来的收益。需要注意的是，蝶式价差的盈利空间有限，且需要精确预测价格波动范围，否则可能导致亏损。  
  - **English Application**  
    The Butterfly Spread is commonly used when investors expect the underlying asset's price to fluctuate within a specific range. For example, before earnings announcements or after significant events when market volatility is low, investors can construct a Butterfly Spread to capture gains from price stability. It is important to note that the profit potential of a Butterfly Spread is limited, and precise prediction of the price range is required; otherwise, losses may occur.
