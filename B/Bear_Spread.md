# Bear Spread

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：熊市价差（Bear Spread）是一种期权交易策略，通常用于投资者预期标的资产价格将下跌时。该策略通过同时买入和卖出相同类型的期权（如看涨期权或看跌期权），但具有不同的行权价格或到期日，以限制潜在损失并锁定利润。常见的熊市价差包括熊市看涨价差（Bear Call Spread）和熊市看跌价差（Bear Put Spread）。  
  **English Explanation**: A Bear Spread is an options trading strategy typically used when investors anticipate a decline in the price of the underlying asset. This strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling the same type of options (such as call or put options) but with different strike prices or expiration dates, aiming to limit potential losses and lock in profits. Common types include Bear Call Spread and Bear Put Spread.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：熊市价差常用于股票、指数或商品市场，适用于投资者对市场持谨慎态度但又不希望承担过高风险的场景。例如，当投资者认为某只股票价格将小幅下跌时，可以通过构建熊市看涨价差来获利。需要注意的是，该策略的收益有限，且需支付期权交易的手续费。
