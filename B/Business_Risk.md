## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

  商业风险（Business Risk）是指企业在经营过程中，由于外部环境变化或内部管理不善，导致企业无法实现预期目标或遭受损失的可能性。这一概念最早由经济学家弗兰克·奈特（Frank Knight）在其1921年的著作《风险、不确定性与利润》中提出，核心在于区分可量化的风险与不可量化的不确定性。商业风险通常包括市场风险、运营风险、财务风险和法律风险等。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Business Risk refers to the possibility that a company may fail to achieve its expected goals or suffer losses due to changes in the external environment or poor internal management. This concept was first introduced by economist Frank Knight in his 1921 book *Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit*, which distinguishes between quantifiable risks and unquantifiable uncertainties. Business risks typically include market risk, operational risk, financial risk, and legal risk.

For instance, when entering a new market, companies must evaluate external factors such as market demand and competitive environment.

Companies often mitigate risks through identification, assessment, and response measures such as insurance or hedging tools.
