## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Bespoke CDO（定制型债务抵押债券）是一种非标准化的结构性金融产品，通常由投资银行根据特定客户的需求量身定制。其核心概念是将一组债务资产（如贷款、债券等）打包，并通过分层（tranches）的方式发行不同风险等级的证券。与传统的CDO不同，Bespoke CDO的资产池和结构设计更加灵活，以满足特定投资者的风险偏好和收益目标。  
  **English Explanation**: A Bespoke CDO (Customized Collateralized Debt Obligation) is a non-standardized structured financial product typically tailored by investment banks to meet the specific needs of individual clients. Its core concept involves bundling a pool of debt assets (such as loans, bonds, etc.) and issuing securities with varying risk levels through tranches. Unlike traditional CDOs, Bespoke CDOs offer greater flexibility in asset pools and structural design to align with specific investors' risk appetites and return objectives.
