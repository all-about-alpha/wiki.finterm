# Book-to-Bill

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Book-to-Bill（订单出货比）是一个衡量企业订单量与出货量之间关系的财务指标。它通过将某一时期内收到的订单总额（Book）与同期出货总额（Bill）进行比较，反映企业的业务增长趋势。通常，Book-to-Bill比率大于1表示订单量超过出货量，预示未来业务增长；比率小于1则可能表明市场需求疲软。  
  **English Explanation**: Book-to-Bill is a financial metric that measures the relationship between a company's order intake (Book) and its shipment volume (Bill) over a specific period. It compares the total value of orders received during the period to the total value of shipments made. A Book-to-Bill ratio greater than 1 indicates that orders exceed shipments, suggesting future business growth, while a ratio less than 1 may signal weak market demand.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：Book-to-Bill广泛应用于半导体、电子制造、航空航天等资本密集型行业，用于评估企业的市场表现和未来收入潜力。投资者和分析师通过该指标判断行业景气度，企业则用它来调整生产计划和库存管理。需要注意的是，该指标可能受季节性因素或一次性大订单影响，需结合其他财务数据综合分析。  
  **English Application**: Book-to-Bill is widely used in capital-intensive industries such as semiconductors, electronics manufacturing, and aerospace to assess market performance and future revenue potential. Investors and analysts use this metric to gauge industry trends, while companies rely on it to adjust production plans and inventory management. It is important to note that the ratio may be influenced by seasonal factors or one-time large orders, so it should be analyzed alongside other financial data.
