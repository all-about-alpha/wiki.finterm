Risk Note: Bad debt directly impacts a company's cash flow and financial statements, necessitating risk management measures such as setting aside bad debt provisions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：坏账的概念最早可追溯至中世纪欧洲的银行业。当时，商人借贷活动频繁，但由于缺乏完善的信用体系，债务违约现象普遍。19世纪工业革命后，随着商业规模的扩大，坏账问题逐渐成为企业财务管理的重要课题。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of bad debt dates back to medieval European banking. At that time, merchant lending was frequent, but due to the lack of a robust credit system, debt defaults were common. After the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, as business scales expanded, bad debt became a critical issue in corporate financial management.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：坏账对金融行业的影响深远。例如，2008年全球金融危机中，大量次级贷款违约导致银行坏账激增，进而引发系统性风险。目前，各国通过加强信用评级和风险管理来降低坏账率。  
  **English Impact**: Bad debt has had a profound impact on the financial industry. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, a surge in subprime loan defaults led to a sharp increase in bad debt for banks, triggering systemic risks.
