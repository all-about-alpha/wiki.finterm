# Bridge Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  过桥贷款（Bridge Loan）是一种短期融资工具，通常用于在长期融资安排完成之前提供临时资金支持。这种贷款通常由企业或个人在资金周转困难时使用，以“过渡”到更稳定的融资来源。其特点是期限短、利率较高，且通常需要抵押物。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A bridge loan is a short-term financing tool designed to provide temporary funding until a more permanent financial arrangement is secured. It is commonly used by businesses or individuals facing liquidity challenges to "bridge" the gap until stable financing is obtained. Key features include short maturity, higher interest rates, and often collateral requirements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  过桥贷款常用于房地产交易、企业并购或项目融资中。例如，在房地产交易中，买方可能在出售现有房产前需要资金购买新房产，此时过桥贷款可提供临时资金支持。风险在于，如果长期融资未能及时到位，借款人可能面临较高的还款压力。  
  **English Application**：  
  Bridge loans are frequently used in real estate transactions, corporate mergers, or project financing. For instance, in real estate, a buyer may need funds to purchase a new property before selling their current one, and a bridge loan can provide interim financing. The risk lies in the potential for high repayment pressure if long-term financing is not secured in time.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  过桥贷款在金融市场中扮演着重要角色，尤其是在资金流动性紧张的情况下。它为企业和个人提供了灵活的资金解决方案，有助于推动交易和项目的顺利进行。然而，由于其高利率和短期性，监管机构通常要求借款人具备较强的还款能力。  
  **English Significance**：  
  Bridge loans play a crucial role in financial markets, especially during liquidity crunches. They offer flexible financing solutions for businesses and individuals, facilitating smooth transactions and project execution. However, due to their high interest rates and short-term nature, regulators often require borrowers to demonstrate strong repayment capacity.
