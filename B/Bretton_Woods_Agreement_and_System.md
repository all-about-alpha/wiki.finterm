# Bretton Woods Agreement and System

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：布雷顿森林协定与体系是1944年在美国新罕布什尔州布雷顿森林召开的联合国货币金融会议上达成的一项国际货币体系协议。该体系的核心内容包括：建立以美元为中心的国际货币体系，美元与黄金挂钩（35美元兑换1盎司黄金），其他成员国货币与美元挂钩，实行固定汇率制度。国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行（World Bank）也是该体系的产物，旨在促进全球金融稳定和经济复苏。  
  **English Explanation**: The Bretton Woods Agreement and System refers to an international monetary system established in 1944 at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA. The core elements of the system included the creation of a dollar-centric international monetary framework, where the US dollar was pegged to gold (at $35 per ounce), and other member currencies were pegged to the US dollar under a fixed exchange rate regime. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank were also established as part of this system to promote global financial stability and economic recovery.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：布雷顿森林体系在二战后为全球经济复苏提供了稳定的货币环境，促进了国际贸易和投资。其应用场景包括：成员国通过固定汇率制度减少汇率波动风险，IMF为成员国提供短期资金支持以应对国际收支危机，世界银行则提供长期贷款支持战后重建和发展项目。然而，该体系也存在风险，如美元作为唯一储备货币的“特里芬难题”（Triffin Dilemma），即美元供应与黄金储备之间的矛盾。  
  **English Explanation**: The Bretton Woods System provided a stable monetary environment for global economic recovery after World War II, facilitating international trade and investment. Its applications included member countries reducing exchange rate volatility risks through the fixed exchange rate system, the IMF offering short-term financial support to address balance-of-payments crises, and the World Bank providing long-term loans for post-war reconstruction and development projects. However, the system also faced risks, such as the "Triffin Dilemma," where the US dollar's role as the sole reserve currency conflicted with its gold reserves.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：布雷顿森林体系在金融监管、投资和产业发展方面具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它确立了国际货币合作的基本框架，为后续国际金融体系的改革奠定了基础。从投资角度看，稳定的汇率环境降低了跨国投资的风险。从产业角度看，世界银行的贷款支持了发展中国家基础设施建设和工业化进程。  
  **English Explanation**: The Bretton Woods System holds significant importance in financial regulation, investment, and industrial development. From a regulatory perspective, it established the foundational framework for international monetary cooperation, paving the way for subsequent reforms in the global financial system. From an investment perspective, the stable exchange rate environment reduced risks for cross-border investments. From an industrial perspective, the World Bank's loans supported infrastructure development and industrialization in developing countries.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：布雷顿森林体系的起源可以追溯到二战后期，当时全球经济因战争而陷入混乱。1944年7月，44个盟国代表在美国新罕布什尔州的布雷顿森林召开会议，旨在设计战后国际货币体系。会议由美国经济学家哈里·怀特（Harry Dexter White）和英国经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）主导，最终达成了以美元为中心的固定汇率体系。  
  **English Explanation**: The origins of the Bretton Woods System trace back to the late stages of World War II, when the global economy was in disarray due to the war. In July 1944, representatives from 44 Allied nations convened in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA, to design a post-war international monetary system. The conference was led by American economist Harry Dexter White and British economist John Maynard Keynes, resulting in the establishment of a dollar-centric fixed exchange rate system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：布雷顿森林体系对全球经济产生了深远影响。在其实施期间（1944-1971年），全球贸易和投资显著增长，世界经济进入“黄金时代”。然而，由于美元供应过剩和黄金储备不足，该体系于1971年崩溃，被浮动汇率制度取代。尽管如此，其遗产仍存续至今，IMF和世界银行继续在全球经济治理中发挥重要作用。  
  **English Explanation**: The Bretton Woods System had a profound impact on the global economy. During its operation (1944-1971), global trade and investment grew significantly, ushering in a "golden age" for the world economy. However, due to excessive dollar supply and insufficient gold reserves, the system collapsed in 1971 and was replaced by a floating exchange rate regime. Despite this, its legacy endures, with the IMF and World Bank continuing to play vital roles in global economic governance.
