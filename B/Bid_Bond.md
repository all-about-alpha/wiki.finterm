# Bid Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  投标保证金（Bid Bond）是指投标人在参与招标项目时，向招标方提供的一种财务担保，以确保投标人遵守招标文件中的条款和条件。如果投标人中标后未能履行合同义务，招标方有权没收该保证金。投标保证金通常由银行或保险公司出具，金额一般为合同总价的一定比例。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A bid bond is a financial guarantee provided by a bidder to the tendering party when participating in a bidding project, ensuring that the bidder adheres to the terms and conditions outlined in the tender documents. If the bidder fails to fulfill the contract obligations after winning the bid, the tendering party has the right to forfeit the bond. Bid bonds are typically issued by banks or insurance companies and are usually a percentage of the total contract value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  投标保证金广泛应用于建筑工程、政府采购、大型设备采购等领域。其主要作用是防止投标人随意撤标或中标后不履行合同，从而保障招标方的利益。需要注意的是，投标人需确保保证金的有效性和及时性，否则可能导致投标无效。  
  **English Application**  
  Bid bonds are widely used in construction projects, government procurement, and large-scale equipment procurement. Their primary purpose is to prevent bidders from withdrawing their bids arbitrarily or failing to fulfill the contract after winning the bid, thereby protecting the interests of the tendering party. It is important for bidders to ensure the validity and timeliness of the bond, as failure to do so may result in the bid being disqualified.
