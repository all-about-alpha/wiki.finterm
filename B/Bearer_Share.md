# Bearer Share

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  不记名股票（Bearer Share）是一种无需在发行公司登记持有人信息的股票形式。持有该股票的人即被视为合法所有者，享有股票所附带的所有权利，如分红和投票权。不记名股票通常以实物形式存在，持有者通过占有股票来证明所有权。由于其匿名性，不记名股票在某些司法管辖区被用于避税、洗钱等非法活动，因此许多国家已逐步禁止或限制其发行和流通。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A bearer share is a type of equity security that is not registered in the name of a specific owner. The person who physically holds the share certificate is considered the legal owner and is entitled to all rights associated with the share, such as dividends and voting rights. Bearer shares are typically issued in physical form, and ownership is transferred simply by delivering the certificate. Due to their anonymity, bearer shares have been used in some jurisdictions for tax evasion, money laundering, and other illicit activities, leading many countries to ban or restrict their issuance and circulation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  不记名股票曾广泛应用于欧洲和拉丁美洲等地区，特别是在20世纪中期。由于其匿名性和易于转让的特点，不记名股票常被用于跨境投资和资产保护。然而，由于其容易被滥用于非法活动，许多国家（如瑞士、英国等）已逐步取消或严格限制不记名股票的发行。目前，不记名股票的使用主要集中在少数允许其存在的离岸金融中心。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Bearer shares were widely used in regions such as Europe and Latin America, particularly in the mid-20th century. Due to their anonymity and ease of transfer, they were often utilized for cross-border investments and asset protection. However, because of their potential for misuse in illegal activities, many countries (e.g., Switzerland, the UK) have phased out or heavily restricted their issuance. Today, bearer shares are primarily used in a few offshore financial centers where they are still permitted.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度来看，不记名股票的匿名性使其成为反洗钱和反恐融资监管的重点对象。许多国家和国际组织（如金融行动特别工作组，FATF）已将其列为高风险金融工具。从投资角度来看，不记名股票为投资者提供了隐私保护，但也增加了交易风险，因为所有权难以追溯。从行业角度来看，不记名股票的逐步淘汰反映了全球金融透明化的趋势。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the anonymity of bearer shares makes them a focal point for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) efforts. Many countries and international organizations (e.g., the Financial Action Task Force, FATF) have classified them as high-risk financial instruments. From an investment standpoint, bearer shares offer privacy but also increase transaction risks due to the difficulty of tracing ownership. From an industry perspective, the gradual phasing out of bearer shares reflects the global trend toward financial transparency.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  不记名股票的起源可以追溯到19世纪欧洲的资本市场。当时，为了方便股票交易和转让，许多公司开始发行不记名股票。这种形式在20世纪初达到顶峰，尤其是在瑞士和卢森堡等金融中心。然而，随着全球金融监管的加强，不记名股票的匿名性逐渐被视为一种漏洞，导致其在21世纪初被逐步淘汰。  
  **English Origin**  
  The origin of bearer shares dates back to the 19th-century European capital markets. To facilitate the trading and transfer of shares, many companies began issuing bearer shares. This practice peaked in the early 20th century, particularly in financial hubs like Switzerland and Luxembourg. However, as global financial regulations tightened, the anonymity of bearer shares came to be seen as a loophole, leading to their gradual phase-out in the early 21st century.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  不记名股票的匿名性曾对全球金融市场产生深远影响。一方面，它促进了跨境资本流动和投资便利化；另一方面，它也助长了非法金融活动。随着各国监管政策的收紧，不记名股票的使用大幅减少，但其历史影响仍体现在现代金融工具的设计中。目前，大多数国家已要求股票必须登记持有人信息，以确保金融交易的透明性。  
  **English Impact**  
  The anonymity of bearer shares has had a profound impact on global financial markets. On one hand, it facilitated cross-border capital flows and investment convenience; on the other hand, it enabled illicit financial activities. As regulatory policies tightened worldwide, the use of bearer shares declined significantly, but their historical influence is still reflected in the design of modern financial instruments. Today, most countries require shares to be registered to ensure transparency in financial transactions.
