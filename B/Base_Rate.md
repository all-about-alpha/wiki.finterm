  **English Explanation**: The Base Rate is the fundamental interest rate set by a central bank or monetary authority to influence market interest rates and the money supply.

  **中文解释**：基准利率广泛应用于商业银行的贷款和存款定价中。例如，当央行降低基准利率时，商业银行的贷款利率通常也会下降，从而刺激企业和个人的借贷需求，促进经济增长。然而，基准利率的调整也可能带来通货膨胀或资产泡沫等风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The Base Rate is widely used in the pricing of loans and deposits by commercial banks. For instance, when a central bank lowers the Base Rate, commercial banks typically reduce their lending rates, stimulating borrowing demand among businesses and individuals and promoting economic growth. However, adjustments to the Base Rate may also carry risks such as inflation or asset bubbles.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：基准利率的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初，随着现代中央银行制度的建立而逐步形成。例如，美国联邦储备系统（美联储）在1913年成立后，开始通过调整贴现率（一种早期的基准利率形式）来调控经济。中国的基准利率体系则是在改革开放后逐步建立和完善的，1996年中国人民银行首次公布贷款基准利率。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the Base Rate can be traced back to the early 20th century, evolving alongside the establishment of modern central banking systems. For example, after the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) was founded in 1913, it began regulating the economy by adjusting the discount rate, an early form of the Base Rate. In China, the Base Rate system was gradually established and refined after the reform and opening-up, with the People's Bank of China first announcing the loan Base Rate in 1996.

* **影响 / Impact**
