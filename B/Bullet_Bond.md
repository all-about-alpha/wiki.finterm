# Bullet Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  子弹债券（Bullet Bond）是一种固定收益债券，其特点是在债券到期时一次性偿还本金，而不是在债券期限内分期偿还。这种债券通常在整个存续期内支付固定利息，到期时一次性支付全部本金。子弹债券的名称来源于其“一次性偿还”的特性，类似于子弹发射后一次性击中目标。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Bullet Bond is a type of fixed-income bond where the principal is repaid in a single lump sum at maturity, rather than being amortized over the life of the bond. This bond typically pays a fixed interest rate throughout its term, with the entire principal amount repaid at the end of the bond's life. The name "Bullet Bond" derives from its "one-time repayment" feature, akin to a bullet hitting its target in a single shot.

Due to their single lump-sum repayment feature, Bullet Bonds are suitable for entities that wish to maintain stable cash flow during the bond's term.
