  **中文解释**：  
  “Bucket Shop” 是指一种非法的或不受监管的金融交易场所，通常从事投机性交易或欺诈活动。这类机构通常不将客户的订单提交到正规交易所执行，而是通过内部对赌的方式与客户进行交易，从而牟取暴利。其名称源于19世纪末的美国，最初指代一些小型、非法的股票交易场所。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A "Bucket Shop" refers to an illegal or unregulated financial trading venue, typically engaged in speculative trading or fraudulent activities.

  **English Application**：  
  Bucket Shops often operate in high-risk speculative trading, such as forex, contracts for difference (CFDs), or cryptocurrency trading. They exploit investors' desire for high returns through false advertising and price manipulation. Investors should be wary of such entities due to their lack of regulation, unsecured funds, and potential manipulation of trading outcomes.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  Bucket Shop 的起源可以追溯到19世纪末的美国。当时，一些小型、非法的股票交易场所通过内部对赌的方式与客户交易，而非将订单提交到正规交易所。这些场所通常位于地下室或简陋的房间，被称为“Bucket Shops”，因其交易方式类似于将客户的资金“倒入桶中”进行对赌。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The origin of Bucket Shops dates back to the late 19th century in the United States. At that time, small, illegal stock trading venues engaged in internal betting against clients instead of submitting orders to legitimate exchanges. These venues were often located in basements or简陋的房间 and were called "Bucket Shops" because their trading methods resembled "pouring clients' funds into a bucket" for betting.
