# Bank Reserve

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：银行准备金（Bank Reserve）是指商业银行根据中央银行的规定，必须保留的一部分存款资金，以应对客户的提款需求和支付清算。这一制度起源于中央银行对货币供应量的调控需求，核心概念包括法定准备金率（Required Reserve Ratio）和超额准备金（Excess Reserves）。  
  **English Explanation**: Bank reserves refer to the portion of deposits that commercial banks are required to hold by the central bank to meet customer withdrawal demands and payment settlements. This system originated from the central bank's need to regulate the money supply, with core concepts including the required reserve ratio and excess reserves.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：银行准备金的应用场景主要包括商业银行的日常运营和中央银行的货币政策调控。例如，当中央银行提高法定准备金率时，商业银行需要保留更多的资金，从而减少可贷资金量，抑制经济过热。风险方面，准备金不足可能导致银行流动性危机，影响金融稳定。  
  **English Explanation**: Bank reserves are primarily used in the daily operations of commercial banks and the monetary policy adjustments of central banks. For instance, when the central bank raises the required reserve ratio, commercial banks must hold more funds, reducing the amount available for lending and curbing economic overheating. Risks include potential liquidity crises due to insufficient reserves, which can threaten financial stability.
