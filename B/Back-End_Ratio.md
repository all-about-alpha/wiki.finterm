# Back-End Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：后端比率（Back-End Ratio），也称为债务收入比，是指借款人每月总债务支出占其月总收入的比例。这一比率通常用于评估借款人的偿债能力，特别是在申请抵押贷款时。核心概念包括总债务支出（如房贷、车贷、信用卡还款等）和总收入（税前或税后收入）。  
  **English Explanation**: The Back-End Ratio, also known as the Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI), measures the percentage of a borrower's monthly gross income that goes toward paying all monthly debt obligations. This ratio is commonly used to assess a borrower's ability to manage debt, particularly when applying for a mortgage. Key components include total monthly debt payments (such as mortgage, car loans, credit card payments) and gross monthly income (before or after taxes).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：后端比率广泛应用于银行和金融机构的贷款审批过程中，特别是在抵押贷款、个人贷款和信用卡申请中。金融机构通常设定一个后端比率的上限（如36%或43%），超过此限的借款人可能被视为高风险客户。风险提示：过高的后端比率可能导致借款人无法按时还款，增加违约风险。  
  **English Application**: The Back-End Ratio is widely used in loan approval processes by banks and financial institutions, especially for mortgages, personal loans, and credit card applications. Lenders typically set a maximum Back-End Ratio (e.g., 36% or 43%), and borrowers exceeding this limit may be considered high-risk. Risk Note: A high Back-End Ratio may indicate difficulty in meeting monthly payments, increasing the risk of default.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，后端比率是评估借款人财务健康状况的重要指标，有助于防范系统性金融风险。从投资角度看，低后端比率的借款人通常被视为更可靠的贷款对象。从行业角度看，后端比率的合理设定有助于维护金融市场的稳定性和可持续性。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the Back-End Ratio is a critical metric for assessing a borrower's financial health and mitigating systemic financial risks. From an investment standpoint, borrowers with a low Back-End Ratio are generally considered more reliable. From an industry perspective, setting appropriate Back-End Ratio limits helps maintain the stability and sustainability of financial markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：后端比率的概念起源于20世纪中期的美国银行业，当时金融机构开始系统化评估借款人的偿债能力。1970年代，随着消费者信贷的普及，后端比率逐渐成为贷款审批的核心指标之一。1990年代，美国联邦住房金融局（FHFA）正式将后端比率纳入抵押贷款审批标准。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of the Back-End Ratio originated in the mid-20th century within the U.S. banking industry, as financial institutions began systematically evaluating borrowers' debt repayment capabilities. During the 1970s, with the rise of consumer credit, the Back-End Ratio became a key metric in loan approvals. In the 1990s, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) formally incorporated the Back-End Ratio into mortgage underwriting standards.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：后端比率的引入显著提高了贷款审批的科学性和透明度，减少了不良贷款的发生。目前，后端比率已成为全球金融机构评估借款人信用风险的重要工具，特别是在住房贷款领域。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of the Back-End Ratio significantly enhanced the scientific rigor and transparency of loan approvals, reducing the incidence of non-performing loans. Today, the Back-End Ratio is a vital tool for global financial institutions in assessing borrower credit risk, particularly in the mortgage sector.
