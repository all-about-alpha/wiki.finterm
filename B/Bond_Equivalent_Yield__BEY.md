# Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    债券等价收益率（Bond Equivalent Yield, BEY）是一种将短期债券（如国库券）的贴现收益率转换为年化收益率的方法，以便与长期债券的收益率进行比较。它通常用于将半年付息一次的债券收益率转换为年化收益率，便于投资者在不同期限的债券之间进行横向比较。BEY的核心概念是将非年化收益率标准化为年化收益率，从而简化收益率的比较和分析。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) is a method used to convert the discount yield of short-term bonds (such as Treasury bills) into an annualized yield, making it comparable to the yields of long-term bonds. It is commonly used to convert semi-annual bond yields into annualized yields, enabling investors to compare bonds with different maturities on a standardized basis. The core concept of BEY is to standardize non-annualized yields into annualized yields, simplifying yield comparisons and analysis.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    BEY广泛应用于债券市场，特别是在比较短期国库券和长期债券时。例如，投资者可以使用BEY将90天国库券的贴现收益率转换为年化收益率，以便与10年期国债的收益率进行比较。此外，BEY也常用于计算零息债券的收益率。需要注意的是，BEY假设利息按半年复利计算，因此在某些情况下可能与实际收益率存在差异。  
  - **English Application**  
    BEY is widely used in the bond market, particularly when comparing short-term Treasury bills with long-term bonds. For example, investors can use BEY to convert the discount yield of a 90-day Treasury bill into an annualized yield, making it comparable to the yield of a 10-year Treasury bond. Additionally, BEY is often used to calculate the yield of zero-coupon bonds. It is important to note that BEY assumes semi-annual compounding, which may result in discrepancies with actual yields in certain scenarios.

* **重要性 / Significance**

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    债券等价收益率的概念起源于20世纪中期，随着债券市场的快速发展，投资者需要一种标准化的方法来比较不同期限债券的收益率。特别是在美国国库券市场，短期国库券通常以贴现方式发行，而长期债券则以票面利率发行。为了便于比较，金融界提出了BEY的概念，将短期债券的贴现收益率转换为年化收益率。这一方法逐渐被市场广泛接受，并成为债券分析的重要工具。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of Bond Equivalent Yield originated in the mid-20th century as the bond market rapidly expanded, and investors needed a standardized method to compare yields across bonds with different maturities. Particularly in the U.S. Treasury market, short-term Treasury bills were typically issued at a discount, while long-term bonds were issued with coupon rates. To facilitate comparisons, the financial industry introduced BEY, converting the discount yield of short-term bonds into an annualized yield. This method gradually gained widespread acceptance and became a crucial tool in bond analysis.
