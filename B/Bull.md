## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  “牛市”一词的起源可以追溯到18世纪的英国金融市场。当时，伦敦证券交易所的投资者用“bull”和“bear”分别形容市场上涨和下跌的趋势。这一比喻源于动物斗兽场中牛和熊的攻击方式，牛向上顶，熊向下拍。  
  **English Origin**  
  The term "bull market" dates back to 18th-century British financial markets. Investors at the London Stock Exchange used "bull" and "bear" to describe rising and falling market trends, respectively. This metaphor stems from the way bulls and bears attack in animal fights—bulls thrust upward, while bears swipe downward.

  牛市对金融市场和实体经济具有深远影响。例如，20世纪90年代的美国科技股牛市推动了互联网行业的快速发展，但也导致了2000年的互联网泡沫破裂。当前，全球牛市周期与货币政策、科技创新等因素密切相关。  
  **English Impact**  
  Bull markets have profound impacts on financial markets and the real economy. For instance, the 1990s tech bull market in the U.S. accelerated the growth of the internet industry but also led to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Today, global bull market cycles are closely tied to monetary policies, technological innovation, and other factors.
