# Bill of Lading

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    提单（Bill of Lading，简称B/L）是由承运人或其代理人签发的，证明货物已接收或装船，并承诺将货物运至指定目的地交付给指定收货人的一种运输单据。它是国际贸易中最重要的单证之一，具有货物收据、运输合同证明和物权凭证的三重功能。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Bill of Lading (B/L) is a document issued by a carrier or their agent, acknowledging the receipt or loading of goods and committing to transport them to a specified destination for delivery to a designated consignee. It is one of the most critical documents in international trade, serving three primary functions: a receipt for goods, evidence of the contract of carriage, and a document of title.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    提单广泛应用于国际贸易和海运领域。在货物装船后，承运人签发提单给托运人，托运人可凭此单据办理结汇、保险等手续。收货人则需凭正本提单提货。需要注意的是，提单的遗失或伪造可能导致货物无法正常交付，因此需妥善保管。  
  - **English Application**  
    The Bill of Lading is widely used in international trade and maritime shipping. After goods are loaded onto a vessel, the carrier issues the B/L to the shipper, who can then use it to complete procedures such as settlement of payment and insurance. The consignee must present the original B/L to take delivery of the goods. It is crucial to safeguard the B/L, as its loss or forgery can lead to delivery issues.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    提单在国际贸易中具有法律效力，是货物所有权的凭证。它不仅是买卖双方结算货款的重要依据，也是银行信用证业务的核心单据之一。从行业角度看，提单的规范使用有助于降低贸易风险，促进物流和资金流的顺畅运转。  
  - **English Significance**  
    The Bill of Lading holds legal significance in international trade as a document of title. It serves as a critical basis for payment settlement between buyers and sellers and is a core document in letter of credit transactions. From an industry perspective, the standardized use of B/L helps mitigate trade risks and facilitates the smooth flow of goods and funds.
