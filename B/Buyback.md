# Buyback

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    回购（Buyback）是指公司利用自有资金或借贷资金从公开市场或股东手中购回其已发行的股票的行为。这一行为通常由公司董事会授权，旨在减少流通股数量，提升每股收益（EPS），或向市场传递公司股价被低估的信号。回购的核心概念包括股票注销、资本结构调整以及股东价值提升。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A buyback, also known as a share repurchase, refers to a company's action of purchasing its own shares from the open market or directly from shareholders using its own funds or borrowed capital. This action is typically authorized by the company's board of directors and aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares, increase earnings per share (EPS), or signal to the market that the company's stock is undervalued. Key concepts include share cancellation, capital restructuring, and shareholder value enhancement.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    回购常用于以下场景：  
    1. **提升股价**：当公司认为其股价被低估时，通过回购减少流通股数量，从而支撑股价。  
    2. **优化资本结构**：通过回购减少股本，降低资本成本，提高财务灵活性。  
    3. **股东回报**：作为现金分红的替代方案，回购可以直接增加股东权益。  
    4. **抵御恶意收购**：通过回购减少流通股，增加潜在收购方的难度。

  - **English Application**  
    Buybacks are commonly used in the following scenarios:  
    1. **Boosting Stock Price**: When a company believes its stock is undervalued, it may repurchase shares to reduce the number of outstanding shares and support the stock price.  
    2. **Optimizing Capital Structure**: By reducing equity through buybacks, a company can lower its cost of capital and improve financial flexibility.  
    3. **Shareholder Returns**: As an alternative to cash dividends, buybacks can directly enhance shareholder equity.  
    4. **Defending Against Hostile Takeovers**: Reducing the number of outstanding shares through buybacks can make it more difficult for potential acquirers to gain control.  
    **Risk Notes**: Buybacks can be misused, such as when management uses them to artificially inflate stock prices for short-term gains rather than genuinely improving company value. Additionally, excessive reliance on borrowed funds for buybacks can increase financial risk.
