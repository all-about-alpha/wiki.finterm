# Bollinger Band

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **布林带（Bollinger Band）** 是由约翰·布林格（John Bollinger）在1980年代发明的一种技术分析工具。它由三条线组成：中间线是移动平均线（通常为20日简单移动平均线），上下两条线分别是中间线加减两倍标准差形成的带状区间。布林带的核心概念是通过标准差衡量价格的波动性，从而判断市场的超买或超卖状态。  
  **Bollinger Band** is a technical analysis tool invented by John Bollinger in the 1980s. It consists of three lines: the middle line is a moving average (typically a 20-day simple moving average), and the upper and lower lines are formed by adding and subtracting twice the standard deviation from the middle line. The core concept of Bollinger Bands is to measure price volatility through standard deviation, thereby identifying overbought or oversold market conditions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  布林带广泛应用于股票、外汇、期货等金融市场。投资者通过观察价格是否触及或突破布林带的上下轨，来判断市场趋势的强弱或反转信号。例如，当价格触及上轨时，可能表明市场处于超买状态，存在回调风险；当价格触及下轨时，可能表明市场处于超卖状态，存在反弹机会。需要注意的是，布林带在震荡市场中效果较好，但在趋势市场中可能出现假信号。  
  Bollinger Bands are widely used in financial markets such as stocks, forex, and futures. Investors observe whether prices touch or break through the upper or lower bands to gauge the strength of market trends or potential reversal signals. For example, when prices touch the upper band, it may indicate an overbought market with potential pullback risks; when prices touch the lower band, it may indicate an oversold market with potential rebound opportunities. It is important to note that Bollinger Bands perform well in ranging markets but may generate false signals in trending markets.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  布林带在技术分析中具有重要意义，因为它不仅能够反映价格波动性，还能为投资者提供明确的买卖信号。从监管角度看，布林带被广泛认可为一种有效的风险管理工具；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者识别市场情绪和趋势变化；从行业角度看，布林带已成为量化交易和算法交易中的重要指标之一。  
  Bollinger Bands hold significant importance in technical analysis as they not only reflect price volatility but also provide clear buy and sell signals for investors. From a regulatory perspective, Bollinger Bands are widely recognized as an effective risk management tool; from an investment perspective, they help investors identify market sentiment and trend changes; from an industry perspective, Bollinger Bands have become a key indicator in quantitative and algorithmic trading.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  布林带由美国金融分析师约翰·布林格（John Bollinger）于1983年发明。布林格在分析股票价格波动时，发现传统的移动平均线无法有效反映市场波动性，因此他结合统计学中的标准差概念，开发了布林带这一工具。布林带的发明标志着技术分析领域的一次重要创新，为投资者提供了更精确的市场分析手段。  
  Bollinger Bands were invented by American financial analyst John Bollinger in 1983. While analyzing stock price volatility, Bollinger found that traditional moving averages were insufficient in reflecting market volatility. Therefore, he incorporated the concept of standard deviation from statistics to develop Bollinger Bands. The invention of Bollinger Bands marked a significant innovation in the field of technical analysis, providing investors with more precise market analysis tools.
