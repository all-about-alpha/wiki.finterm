# Billing Cycle

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  账单周期（Billing Cycle）是指企业或服务提供商为消费者生成账单的时间段，通常以月为单位，但也可能根据业务需求设置为其他周期（如周、季度等）。账单周期内记录消费者使用的服务或购买的商品，并在周期结束时生成账单，要求消费者支付相应费用。核心概念包括计费起始日、计费结束日和账单生成日。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A billing cycle refers to the period during which a business or service provider generates a bill for a consumer, typically on a monthly basis, though it may also be set as weekly, quarterly, or other intervals depending on business needs. It records the services used or goods purchased by the consumer during the cycle and generates a bill at the end of the period, requiring the consumer to pay the corresponding fees. Key concepts include the billing start date, billing end date, and bill generation date.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  账单周期广泛应用于电信、信用卡、公用事业（如水、电、燃气）和订阅服务（如流媒体、软件订阅）等领域。例如，电信公司每月统计用户的通话、短信和流量使用情况，并在账单周期结束时生成账单。风险提示：消费者需注意账单周期的起始和结束时间，避免因延迟支付而产生滞纳金或影响信用记录。  
  **English Application**  
  Billing cycles are widely used in industries such as telecommunications, credit cards, utilities (e.g., water, electricity, gas), and subscription services (e.g., streaming platforms, software subscriptions). For example, telecom companies track users' call, text, and data usage monthly and generate bills at the end of the billing cycle. Risk note: Consumers should pay attention to the start and end dates of the billing cycle to avoid late payment fees or negative impacts on credit records.
