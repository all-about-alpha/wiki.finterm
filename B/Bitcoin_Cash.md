## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    Bitcoin Cash（比特币现金）是一种基于比特币区块链的分叉加密货币，于2017年8月1日诞生。其核心目标是解决比特币网络交易拥堵和高手续费的问题，通过将区块大小从1MB提升至8MB（后续进一步扩大），从而提高交易处理能力。Bitcoin Cash的创始团队主要由对比特币扩容方案持不同意见的开发者和社区成员组成。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that originated as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain on August 1, 2017. Its primary goal is to address the issues of network congestion and high transaction fees associated with Bitcoin by increasing the block size from 1MB to 8MB (and later further expanded), thereby enhancing transaction processing capacity. The founding team of Bitcoin Cash primarily consisted of developers and community members who disagreed with Bitcoin's scaling solutions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    Bitcoin Cash主要用于点对点支付场景，因其较低的手续费和较快的交易确认速度，适合小额支付和日常交易。它也被一些商家接受作为支付方式，尤其是在加密货币友好的地区。然而，投资者需注意其价格波动较大，且与比特币相比，市场接受度和流动性相对较低。  
  - **English Application**  
    Bitcoin Cash is primarily used for peer-to-peer payments, making it suitable for small transactions and daily use due to its low fees and faster confirmation times. It is also accepted by some merchants as a payment method, particularly in cryptocurrency-friendly regions. However, investors should be aware of its high price volatility and relatively lower market acceptance and liquidity compared to Bitcoin.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，Bitcoin Cash作为比特币的分叉币，引发了关于加密货币分叉合法性和技术路线的广泛讨论。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了另一种选择，但其价值波动性较高，需谨慎对待。从行业角度看，Bitcoin Cash的出现推动了区块链扩容技术的发展，促进了加密货币支付生态的多样化。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, Bitcoin Cash, as a fork of Bitcoin, has sparked extensive discussions on the legitimacy and technical approaches of cryptocurrency forks. From an investment perspective, it offers an alternative option, but its high volatility requires cautious consideration. From an industry perspective, the emergence of Bitcoin Cash has driven advancements in blockchain scaling technologies and diversified the cryptocurrency payment ecosystem.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    Bitcoin Cash的诞生源于比特币社区内部关于扩容问题的长期争论。2017年，随着比特币网络交易量激增，交易拥堵和高手续费问题日益严重。部分开发者和矿工主张通过扩大区块容量（即“大区块”方案）来解决这一问题，而另一部分则支持隔离见证（SegWit）等方案。最终，支持大区块的阵营选择分叉，创建了Bitcoin Cash。  
  - **English Origin**  
    Bitcoin Cash originated from a long-standing debate within the Bitcoin community over scaling solutions. In 2017, as Bitcoin's network transaction volume surged, issues of congestion and high fees became increasingly severe. Some developers and miners advocated for increasing the block size (the "big block" approach), while others supported solutions like Segregated Witness (SegWit). Ultimately, the big block faction chose to fork, creating Bitcoin Cash.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**  
    Bitcoin Cash的出现对加密货币行业产生了深远影响。它推动了区块链扩容技术的探索，并促使更多项目关注交易效率和用户体验。然而，其与比特币的竞争也引发了社区分裂和市场波动。目前，Bitcoin Cash在加密货币市场中占据一定份额，但其影响力和市值仍远低于比特币。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The emergence of Bitcoin Cash has had a profound impact on the cryptocurrency industry. It has spurred exploration into blockchain scaling technologies and encouraged more projects to focus on transaction efficiency and user experience. However, its competition with Bitcoin has also led to community division and market volatility. Currently, Bitcoin Cash holds a certain share in the cryptocurrency market, but its influence and market capitalization remain significantly lower than Bitcoin's.
