## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  不良信用的概念起源于19世纪末的欧美国家，随着现代银行体系的建立和信用评级机构的出现而逐步形成。20世纪初，美国成立了第一家信用评级机构，标志着信用评估体系的正式建立。中国的不良信用记录管理起步较晚，直到2006年中国人民银行征信中心成立，才逐步建立起全国统一的信用信息数据库。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of bad credit originated in Europe and the United States in the late 19th century, evolving alongside the development of modern banking systems and credit rating agencies. The first credit rating agency in the U.S. was established in the early 20th century, marking the formalization of credit assessment systems. In China, bad credit management started later, with the establishment of the People's Bank of China Credit Reference Center in 2006, which gradually built a nationwide credit information database.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  不良信用对个人和企业的影响深远。个人可能难以获得贷款或信用卡，企业则可能面临融资困难和高额利息。近年来，随着中国信用体系的完善，不良信用记录的修复机制逐步建立，但仍需加强公众的信用意识。  
  **English Impact**：  
  Bad credit has profound impacts on individuals and businesses. Individuals may struggle to obtain loans or credit cards, while businesses may face financing difficulties and high-interest rates. In recent years, with the improvement of China's credit system, mechanisms for repairing bad credit records have been established, but public awareness of creditworthiness still needs to be strengthened.
