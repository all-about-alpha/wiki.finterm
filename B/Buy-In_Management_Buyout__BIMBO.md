# Buy-In Management Buyout (BIMBO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    买入式管理层收购（BIMBO）是一种并购交易形式，结合了管理层收购（MBO）和管理层买入（MBI）的特点。在这种交易中，现有管理层与外部新管理层共同合作，通过融资收购公司股权，从而实现对公司的控制。通常，现有管理层保留部分职位，而外部管理层则引入新的管理经验和资源。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Buy-In Management Buyout (BIMBO) is a form of merger and acquisition that combines elements of a Management Buyout (MBO) and a Management Buy-In (MBI). In this transaction, the existing management team collaborates with external new managers to acquire the company's equity through financing, thereby gaining control of the company. Typically, the existing management retains some positions, while the external managers bring in new management expertise and resources.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景与风险提示**  
    BIMBO常用于企业重组、家族企业传承或私有化过程中。其优势在于结合了内部管理层的行业经验与外部管理层的创新视角，有助于提升公司运营效率。然而，这种模式也存在风险，如管理层之间的权力分配冲突、融资压力以及整合失败的可能性。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    BIMBO is often used in corporate restructuring, family business succession, or privatization processes. Its advantage lies in combining the industry experience of internal management with the innovative perspectives of external managers, which can enhance operational efficiency. However, this model also carries risks, such as conflicts over power distribution between management teams, financing pressures, and the potential for integration failure.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管、投资和行业角度来看，BIMBO为企业提供了一种灵活的并购方式，既能保留内部管理层的稳定性，又能引入外部资源推动变革。对于投资者而言，BIMBO可能带来更高的回报，但也需关注其潜在风险。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, BIMBO offers a flexible approach to mergers and acquisitions, preserving the stability of internal management while introducing external resources to drive change. For investors, BIMBO may yield higher returns but also requires attention to its inherent risks.
