  **English Explanation**:  
  A "Bag Holder" is a financial term used to describe an investor who is left holding depreciating assets (such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.) and is unable to sell them. These investors typically buy assets at market highs and subsequently become "trapped" as the market declines or the asset value shrinks, ultimately incurring losses. The term originates from the phrase "holding the bag," metaphorically depicting investors as holding a bag filled with losses that they cannot escape.  
  **Core Concepts**: Trapped, losses, inability to sell.
