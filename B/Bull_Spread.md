# Bull Spread

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  牛市价差（Bull Spread）是一种期权交易策略，通常用于投资者预期标的资产价格将上涨时。该策略通过同时买入和卖出相同类型的期权（如看涨期权或看跌期权），但具有不同的执行价格或到期日，以限制潜在损失并控制风险。牛市价差可以分为**看涨牛市价差**（通过买入较低执行价格的看涨期权并卖出较高执行价格的看涨期权构建）和**看跌牛市价差**（通过买入较低执行价格的看跌期权并卖出较高执行价格的看跌期权构建）。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  A Bull Spread is an options trading strategy typically used when investors anticipate a rise in the price of the underlying asset. This strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling the same type of options (such as call or put options) but with different strike prices or expiration dates, aiming to limit potential losses and control risk. Bull Spreads can be categorized into **Bull Call Spreads** (constructed by buying a lower strike price call option and selling a higher strike price call option) and **Bull Put Spreads** (constructed by buying a lower strike price put option and selling a higher strike price put option).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：  
  牛市价差常用于投资者对市场持温和看涨态度时。例如，在看涨牛市价差中，投资者通过买入低执行价格的看涨期权获得上涨收益，同时通过卖出高执行价格的看涨期权降低权利金成本。这种策略适用于标的资产价格小幅上涨的预期，且在市场波动性较低时效果更佳。需要注意的是，牛市价差的收益和损失均有限，适合风险承受能力较低的投资者。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Bull Spreads are often used when investors hold a moderately bullish view of the market. For example, in a Bull Call Spread, investors gain upside potential by buying a lower strike price call option while reducing premium costs by selling a higher strike price call option. This strategy is suitable for scenarios where the underlying asset is expected to rise modestly and performs better in low-volatility markets. It is important to note that both the profit and loss of a Bull Spread are limited, making it suitable for risk-averse investors.
