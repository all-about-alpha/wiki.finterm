# Bottom-Up Investing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：自下而上投资法（Bottom-Up Investing）是一种投资策略，强调通过分析个别公司的基本面（如财务状况、管理团队、市场竞争力等）来选择投资标的，而不是从宏观经济或行业趋势入手。这种方法的核心在于“由小见大”，即通过深入研究具体公司来构建投资组合，而不受整体市场或行业表现的过度影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Bottom-Up Investing is an investment strategy that emphasizes selecting investment targets by analyzing the fundamentals of individual companies (such as financial health, management team, market competitiveness, etc.), rather than starting from macroeconomic or industry trends. The core concept is "seeing the big picture through the small details," meaning that investment portfolios are constructed through in-depth research of specific companies, without being overly influenced by overall market or industry performance.
