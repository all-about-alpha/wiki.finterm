  **English Application**: Buyer's markets are commonly seen in real estate, used cars, and retail goods. For instance, in a real estate market with excess supply, homebuyers can purchase properties at lower prices and may receive additional incentives. However, it is important to note that a buyer's market can lead to reduced profits or even losses for sellers.
