* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “Buy the Dips” 是一种投资策略，指在市场或某只股票价格短暂下跌时买入，以期在价格回升时获利。这一策略的核心逻辑是“低买高卖”，认为市场的短期下跌是暂时的，长期趋势仍将向上。该策略通常被短线交易者和长期投资者共同使用，但需要结合市场分析和风险管理。  
  **English Explanation**:  
  "Buy the Dips" is an investment strategy that involves purchasing assets when their prices experience a temporary decline, with the expectation of profiting when prices rebound.

This strategy is commonly used by both short-term traders and long-term investors but requires market analysis and risk management.

  **English Application**:  
  This strategy is often applied in volatile markets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. For example, when a stock drops due to short-term negative news, investors may choose to "Buy the Dips" at a lower price, anticipating a rebound in market sentiment to sell at a profit. However, this strategy carries risks; if the downward trend continues, it may lead to losses. Therefore, investors should combine technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and stop-loss strategies.
