# Black Knight

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  在金融领域，“黑骑士”（Black Knight）通常指在敌意收购中，试图强行收购目标公司的一方。与“白骑士”（White Knight）不同，黑骑士的收购意图往往不受目标公司管理层或股东的欢迎，且可能采取激进手段实现收购目标。黑骑士的行为可能包括公开市场收购、代理权争夺或直接向股东提出收购要约。  
  **English Explanation**  
  In finance, a "Black Knight" refers to a party that attempts a hostile takeover of a target company. Unlike a "White Knight," the Black Knight's intentions are often unwelcome by the target company's management or shareholders, and they may employ aggressive tactics to achieve their acquisition goals. These tactics can include open market purchases, proxy fights, or direct tender offers to shareholders.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  黑骑士通常出现在企业并购市场中，尤其是当目标公司具有较高价值但管理层拒绝被收购时。黑骑士可能通过公开市场大量购买目标公司股票，或发起代理权争夺以更换董事会成员，从而推动收购进程。需要注意的是，黑骑士的行为可能引发市场波动，甚至导致目标公司股价剧烈波动，投资者需谨慎评估风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Black Knights typically emerge in the corporate merger and acquisition market, especially when a target company is highly valuable but its management resists being acquired. A Black Knight may purchase a significant amount of the target company's shares in the open market or initiate a proxy fight to replace board members, thereby advancing the acquisition process. It is important to note that the actions of a Black Knight can cause market volatility and even lead to significant fluctuations in the target company's stock price, requiring investors to carefully assess risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，黑骑士的存在促使监管机构加强对敌意收购的审查，以保护中小股东利益。从投资角度看，黑骑士的出现可能为目标公司股东带来短期收益，但也可能引发长期经营风险。从行业角度看，黑骑士的活跃反映了资本市场的竞争性和流动性，同时也可能加剧行业整合。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the presence of Black Knights prompts regulators to strengthen scrutiny of hostile takeovers to protect the interests of minority shareholders. From an investment standpoint, the emergence of a Black Knight may bring short-term gains to the target company's shareholders but could also introduce long-term operational risks. From an industry perspective, the activity of Black Knights reflects the competitiveness and liquidity of capital markets, while potentially accelerating industry consolidation.
