# Bare Trust

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  裸信托（Bare Trust）是一种信托形式，其中受托人（Trustee）仅作为名义上的资产持有者，而受益人（Beneficiary）对信托资产拥有绝对的所有权和支配权。受托人的职责仅限于按照受益人的指示管理和处置资产，不享有任何决策权或利益分配权。裸信托的核心特点是信托资产的收益和风险完全由受益人承担。  

  **English Explanation**：  
  A Bare Trust is a type of trust in which the trustee holds assets in name only, while the beneficiary retains absolute ownership and control over the trust assets. The trustee's role is limited to managing and disposing of the assets as directed by the beneficiary, with no decision-making authority or entitlement to the trust's benefits. The key feature of a Bare Trust is that the beneficiary bears all the risks and rewards associated with the trust assets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  裸信托常用于家庭资产规划、遗产继承和税务优化等场景。例如，父母可以为子女设立裸信托，将资产转移至子女名下，同时保留子女对资产的完全控制权。此外，裸信托也适用于企业资产隔离或特定投资安排。需要注意的是，由于受益人拥有绝对控制权，裸信托可能面临较高的法律和税务风险，需谨慎设计和管理。  

  **English Application**：  
  Bare Trusts are commonly used in family wealth planning, inheritance arrangements, and tax optimization. For instance, parents may establish a Bare Trust for their children, transferring assets to the children while retaining full control over the assets. Additionally, Bare Trusts are suitable for asset segregation in businesses or specific investment arrangements. However, since the beneficiary has absolute control, Bare Trusts may face higher legal and tax risks, requiring careful design and management.
