# Buy Stop Order

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  买入止损订单（Buy Stop Order）是一种在市场价格达到或超过指定价格时自动触发的买入指令。它通常用于投资者希望在价格突破某一关键点位时进场，以避免错过潜在的上涨行情。核心概念包括“止损”和“触发价格”，即当市场价格达到或超过设定的触发价格时，订单自动执行。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Buy Stop Order is an order to buy a security when its price reaches or exceeds a specified level. It is commonly used by investors who want to enter the market when the price breaks through a key resistance level, ensuring they do not miss potential upward trends. The core concepts include "stop" and "trigger price," meaning the order is automatically executed when the market price reaches or surpasses the set trigger price.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  买入止损订单常用于技术分析中，当投资者预期价格突破某一阻力位后会继续上涨时使用。例如，某股票当前价格为50元，投资者认为如果价格突破55元，可能会开启一波上涨行情，因此设置一个55元的买入止损订单。需要注意的是，这种订单在市场波动较大时可能因价格跳空而导致执行价格与预期不符，存在一定风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Buy Stop Orders are often used in technical analysis when investors anticipate that a price breakout above a resistance level will lead to further upward movement. For example, if a stock is currently trading at $50, an investor might set a Buy Stop Order at $55, believing that a breakout above this level could signal a bullish trend. However, in highly volatile markets, the execution price may differ from the expected price due to gaps, introducing potential risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**

  **English Significance**
