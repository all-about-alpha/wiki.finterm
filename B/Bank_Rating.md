## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：银行评级（Bank Rating）是指由专业的信用评级机构或监管机构根据银行的财务状况、风险管理能力、资本充足率、盈利能力、流动性等多方面因素，对银行的信用状况和稳定性进行综合评估并赋予相应等级的过程。这一评级结果通常用于衡量银行的信用风险和偿债能力。  
  **English Explanation**: Bank Rating refers to the process by which professional credit rating agencies or regulatory bodies comprehensively evaluate a bank's creditworthiness and stability based on factors such as financial condition, risk management capabilities, capital adequacy, profitability, and liquidity.

  **English Explanation**: Bank Ratings are widely used by financial institutions, investors, and regulators. For investors, bank ratings serve as a crucial reference for assessing the safety of bank bonds or deposits. For regulators, ratings help identify systemic risks and formulate corresponding regulatory policies. For banks themselves, ratings impact their financing costs and market reputation. It is important to note that ratings are not absolute and may be influenced by the subjective judgment of rating agencies or changes in external environments.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：银行评级的起源可以追溯到20世纪初。1909年，约翰·穆迪（John Moody）首次发布了针对铁路债券的评级，这被视为现代信用评级的开端。随着金融市场的复杂化，评级范围逐渐扩展到银行和其他金融机构。20世纪70年代，全球金融危机的频发促使评级机构进一步完善评级方法，银行评级逐渐成为金融体系的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of bank ratings can be traced back to the early 20th century. In 1909, John Moody published the first ratings for railroad bonds, marking the beginning of modern credit ratings. As financial markets became more complex, the scope of ratings expanded to include banks and other financial institutions. In the 1970s, frequent global financial crises prompted rating agencies to refine their methodologies, and bank ratings gradually became a critical component of the financial system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：银行评级对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。它帮助投资者和监管机构更好地理解银行的风险状况，同时也推动了银行业的透明化和规范化。然而，2008年全球金融危机暴露了评级机构的局限性，例如对复杂金融产品的评级失误。此后，评级机构的独立性和评级方法的科学性成为改革重点。  
  **English Explanation**: Bank Ratings have had a profound impact on the global financial system. They have helped investors and regulators better understand the risk profiles of banks while promoting transparency and standardization in the banking industry. However, the 2008 global financial crisis exposed the limitations of rating agencies, such as misrating complex financial products. Since then, the independence of rating agencies and the scientific rigor of their methodologies have become focal points of reform.
