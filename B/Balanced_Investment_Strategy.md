# Balanced Investment Strategy

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  平衡投资策略是一种投资方法，旨在通过分散投资组合中的资产类别（如股票、债券、现金等）来平衡风险与收益。该策略的核心在于通过资产配置，降低单一资产波动对整体投资组合的影响，从而实现长期稳定的回报。这一概念最早由现代投资组合理论（Modern Portfolio Theory, MPT）的创始人哈里·马科维茨（Harry Markowitz）在20世纪50年代提出。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A balanced investment strategy is an investment approach that aims to balance risk and return by diversifying asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, and cash) within a portfolio. The core idea is to reduce the impact of volatility in any single asset on the overall portfolio through asset allocation, thereby achieving long-term stable returns. This concept was first introduced by Harry Markowitz, the founder of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), in the 1950s.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  平衡投资策略广泛应用于个人理财、养老基金和机构投资等领域。例如，投资者可能会将60%的资金投入股票以追求增长，40%投入债券以降低风险。需要注意的是，尽管该策略能够分散风险，但在市场剧烈波动时，仍可能面临短期亏损。因此，投资者需根据自身的风险承受能力和投资目标调整资产配置比例。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The balanced investment strategy is widely used in personal finance, pension funds, and institutional investments. For example, an investor might allocate 60% of their funds to stocks for growth and 40% to bonds to mitigate risk. It is important to note that while this strategy can diversify risk, it may still face short-term losses during periods of significant market volatility. Therefore, investors need to adjust their asset allocation based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，平衡投资策略具有重要意义。监管机构鼓励投资者采用多元化策略以降低系统性风险；投资者通过平衡策略可以在不同市场环境下保持稳健收益；行业则通过推广这一策略提升整体市场的稳定性。  
  **English Explanation**  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the balanced investment strategy holds significant importance. Regulatory bodies encourage investors to adopt diversified strategies to reduce systemic risks; investors can achieve stable returns across different market conditions through this strategy; and the industry promotes this approach to enhance overall market stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**  
  平衡投资策略的理论基础可以追溯到20世纪50年代，由经济学家哈里·马科维茨在其开创性论文《投资组合选择》中提出。马科维茨通过数学方法证明了资产配置对投资组合风险与收益的影响，奠定了现代投资组合理论的基础。此后，这一理论被广泛应用于金融实践，并成为投资管理的核心原则之一。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The theoretical foundation of the balanced investment strategy dates back to the 1950s, when economist Harry Markowitz introduced it in his seminal paper "Portfolio Selection." Markowitz used mathematical methods to demonstrate the impact of asset allocation on portfolio risk and return, laying the groundwork for Modern Portfolio Theory. Since then, this theory has been widely applied in financial practice and has become one of the core principles of investment management.
