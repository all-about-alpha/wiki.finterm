# Bond Discount

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：债券折价是指债券的市场价格低于其面值（票面价值）的情况。通常发生在市场利率高于债券的票面利率时，投资者要求更高的回报率，因此债券以低于面值的价格出售。  
  **English Explanation**: Bond discount refers to a situation where the market price of a bond is lower than its face value (par value). This typically occurs when market interest rates are higher than the bond's coupon rate, leading investors to demand a higher yield, thus causing the bond to sell at a price below its face value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：债券折价常见于固定收益市场，尤其是在利率上升的环境中。投资者购买折价债券时，可以通过持有至到期获得面值偿还，从而赚取差价收益。但需注意利率风险和信用风险，因为市场利率波动或发行人信用状况恶化可能影响债券价格。  
  **English Explanation**: Bond discounts are common in fixed-income markets, especially in rising interest rate environments. Investors purchasing discounted bonds can profit from the difference between the purchase price and the face value if held to maturity. However, they must be aware of interest rate risk and credit risk, as fluctuations in market rates or deterioration in the issuer's creditworthiness can impact bond prices.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，债券折价反映了市场对利率和信用风险的定价；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了潜在的高收益机会；从行业角度看，债券折价是债券市场流动性和定价效率的重要指标。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, bond discounts reflect the market's pricing of interest rate and credit risks. From an investment standpoint, they offer potential high-yield opportunities. From an industry perspective, bond discounts are a key indicator of bond market liquidity and pricing efficiency.
