# Bear Trap

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  熊市陷阱（Bear Trap）是金融市场中的一种技术分析术语，指的是市场在下跌趋势中突然出现短暂的反弹，诱使投资者误以为市场将反转上涨，从而做多或平仓空头头寸，但随后市场继续下跌，导致投资者蒙受损失。这一现象通常由市场操纵或情绪波动引发。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Bear Trap is a technical analysis term in financial markets that refers to a situation where the market, during a downtrend, experiences a brief rally, misleading investors into believing that the market will reverse and rise. This prompts them to take long positions or close short positions, only for the market to continue its decline, resulting in losses. This phenomenon is often caused by market manipulation or emotional fluctuations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  熊市陷阱常见于股票、期货和外汇市场。投资者在下跌趋势中看到价格反弹时，可能会误判为趋势反转，从而做出错误的交易决策。为避免陷入熊市陷阱，投资者应结合技术指标（如成交量、均线）和基本面分析，谨慎判断市场趋势。  
  **English Application**：  
  Bear Traps are commonly observed in stock, futures, and forex markets. When investors see a price rebound during a downtrend, they may mistakenly interpret it as a trend reversal, leading to poor trading decisions. To avoid falling into a Bear Trap, investors should use technical indicators (e.g., volume, moving averages) and fundamental analysis to carefully assess market trends.
