## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：银行挤兑（Bank Run）是指大量存款人因对银行的偿付能力失去信心，同时或短时间内集中提取存款的现象。这种现象通常发生在银行面临财务危机或市场恐慌时，可能导致银行流动性枯竭，甚至破产。  
  **English Explanation**: A bank run occurs when a large number of depositors lose confidence in a bank's ability to meet its obligations and simultaneously or within a short period withdraw their deposits. This phenomenon typically arises during financial crises or market panics and can lead to liquidity shortages or even bank insolvency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：银行挤兑通常发生在经济不稳定、金融危机或银行负面消息传播时。例如，2008年全球金融危机期间，多家银行因资产质量恶化而面临挤兑风险。监管机构通常通过存款保险制度、流动性支持和公开声明来缓解挤兑压力。  
  **English Application**: Bank runs typically occur during economic instability, financial crises, or the spread of negative news about a bank. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, many banks faced the risk of runs due to deteriorating asset quality. Regulatory bodies often mitigate such risks through deposit insurance, liquidity support, and public statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：银行挤兑对金融系统的稳定性构成重大威胁。从监管角度看，挤兑可能引发系统性风险，影响整个银行业；从投资者角度看，挤兑会导致资产贬值和市场恐慌；从行业角度看，挤兑可能加速银行倒闭，破坏经济秩序。  
  **English Significance**: Bank runs pose a significant threat to financial system stability. From a regulatory perspective, runs can trigger systemic risks affecting the entire banking sector. For investors, runs lead to asset devaluation and market panic. From an industry standpoint, runs can accelerate bank failures and disrupt economic order.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：银行挤兑的历史可以追溯到19世纪。最早的著名案例之一是1866年英国的Overend, Gurney & Company银行挤兑事件，该银行因过度投机而破产，引发大规模存款提取。20世纪30年代的大萧条期间，美国数千家银行因挤兑倒闭，促使美国政府建立联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）。  
  **English Origin**: The history of bank runs dates back to the 19th century. One of the earliest notable cases was the 1866 run on Overend, Gurney & Company in the UK, which failed due to speculative excesses. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, thousands of U.S. banks collapsed due to runs, leading to the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：银行挤兑对金融行业的影响深远。例如，2007-2008年北岩银行（Northern Rock）挤兑事件导致英国政府首次对零售银行实施国有化。挤兑不仅损害银行声誉，还可能引发连锁反应，影响整个金融体系。  
  **English Impact**: Bank runs have profound effects on the financial industry. For example, the 2007-2008 run on Northern Rock led to the first nationalization of a retail bank in the UK. Runs not only damage a bank's reputation but can also trigger chain reactions affecting the entire financial system.
