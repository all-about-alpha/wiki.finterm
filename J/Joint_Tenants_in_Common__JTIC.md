  共同共有（Joint Tenants in Common, JTIC）是一种财产共有形式，指两个或两个以上的个人或实体共同拥有一项财产，但各自拥有独立的、可分割的份额。每个共有人可以自由转让或继承其份额，且无需其他共有人的同意。这种形式常见于房地产投资、遗产分配和商业合作中。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Joint Tenants in Common (JTIC) is a form of property co-ownership where two or more individuals or entities jointly own a property, but each holds a distinct and divisible share. Each co-owner can freely transfer or inherit their share without the consent of the other co-owners. This form is commonly used in real estate investments, estate distribution, and business partnerships.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  共同共有广泛应用于房地产投资中，多个投资者可以共同购买一处房产并按照出资比例持有份额。此外，在遗产分配中，继承人可以选择以共同共有的形式继承财产，以便灵活处理各自的份额。需要注意的是，由于每个共有人可以独立处置其份额，可能存在因一方转让或抵押而导致的法律纠纷风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  JTIC is widely used in real estate investments, where multiple investors can jointly purchase a property and hold shares based on their investment proportions. In estate distribution, heirs may choose to inherit property as joint tenants in common to allow flexibility in managing their respective shares. However, since each co-owner can independently dispose of their share, there is a risk of legal disputes arising from one party’s transfer or mortgage.
