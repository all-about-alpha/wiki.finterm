* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “Just In Case”（JIC）是一种库存管理策略，强调在不确定的市场环境中，企业保持一定量的库存以应对突发需求或供应链中断。该策略的核心在于“以防万一”，确保企业在不可预见的情况下仍能正常运营。  
  **English Explanation**: "Just In Case" (JIC) is an inventory management strategy that emphasizes maintaining a certain level of stock to cope with sudden demand or supply chain disruptions in uncertain market environments. The core concept is "just in case," ensuring that businesses can operate normally even under unforeseen circumstances.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: JIC策略常用于供应链不稳定或需求波动较大的行业，如制造业、零售业和医疗行业。例如，在疫情期间，许多医疗设备制造商采用JIC策略以确保关键物资的供应。需要注意的是，JIC可能导致库存积压和资金占用，增加企业的运营成本。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: The JIC strategy is often used in industries with unstable supply chains or significant demand fluctuations, such as manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. For example, during the pandemic, many medical equipment manufacturers adopted the JIC strategy to ensure the supply of critical materials. It should be noted that JIC may lead to inventory overstock and capital occupation, increasing operational costs.
