    联合债券（Joint Bond）是由两个或两个以上的发行主体共同发行的债券。这些发行主体通常为政府、金融机构或企业，它们共同承担债券的偿还责任。联合债券的核心概念在于多个发行主体的信用叠加，从而增强债券的信用等级，降低融资成本。

    A Joint Bond is a type of bond issued by two or more entities, typically governments, financial institutions, or corporations, who share the responsibility for repayment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    联合债券常用于大型基础设施项目或跨国合作项目，例如“一带一路”倡议中的跨国铁路或港口建设项目。由于多个发行主体共同承担风险，联合债券通常被视为较低风险的融资工具。然而，投资者仍需注意发行主体的信用状况及合作关系的稳定性。  
  - **English Application**  
    Joint Bonds are often used in large-scale infrastructure projects or cross-border collaborations, such as transnational railway or port construction projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. Since multiple issuers share the risk, Joint Bonds are generally considered lower-risk financing instruments. However, investors should still pay attention to the creditworthiness of the issuers and the stability of their partnerships.
