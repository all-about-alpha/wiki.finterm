# Junior Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 次级抵押贷款（Junior Mortgage）是指在已有第一顺位抵押贷款（Senior Mortgage）的基础上，以同一房产作为抵押的后续贷款。其偿还优先级低于第一顺位抵押贷款，因此在借款人违约时，次级抵押贷款的债权人只能在第一顺位抵押贷款债权人获得清偿后才能获得剩余资产。  
  **English Explanation**: A Junior Mortgage is a loan secured by the same property that already has a primary (Senior) mortgage. It holds a lower priority in repayment compared to the Senior Mortgage, meaning that in the event of borrower default, the junior mortgage lender can only claim remaining assets after the senior mortgage lender has been fully repaid.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 次级抵押贷款常用于房屋净值贷款（Home Equity Loan）或第二按揭（Second Mortgage），帮助借款人利用房产的增值部分获取资金。然而，由于偿还优先级较低，次级抵押贷款的利率通常较高，且风险较大，尤其是在房价下跌或借款人财务状况恶化时。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Junior Mortgages are often used for home equity loans or second mortgages, allowing borrowers to access funds based on the increased value of their property. However, due to their lower repayment priority, they typically carry higher interest rates and greater risks, especially during periods of declining property values or borrower financial distress.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，次级抵押贷款的存在增加了金融系统的复杂性，需加强风险管理；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了高收益机会但伴随高风险；从行业角度看，它促进了房地产市场的流动性但可能加剧市场波动。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Junior Mortgages add complexity to the financial system and require enhanced risk management. For investors, they offer high-yield opportunities but come with significant risks. In the industry, they enhance liquidity in real estate markets but may exacerbate market volatility.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 次级抵押贷款的概念起源于20世纪初的美国房地产市场。随着房地产市场的繁荣和金融创新的发展，银行和金融机构开始提供第二按揭以满足借款人的多样化融资需求。2008年次贷危机中，次级抵押贷款的滥用成为引发全球金融危机的重要因素之一。

* **影响 / Impact**
