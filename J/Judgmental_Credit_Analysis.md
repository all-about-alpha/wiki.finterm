## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 判断性信用分析是一种基于主观判断而非纯粹定量模型的信用评估方法。它依赖于分析师的行业经验、专业知识以及对借款人财务状况、管理能力、市场环境等因素的综合考量。这种方法通常用于缺乏足够历史数据或复杂信用风险的场景。  
  **English Explanation**: Judgmental credit analysis is a credit assessment method based on subjective judgment rather than purely quantitative models.
