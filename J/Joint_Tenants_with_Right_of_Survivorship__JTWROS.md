# Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 联合共有权附带生存者权利（JTWROS）是一种财产共有形式，其中两个或更多人共同拥有财产，且当其中一位共有人去世时，其份额自动转移给其他在世的共有人。这种所有权形式强调“生存者权利”，即最后一位生存的共有人将获得全部财产所有权。  
  **English Explanation**: Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS) is a form of co-ownership where two or more individuals jointly own property, and upon the death of one co-owner, their share automatically transfers to the surviving co-owners. This ownership form emphasizes the "right of survivorship," meaning the last surviving co-owner will obtain full ownership of the property.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: JTWROS常用于夫妻或家庭成员之间的财产共有，如房产、银行账户或投资账户。其优势在于简化了继承程序，避免了遗嘱认证的繁琐过程。但需注意，一旦设立JTWROS，共有人无法通过遗嘱单独处置其份额。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: JTWROS is commonly used among spouses or family members for co-owning properties such as real estate, bank accounts, or investment accounts. Its advantage lies in simplifying inheritance procedures and avoiding the complexities of probate. However, it’s important to note that once JTWROS is established, a co-owner cannot individually dispose of their share through a will.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从法律和投资角度来看，JTWROS确保了财产的顺利转移，减少了继承纠纷的可能性。在家庭财务规划中，它是一种有效的工具，尤其适用于希望简化财产继承流程的家庭。  
  **English Significance**: From legal and investment perspectives, JTWROS ensures smooth property transfer and reduces the likelihood of inheritance disputes. In family financial planning, it serves as an effective tool, particularly for families seeking to simplify the inheritance process.
