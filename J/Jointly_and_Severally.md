# Jointly and Severally

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “连带责任”（Jointly and Severally）是一个法律术语，指多个责任人对同一债务或义务承担共同且各自独立的责任。这意味着债权人可以选择向其中任何一个或所有责任人追偿全部债务，而每个责任人都可能被要求承担全部责任，而不仅仅是其份额部分。这一概念起源于英美法系，广泛应用于合同、担保和侵权等领域。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  "Jointly and Severally" is a legal term indicating that multiple parties are collectively and individually responsible for the same obligation or debt. This means the creditor can choose to pursue any one or all of the responsible parties for the full amount, and each party may be held liable for the entire obligation, not just their proportionate share. Originating from common law, it is widely applied in contracts, guarantees, and torts.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  在金融领域，连带责任常见于贷款担保、合伙协议和债券发行中。例如，多个担保人为同一笔贷款提供担保时，银行可以选择向其中任何一个担保人追偿全部贷款金额。风险在于，即使其他担保人无力偿还，被追偿的担保人也需独自承担全部债务。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  In finance, joint and several liability is commonly seen in loan guarantees, partnership agreements, and bond issuances. For instance, when multiple guarantors back a loan, the bank can demand full repayment from any one guarantor. The risk lies in the fact that even if other guarantors cannot pay, the pursued guarantor must bear the entire debt alone.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，连带责任强化了债权人的保障机制，降低了违约风险；从投资角度看，投资者需评估连带责任带来的潜在财务压力；从行业角度看，它促进了信用体系的完善和金融交易的稳定性。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, joint and several liability strengthens creditor protection mechanisms and reduces default risks. From an investment standpoint, investors must assess potential financial pressures arising from such liability. From an industry perspective, it promotes credit system integrity and financial transaction stability.
