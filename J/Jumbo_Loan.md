# Jumbo Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    巨额贷款（Jumbo Loan）是指超过联邦住房金融局（FHFA）规定的贷款限额的高额住房抵押贷款。这类贷款通常用于购买高价房产，由于金额较大，不符合政府支持企业（如房利美和房地美）的购买标准，因此风险较高，利率也相对较高。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Jumbo Loan is a type of mortgage that exceeds the loan limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). These loans are typically used to finance high-priced properties and, due to their large size, do not qualify for purchase by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As a result, they carry higher risks and generally come with higher interest rates.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    巨额贷款主要用于购买高端住宅或豪华房产，常见于一线城市或房价较高的地区。由于贷款金额较大，借款人通常需要具备较高的信用评分和稳定的收入来源。此外，银行或贷款机构可能会要求更高的首付比例（通常为20%或以上）以降低风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    Jumbo Loans are primarily used to purchase high-end or luxury properties, often in major metropolitan areas or regions with high property values. Borrowers typically need to have excellent credit scores and stable income sources to qualify. Lenders may also require a higher down payment (usually 20% or more) to mitigate the increased risk associated with these large loans.

    巨额贷款在房地产市场中扮演着重要角色，尤其是在高端房产交易中。它为高净值人群提供了融资渠道，促进了高端房地产市场的发展。然而，由于其高风险特性，监管机构对这类贷款的审批和风险管理要求较为严格，以防止金融系统的不稳定。  
  - **English Significance**  
    Jumbo Loans play a crucial role in the real estate market, particularly in high-end property transactions. They provide financing options for high-net-worth individuals and contribute to the growth of the luxury real estate market. However, due to their high-risk nature, regulatory bodies impose strict approval and risk management requirements to prevent financial instability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    巨额贷款的概念起源于20世纪80年代的美国，当时房地产市场开始出现高价房产的需求。随着房价的上涨，传统的贷款限额无法满足高端购房者的融资需求，银行和金融机构因此推出了巨额贷款产品。这一创新为高端房地产市场注入了活力，但也带来了新的风险管理挑战。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of Jumbo Loans originated in the United States during the 1980s when the real estate market began to see demand for high-priced properties. As property values rose, traditional loan limits were insufficient to meet the financing needs of high-end buyers. Banks and financial institutions introduced Jumbo Loans to address this gap, injecting vitality into the luxury real estate market but also introducing new risk management challenges.
