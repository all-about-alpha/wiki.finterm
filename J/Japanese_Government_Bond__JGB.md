    Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) are debt instruments issued by the Japanese government to raise funds for national fiscal expenditures. JGBs are a critical component of Japan's financial market, characterized by low risk and high liquidity.

    JGBs are widely used in both domestic and international financial markets. In Japan, they are a key investment tool for financial institutions, corporations, and individual investors, as well as a primary instrument for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in implementing monetary policy. Globally, JGBs are considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of heightened global economic uncertainty. However, while JGBs are low-risk, their yields are also relatively low, requiring investors to balance returns with liquidity.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    JGB的历史可以追溯到明治维新时期（19世纪末），当时日本政府开始发行国债以支持现代化建设和军事扩张。二战后，JGB的发行规模进一步扩大，成为日本经济复苏和高速增长的重要资金来源。20世纪90年代，日本经济泡沫破裂后，JGB的发行量大幅增加，以应对经济衰退和通货紧缩。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The history of JGBs dates back to the Meiji Restoration period (late 19th century), when the Japanese government began issuing bonds to fund modernization and military expansion. After World War II, the issuance of JGBs expanded significantly, becoming a key source of funding for Japan's economic recovery and rapid growth. In the 1990s, following the collapse of Japan's economic bubble, JGB issuance surged to address economic recession and deflation.

    JGBs have had a profound impact on Japan's financial market and the global economy. In Japan, the JGB market is one of the largest in the world, and its low-yield environment has influenced global capital flows, particularly during periods of quantitative easing.
