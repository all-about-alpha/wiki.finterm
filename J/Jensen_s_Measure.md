# Jensen's Measure

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Jensen's Measure（詹森测度）是由美国经济学家迈克尔·詹森（Michael Jensen）于1968年提出的一种用于评估投资组合绩效的指标。它通过比较投资组合的实际回报率与资本资产定价模型（CAPM）预测的预期回报率之间的差异，来衡量投资经理的超额收益能力。其核心公式为：α = Rp - [Rf + β(Rm - Rf)]，其中α为超额收益，Rp为投资组合的实际回报率，Rf为无风险利率，β为投资组合的系统性风险系数，Rm为市场回报率。  
  **English Explanation**: Jensen's Measure, proposed by American economist Michael Jensen in 1968, is a metric used to evaluate the performance of an investment portfolio. It measures the excess return of a portfolio by comparing its actual return to the expected return predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The core formula is: α = Rp - [Rf + β(Rm - Rf)], where α represents the excess return, Rp is the actual return of the portfolio, Rf is the risk-free rate, β is the portfolio's systematic risk coefficient, and Rm is the market return.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：Jensen's Measure广泛应用于基金、对冲基金和资产管理领域，用于评估投资经理是否能够通过主动管理创造超额收益。其应用场景包括基金绩效排名、投资策略优化以及风险管理等。需要注意的是，该指标依赖于CAPM模型的准确性，且对市场波动较为敏感，因此在市场剧烈波动时可能产生偏差。  
  **English Explanation**: Jensen's Measure is widely used in mutual funds, hedge funds, and asset management to assess whether investment managers can generate excess returns through active management. Its applications include fund performance ranking, investment strategy optimization, and risk management. It should be noted that this metric relies on the accuracy of the CAPM model and is sensitive to market volatility, which may lead to deviations during periods of significant market fluctuations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，Jensen's Measure具有重要意义。它为投资者提供了量化评估投资经理能力的工具，有助于筛选优质基金和优化资产配置。同时，该指标也推动了资产管理行业的透明化和专业化发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Jensen's Measure holds significant importance. It provides investors with a quantitative tool to evaluate the capabilities of investment managers, aiding in selecting high-quality funds and optimizing asset allocation.
