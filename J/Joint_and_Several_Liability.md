# Joint and Several Liability

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：连带责任（Joint and Several Liability）是一种法律责任形式，指两个或两个以上的责任人对同一债务或义务承担全部责任。债权人可以选择向其中任何一个或多个责任人追偿，而每个责任人都有义务全额清偿债务。这一概念起源于罗马法，强调责任的共同性和个别性。  
  **English Explanation**: Joint and Several Liability is a legal responsibility where two or more parties are held fully liable for the same debt or obligation. The creditor can choose to pursue any one or more of the liable parties for the full amount, and each party is obligated to repay the entire debt. This concept originates from Roman law, emphasizing both collective and individual responsibility.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：连带责任常见于合同纠纷、侵权案件和合伙企业中。例如，在合伙企业中，合伙人可能对企业的债务承担连带责任；在交通事故中，多个侵权人可能对受害者的损失承担连带赔偿责任。需要注意的是，连带责任可能导致某一方承担超出其实际份额的债务风险。  
  **English Application**: Joint and Several Liability is commonly applied in contract disputes, tort cases, and partnerships. For instance, in a partnership, partners may be jointly and severally liable for the debts of the business; in car accidents, multiple tortfeasors may be jointly and severally liable for the victim's damages. It is important to note that this liability may result in one party bearing more than their fair share of the debt.
