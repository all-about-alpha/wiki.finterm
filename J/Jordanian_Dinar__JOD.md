## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    约旦第纳尔的历史可以追溯到1950年，当时约旦政府决定用第纳尔取代巴勒斯坦镑作为法定货币。这一决定与约旦从英国托管地独立后的经济自主政策密切相关。第纳尔的名称源自罗马帝国的货币单位“第纳里乌斯”（Denarius），反映了其历史渊源。约旦中央银行成立于1964年，负责发行和管理第纳尔。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The history of the Jordanian Dinar dates back to 1950 when the Jordanian government decided to replace the Palestinian Pound with the dinar as the legal tender. This decision was closely tied to Jordan's economic independence policies following its independence from British mandate rule. The name "dinar" is derived from the Roman currency unit "denarius," reflecting its historical roots. The Central Bank of Jordan was established in 1964 and is responsible for issuing and managing the dinar.

    约旦第纳尔的引入和稳定政策对约旦经济产生了深远影响。其与美元的固定汇率帮助约旦吸引了大量外国投资，并促进了国际贸易。然而，约旦经济对外部援助和侨汇的依赖也使得第纳尔的稳定性受到全球经济波动的挑战。目前，约旦第纳尔仍然是中东地区最稳定的货币之一。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The introduction and stability policies of the Jordanian Dinar have had a profound impact on Jordan's economy. Its fixed exchange rate with the US dollar has helped Jordan attract significant foreign investment and promote international trade. However, Jordan's reliance on external aid and remittances also poses challenges to the dinar's stability amid global economic fluctuations. Currently, the Jordanian Dinar remains one of the most stable currencies in the Middle East.
