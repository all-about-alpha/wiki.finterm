  **English Explanation**: The Joint Return Test is a provision in U.S. tax law used to determine whether a taxpayer is eligible for certain tax benefits or deductions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：联合申报测试通常应用于与家庭相关的税收优惠，如儿童税收抵免（Child Tax Credit）或教育相关扣除。如果纳税人未与配偶共同申报，则可能无法享受这些优惠。需要注意的是，即使夫妻双方分居或离婚，只要在纳税年度内符合条件，仍可提交联合申报表。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: The Joint Return Test is commonly applied to family-related tax benefits, such as the Child Tax Credit or education-related deductions. If a taxpayer does not file jointly with their spouse, they may be ineligible for these benefits. It’s important to note that even if spouses are separated or divorced, they can still file a joint return if they meet the criteria for the tax year.
