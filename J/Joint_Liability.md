  **中文解释**：连带责任（Joint Liability）是指两个或两个以上的责任主体对同一债务或义务共同承担全部责任的法律关系。在连带责任下，债权人有权要求任何一个或多个债务人履行全部债务，而债务人之间则需根据内部约定或法律规定分担责任。这一概念起源于罗马法，强调责任的共同性和不可分割性。  
  **English Explanation**: Joint Liability refers to a legal relationship where two or more parties are collectively responsible for the same debt or obligation. Under joint liability, the creditor has the right to demand full repayment from any one or more of the debtors, and the debtors must share the responsibility among themselves based on internal agreements or legal provisions. This concept originated in Roman law, emphasizing the joint and indivisible nature of liability.
