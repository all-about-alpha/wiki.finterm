# Jobless Recovery

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：无就业复苏（Jobless Recovery）是指在经济衰退后，经济指标如GDP、企业利润等开始回升，但就业市场却未能同步恢复的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家在20世纪末提出，核心在于经济增长与就业增长之间的脱节。  
  **English Explanation**: A jobless recovery refers to a situation where economic indicators such as GDP and corporate profits begin to improve after a recession, but the labor market fails to recover simultaneously. This concept was first introduced by economists in the late 20th century, highlighting the disconnect between economic growth and employment growth.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：无就业复苏常见于技术密集型或资本密集型行业，如制造业和金融业。在这些行业中，企业可能通过自动化或外包来降低成本，从而减少对劳动力的需求。风险在于长期失业可能导致社会不稳定和消费能力下降。  
  **English Application**: Jobless recoveries are often observed in technology-intensive or capital-intensive industries, such as manufacturing and finance. In these sectors, companies may reduce labor costs through automation or outsourcing, thereby decreasing demand for workers. The risk lies in prolonged unemployment potentially leading to social instability and reduced consumer spending.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，无就业复苏可能促使政府采取刺激就业的政策；从投资角度看，投资者需关注企业盈利与就业市场的脱节；从行业角度看，企业需平衡效率提升与员工福利。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, jobless recoveries may prompt governments to implement policies that stimulate employment. From an investment standpoint, investors need to be aware of the disconnect between corporate profits and the labor market. From an industry perspective, companies must balance efficiency gains with employee welfare.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：无就业复苏的概念最早在20世纪90年代美国经济复苏期间被提出。当时，尽管GDP和企业利润显著回升，但失业率仍居高不下。经济学家开始研究这一现象，并提出了“无就业复苏”这一术语。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of jobless recovery was first introduced during the U.S. economic recovery in the 1990s. At that time, despite significant improvements in GDP and corporate profits, unemployment rates remained high. Economists began studying this phenomenon and coined the term "jobless recovery."

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：无就业复苏对制造业和服务业的影响尤为显著。例如，2008年金融危机后，许多国家经历了无就业复苏，导致长期失业和社会不平等加剧。目前，这一问题仍是全球经济政策讨论的焦点之一。  
  **English Impact**: Jobless recoveries have had a particularly significant impact on manufacturing and service industries. For instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, many countries experienced jobless recoveries, leading to prolonged unemployment and increased social inequality. Currently, this issue remains a focal point in global economic policy discussions.
