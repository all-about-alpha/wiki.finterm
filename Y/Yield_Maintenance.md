# Yield Maintenance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：收益维持（Yield Maintenance）是一种提前还款保护机制，通常用于商业抵押贷款或债券发行中。其核心概念是借款人在提前还款时，需支付一笔额外费用，以补偿贷款人或投资者因提前还款而损失的预期收益。这笔费用通常基于剩余贷款期限的现值计算，确保贷款人或投资者在提前还款情况下仍能获得与合同约定相同的收益率。  
  **English Explanation**: Yield Maintenance is a prepayment protection mechanism commonly used in commercial mortgages or bond issuances. Its core concept is that the borrower must pay an additional fee when prepaying the loan to compensate the lender or investor for the loss of expected income due to early repayment. This fee is typically calculated based on the present value of the remaining loan term, ensuring that the lender or investor still receives the same yield as agreed in the contract even in case of prepayment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：收益维持条款常见于商业房地产贷款、资产支持证券（ABS）和抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）等金融产品中。它主要用于保护贷款人或投资者的利益，防止因借款人提前还款而导致其收益率下降。需要注意的是，收益维持费用的计算可能较为复杂，涉及利率、剩余期限等因素，因此在实际操作中需谨慎评估。  
  **English Application**: Yield Maintenance clauses are commonly found in financial products such as commercial real estate loans, asset-backed securities (ABS), and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). They are primarily used to protect the interests of lenders or investors by preventing a decline in their yield due to borrower prepayment. It is important to note that calculating Yield Maintenance fees can be complex, involving factors such as interest rates and remaining terms, so careful evaluation is required in practice.
