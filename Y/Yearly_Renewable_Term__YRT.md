# Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 年度可续保定期保险（Yearly Renewable Term, YRT）是一种人寿保险产品，其保障期限为一年，且每年到期后可以选择续保。保费通常随着年龄增长而逐年增加，因为被保险人的风险也随之增加。这种保险的核心概念是提供短期保障，适合需要灵活保险期限的人群。  
  **English Explanation**: Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) is a type of life insurance policy that provides coverage for one year and can be renewed annually upon expiration. Premiums typically increase each year as the insured ages, reflecting the increased risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: YRT常用于临时性保障需求，例如在特定项目期间或家庭经济支柱的过渡期。由于保费逐年上涨，长期使用YRT可能成本较高，因此更适合短期需求。需要注意的是，随着年龄增长，续保可能面临更高的保费或被拒保的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: YRT is often used for temporary coverage needs, such as during specific projects or transitional periods for family breadwinners. Due to the annual increase in premiums, long-term use of YRT can become costly, making it more suitable for short-term needs. It’s important to note that as the insured ages, renewal may result in higher premiums or even denial of coverage.
