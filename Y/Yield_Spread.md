* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：收益率差（Yield Spread）是指两种不同金融工具之间的收益率差异，通常用于比较债券、贷款或其他固定收益证券的回报率。核心概念在于通过比较不同风险或期限的资产收益率，评估市场风险偏好或信用风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Yield Spread refers to the difference in yields between two different financial instruments, commonly used to compare the returns of bonds, loans, or other fixed-income securities. The core concept lies in assessing market risk appetite or credit risk by comparing yields of assets with varying risks or maturities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：收益率差广泛应用于债券市场，用于衡量企业债与国债之间的信用风险差异（即信用利差），或不同期限债券之间的期限溢价。投资者通过分析收益率差来评估市场情绪、经济预期和投资机会。需注意，收益率差的扩大可能预示经济不确定性增加或信用风险上升。  
  **English Application**: Yield Spread is widely used in bond markets to measure credit risk differences between corporate bonds and government bonds (i.e., credit spreads) or term premiums between bonds of different maturities. Investors analyze yield spreads to assess market sentiment, economic expectations, and investment opportunities. Note that widening yield spreads may indicate increased economic uncertainty or rising credit risk.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：收益率差的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的债券市场分析。随着金融市场的发展，特别是1970年代后全球债券市场的扩张，收益率差逐渐成为衡量信用风险和期限溢价的核心指标。经济学家和投资者如约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在其著作中曾提及类似概念。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of yield spread can be traced back to bond market analysis in the early 20th century. With the development of financial markets, especially the expansion of global bond markets post-1970s, yield spread gradually became a core metric for measuring credit risk and term premiums. Economists and investors like John Maynard Keynes mentioned similar concepts in their works.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：收益率差的广泛应用深刻影响了金融市场的定价机制和风险管理实践。例如，2008年金融危机期间，企业债与国债的收益率差大幅扩大，成为市场恐慌的重要信号。如今，它仍是全球投资者和政策制定者关注的关键指标之一。  
  **English Impact**: The widespread use of yield spread has profoundly influenced pricing mechanisms and risk management practices in financial markets. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the widening yield spread between corporate bonds and government bonds became a significant signal of market panic.
