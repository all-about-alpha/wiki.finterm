# Yield-Based Option

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：收益型期权（Yield-Based Option）是一种金融衍生品，其价值与标的资产的收益率直接相关。这类期权的核心概念在于其定价和行权条件基于标的资产的收益率，而非传统的价格波动。收益型期权通常用于固定收益市场，如债券或贷款，以对冲利率风险或进行投机交易。  
  **English Explanation**: A Yield-Based Option is a financial derivative whose value is directly linked to the yield of the underlying asset.
