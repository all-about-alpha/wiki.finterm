# Socially Responsible Investments (SRI)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：社会责任投资（Socially Responsible Investments, SRI）是一种将环境、社会和公司治理（ESG）因素纳入投资决策的投资策略。其核心理念是通过投资促进社会和环境可持续发展，同时追求财务回报。这一概念最早由美国宗教团体在20世纪60年代提出，旨在避免投资于与道德或宗教价值观相冲突的行业，如烟草、酒精和武器制造。  
  **English Explanation**: Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) is an investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into decision-making. The core idea is to promote social and environmental sustainability while pursuing financial returns. This concept was first introduced by religious groups in the United States in the 1960s, aiming to avoid investments in industries conflicting with moral or religious values, such as tobacco, alcohol, and weapons manufacturing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：社会责任投资广泛应用于绿色能源、教育、医疗等可持续发展领域。投资者通过筛选符合ESG标准的企业或项目进行投资，同时规避高污染、高能耗或违反劳工权益的行业。需要注意的是，SRI可能面临短期回报率较低的风险，但其长期价值和社会效益显著。  
  **English Explanation**: SRI is widely applied in sustainable development fields such as green energy, education, and healthcare. Investors screen companies or projects that meet ESG criteria while avoiding industries with high pollution, energy consumption, or labor rights violations. It is important to note that SRI may face risks of lower short-term returns but offers significant long-term value and social benefits.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，社会责任投资有助于推动企业履行社会责任；从投资角度看，它能够降低长期风险并提升品牌价值；从行业角度看，SRI促进了绿色金融和可持续经济的发展。近年来，中国监管机构积极推动ESG信息披露和绿色金融体系建设，进一步提升了SRI的重要性。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, SRI helps promote corporate social responsibility; from an investment perspective, it reduces long-term risks and enhances brand value; from an industry perspective, SRI drives the development of green finance and sustainable economies. In recent years, Chinese regulators have actively promoted ESG disclosure and green financial systems, further elevating the significance of SRI.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **English Explanation**: The origin of SRI can be traced back to religious groups in the 18th century who refused to invest in industries conflicting with their doctrines. In the 1960s, the civil rights movement and anti-Vietnam War protests in the U.S. further advanced SRI. In 1971, the first socially responsible investment fund globally—the Pax World Fund—was established, marking SRI's entry into mainstream financial markets.
