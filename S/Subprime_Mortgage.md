# Subprime Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **次级抵押贷款** 是指向信用记录较差、收入不稳定或负债较高的借款人提供的住房抵押贷款。这类贷款通常利率较高，以补偿贷款机构承担的更高风险。  
  A **subprime mortgage** is a type of home loan provided to borrowers with poor credit histories, unstable incomes, or high levels of debt. These loans typically carry higher interest rates to compensate lenders for the increased risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  次级抵押贷款在中国主要用于满足信用评级较低人群的购房需求，但由于借款人还款能力较弱，贷款机构面临较高的违约风险。因此，金融机构在发放此类贷款时需严格评估借款人的还款能力，并采取相应的风险控制措施。  
  In China, subprime mortgages are primarily used to meet the housing needs of individuals with lower credit ratings. However, due to the weaker repayment capacity of borrowers, financial institutions face higher default risks. Therefore, lenders must rigorously assess borrowers' repayment abilities and implement corresponding risk control measures.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，次级抵押贷款的存在有助于扩大住房市场的覆盖面，但也可能引发系统性金融风险，因此需要加强监管。从投资角度看，次级抵押贷款证券化产品（如MBS）为投资者提供了高收益机会，但同时也伴随着高风险。从行业角度看，次级抵押贷款推动了金融创新，但也暴露了风险管理的重要性。  
  From a regulatory perspective, subprime mortgages help broaden access to the housing market but may also trigger systemic financial risks, necessitating stronger oversight. From an investment standpoint, securitized subprime mortgage products (e.g., MBS) offer high-yield opportunities but come with significant risks. From an industry perspective, subprime mortgages drive financial innovation but also highlight the importance of risk management.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context
