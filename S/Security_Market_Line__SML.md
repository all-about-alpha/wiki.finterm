# Security Market Line (SML)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：证券市场线（Security Market Line, SML）是资本资产定价模型（CAPM）的核心图形表示，用于描述资产的预期收益率与其系统性风险（β值）之间的关系。SML的纵轴代表预期收益率，横轴代表β值，其斜率表示市场风险溢价。SML的公式为：E(Ri) = Rf + βi × (E(Rm) - Rf)，其中E(Ri)是资产i的预期收益率，Rf是无风险利率，βi是资产i的系统性风险，E(Rm)是市场组合的预期收益率。  
  - **English Explanation**: The Security Market Line (SML) is a graphical representation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), illustrating the relationship between the expected return of an asset and its systematic risk (beta). The vertical axis represents expected return, while the horizontal axis represents beta. The slope of the SML indicates the market risk premium. The formula for SML is: E(Ri) = Rf + βi × (E(Rm) - Rf), where E(Ri) is the expected return of asset i, Rf is the risk-free rate, βi is the systematic risk of asset i, and E(Rm) is the expected return of the market portfolio.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用**：SML广泛应用于投资组合管理和资产定价中。投资者可以通过SML评估资产是否被高估或低估：如果资产位于SML上方，则被认为被低估（预期收益率高于理论值）；如果位于SML下方，则被认为被高估。此外，SML还可用于计算资本成本和企业估值。需要注意的是，SML假设市场完全有效，且投资者行为理性，实际应用中需结合市场条件调整。  
  - **English Application**: The SML is widely used in portfolio management and asset pricing. Investors can use the SML to determine whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued: if an asset lies above the SML, it is considered undervalued (expected return is higher than theoretical); if it lies below, it is considered overvalued. Additionally, the SML is used to calculate the cost of capital and corporate valuation. It is important to note that the SML assumes a perfectly efficient market and rational investor behavior, so adjustments may be needed in real-world applications.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：SML在金融领域具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它为评估资产风险提供了标准化工具；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者优化资产配置；从行业角度看，它是企业资本预算和估值的重要依据。SML的广泛应用推动了现代金融理论的发展，尤其是在风险管理和资产定价领域。  
  - **English Significance**: The SML holds significant importance in finance. From a regulatory perspective, it provides a standardized tool for assessing asset risk; from an investment perspective, it helps investors optimize asset allocation; and from an industry perspective, it serves as a critical basis for capital budgeting and valuation. The widespread use of the SML has advanced modern financial theory, particularly in risk management and asset pricing.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：SML的概念源于20世纪60年代，由威廉·夏普（William Sharpe）、约翰·林特纳（John Lintner）和简·莫辛（Jan Mossin）等学者在资本资产定价模型（CAPM）的研究中提出。CAPM模型旨在解释资产收益率与风险之间的关系，SML作为其图形化表达，迅速成为金融理论的核心工具之一。  
  - **English Origin**: The concept of the SML originated in the 1960s, developed by scholars such as William Sharpe, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin as part of their research on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM aimed to explain the relationship between asset returns and risk, and the SML, as its graphical representation, quickly became a cornerstone of financial theory.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**：SML的提出对金融行业产生了深远影响。它不仅为资产定价提供了理论框架，还推动了投资组合管理、风险管理和企业估值等领域的发展。如今，SML已成为全球金融市场的核心工具之一，广泛应用于学术研究和实践操作中。  
  - **English Impact**: The introduction of the SML has had a profound impact on the financial industry. It not only provided a theoretical framework for asset pricing but also advanced fields such as portfolio management, risk management, and corporate valuation. Today, the SML is a core tool in global financial markets, widely used in both academic research and practical applications.
