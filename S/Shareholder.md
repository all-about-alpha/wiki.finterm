  **English Explanation**: A shareholder is an individual or institution that owns a portion of a company by purchasing its shares. As part-owners of the company, shareholders are entitled to a share of the company's profits (e.g., dividends) and have the right to participate in major corporate decisions (e.g., voting at shareholder meetings). Shareholders' liability is typically limited to the amount of their investment.

  **English Application**: Shareholders play a critical role in corporate governance by exercising voting rights at shareholder meetings to influence strategic direction, management appointments, and profit distribution policies. Common shareholders and preferred shareholders have different rights; preferred shareholders often have priority in dividend payments but may have limited voting rights. Shareholders must monitor the company's performance, market risks, and regulatory changes to protect their interests.
