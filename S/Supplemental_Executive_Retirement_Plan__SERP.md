# Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    补充高管退休计划（SERP）是一种非合格递延补偿计划，旨在为高管提供额外的退休福利，以补充其现有的合格退休计划（如401(k)）。SERP通常由公司自愿设立，用于吸引和留住高层管理人员。其核心概念包括递延薪酬、税收优惠和定制化福利设计。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan designed to provide additional retirement benefits to executives, supplementing their existing qualified retirement plans (e.g., 401(k)). SERPs are typically established voluntarily by companies to attract and retain top-tier executives. Key concepts include deferred compensation, tax advantages, and customized benefit design.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    SERP通常应用于大型企业或高利润行业，如金融、科技和制造业。公司通过SERP为高管提供额外的退休保障，以弥补其在合格退休计划中的福利限制。需要注意的是，SERP的资金通常不受ERISA（《雇员退休收入保障法》）保护，存在公司破产时无法兑现的风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    SERPs are commonly used in large corporations or high-profit industries such as finance, technology, and manufacturing. Companies use SERPs to provide additional retirement security for executives, addressing limitations in qualified retirement plans. It is important to note that SERP funds are typically not protected under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act), posing risks of non-payment in the event of company bankruptcy.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，SERP不受ERISA约束，但需遵守《国内税收法》第409A条。从投资和行业角度看，SERP是企业薪酬战略的重要组成部分，有助于提升高管忠诚度和竞争力。然而，其非合格性质也带来了潜在的财务和税务风险。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, SERPs are not subject to ERISA but must comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. From an investment and industry standpoint, SERPs are a critical component of corporate compensation strategies, enhancing executive loyalty and competitiveness. However, their non-qualified nature also introduces potential financial and tax risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    SERP的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代，当时美国企业开始寻求在合格退休计划之外为高管提供额外福利。随着《国内税收法》的修订和市场竞争的加剧，SERP逐渐成为企业薪酬体系中的重要工具。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The origin of SERPs dates back to the 1970s when U.S. corporations began seeking ways to provide additional benefits to executives beyond qualified retirement plans. With amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and increasing market competition, SERPs gradually became a key tool in corporate compensation systems.

* **影响 / Impact**

    SERP的引入显著提升了高管的退休保障水平，同时也推动了企业薪酬结构的多样化。然而，其非合格性质和高成本也引发了对企业财务健康和公平性的讨论。目前，SERP在全球范围内被广泛应用，尤其是在美国、欧洲和亚洲的跨国企业中。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The introduction of SERPs significantly enhanced retirement security for executives and diversified corporate compensation structures. However, their non-qualified nature and high costs have sparked debates about corporate financial health and fairness. Today, SERPs are widely used globally, particularly in multinational corporations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
