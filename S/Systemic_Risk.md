# Systemic Risk

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：系统性风险（Systemic Risk）是指由于整个金融系统或市场中的某一环节出现问题，导致整个系统或市场崩溃的风险。这种风险通常由金融机构之间的相互关联性、市场流动性不足或宏观经济波动等因素引发。系统性风险的核心在于其广泛性和传染性，可能对经济和社会造成深远影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Systemic Risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or market due to a failure in one part of the system. This risk is typically triggered by interconnectedness among financial institutions, insufficient market liquidity, or macroeconomic fluctuations. The core of systemic risk lies in its widespread and contagious nature, which can have profound impacts on the economy and society.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：系统性风险在金融监管、投资决策和风险管理中具有重要意义。例如，2008年全球金融危机就是典型的系统性风险事件，由于次贷危机引发连锁反应，导致全球金融市场动荡。金融机构需通过压力测试、资本充足率管理等手段来防范系统性风险。  
  **English Application**: Systemic risk is crucial in financial regulation, investment decision-making, and risk management. For instance, the 2008 global financial crisis was a classic example of systemic risk, where the subprime mortgage crisis triggered a chain reaction, leading to global financial market turmoil. Financial institutions need to mitigate systemic risk through stress testing, capital adequacy management, and other measures.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，系统性风险是金融稳定的主要威胁，各国监管机构通过宏观审慎政策（如巴塞尔协议）来防范此类风险。从投资角度看，系统性风险可能导致资产价格大幅波动，投资者需关注市场整体风险。从行业角度看，金融机构需加强内部风险管理，避免成为系统性风险的源头。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, systemic risk is a major threat to financial stability, and regulators worldwide use macroprudential policies (such as the Basel Accords) to mitigate it. From an investment perspective, systemic risk can lead to significant asset price volatility, requiring investors to monitor overall market risks. From an industry perspective, financial institutions must enhance internal risk management to avoid becoming a source of systemic risk.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：系统性风险的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的经济大萧条时期。1929年的股市崩盘和随后的银行倒闭潮揭示了金融系统内部的脆弱性。20世纪80年代后，随着金融全球化加速，系统性风险的研究逐渐成为金融学的核心议题。2008年金融危机后，系统性风险的理论和实践得到了进一步深化。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of systemic risk dates back to the Great Depression of the early 20th century. The stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent wave of bank failures revealed the fragility within the financial system. After the 1980s, with the acceleration of financial globalization, the study of systemic risk gradually became a core topic in finance. The 2008 financial crisis further deepened the theory and practice of systemic risk.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：系统性风险对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机后，各国加强了对金融机构的监管，推出了《多德-弗兰克法案》等改革措施。当前，系统性风险仍是金融监管的重点，尤其是在金融科技快速发展的背景下，新型风险（如加密货币市场波动）可能引发系统性危机。  
  **English Impact**: Systemic risk has had a profound impact on the global financial system. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, countries strengthened regulation of financial institutions and introduced reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act. Currently, systemic risk remains a key focus of financial regulation, especially in the context of rapid fintech development, where new risks (such as cryptocurrency market volatility) could trigger systemic crises.
