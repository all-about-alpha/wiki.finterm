## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  保证（Surety）是指由第三方（保证人）为债务人（被保证人）向债权人提供的一种担保形式，承诺在债务人未能履行其债务时，由保证人代为履行或承担责任。保证的核心概念包括三方关系：债权人、债务人和保证人。保证通常用于合同履行、贷款偿还等场景，以确保债权人的利益得到保障。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Surety refers to a form of guarantee provided by a third party (the surety) to a creditor on behalf of a debtor (the principal), promising to fulfill the obligation or assume responsibility if the debtor fails to do so. The core concept of surety involves a tripartite relationship: the creditor, the debtor, and the surety. Surety is commonly used in scenarios such as contract performance and loan repayment to ensure the creditor's interests are protected.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  保证广泛应用于建筑工程、贷款担保、合同履行等领域。例如，在建筑工程中，承包商可能需要提供履约保证，以确保项目按时完成。在贷款场景中，借款人可能需要第三方提供保证，以增强贷款机构对其还款能力的信心。需要注意的是，保证人需承担连带责任，因此在提供保证前应充分评估债务人的履约能力和风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Surety is widely used in construction projects, loan guarantees, and contract performance. For example, in construction projects, contractors may need to provide performance bonds to ensure timely project completion. In loan scenarios, borrowers may require a third-party surety to enhance the lender's confidence in their repayment ability. It is important to note that the surety assumes joint liability, so a thorough assessment of the debtor's ability to perform and associated risks is essential before providing a guarantee.
