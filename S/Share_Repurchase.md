# Share Repurchase

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：股票回购（Share Repurchase）是指上市公司利用自有资金或债务融资，从公开市场或特定股东手中购回本公司已发行股票的行为。这一行为通常由公司董事会批准，旨在减少流通股数量，提升每股收益（EPS）和股东价值。核心概念包括“回购方式”（如公开市场回购、要约回购）和“回购目的”（如资本结构调整、股权激励等）。  
  **English Explanation**: A share repurchase, also known as a stock buyback, refers to a company's action of buying back its own shares from the open market or specific shareholders using its own funds or debt financing. This action is typically approved by the board of directors and aims to reduce the number of outstanding shares, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS) and shareholder value. Key concepts include "repurchase methods" (e.g., open market repurchases, tender offers) and "repurchase purposes" (e.g., capital structure adjustment, equity incentives).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：股票回购常用于以下场景：1）公司认为股价被低估时，通过回购提振市场信心；2）优化资本结构，降低股本成本；3）用于员工股权激励计划。需要注意的是，回购可能被视为公司缺乏投资机会的信号，且过度依赖债务融资进行回购可能增加财务风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Share repurchases are commonly used in the following scenarios: 1) when a company believes its stock is undervalued, repurchases can boost market confidence; 2) to optimize the capital structure and reduce the cost of equity; 3) for employee stock incentive plans. It is important to note that repurchases may be seen as a signal that the company lacks investment opportunities, and excessive reliance on debt financing for repurchases may increase financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，股票回购需遵守严格的披露要求，以确保市场公平性。从投资角度看，回购通常被视为公司对自身前景看好的信号，可能吸引投资者关注。从行业角度看，回购行为反映了公司管理层对资本配置的决策能力，是衡量公司治理水平的重要指标。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, share repurchases are subject to strict disclosure requirements to ensure market fairness. From an investment perspective, repurchases are often seen as a signal of the company's confidence in its future prospects, potentially attracting investor attention. From an industry perspective, repurchase activities reflect management's decision-making ability in capital allocation and serve as an important indicator of corporate governance quality.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：股票回购的起源可追溯至20世纪50年代的美国。当时，一些公司开始尝试通过回购股票来调整资本结构。1982年，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）颁布了Rule 10b-18，为股票回购提供了法律框架，使其逐渐成为全球资本市场的常见操作。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of share repurchases can be traced back to the 1950s in the United States, when some companies began experimenting with repurchasing shares to adjust their capital structures.
