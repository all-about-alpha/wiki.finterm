  **中文解释**：Smurf（拆分交易）是一种洗钱手段，指将大额资金拆分为多笔小额交易，以规避金融机构的反洗钱监控。这种行为通常由多个参与者（称为“Smurfs”）共同完成，目的是使每笔交易金额低于监管报告门槛，从而逃避检测。  
  **English Explanation**: Smurfing is a money laundering technique where large sums of money are broken into multiple smaller transactions to evade anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring by financial institutions.

  **English Application**: Smurfing is often used in illegal fund transfers, tax evasion, or financing criminal activities. For instance, criminals may use multiple bank accounts or payment platforms to conduct small transactions to obscure the source and destination of funds. It is important to note that this practice is illegal and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，打击Smurfing是反洗钱工作的重要环节；从投资和行业角度看，防范此类行为有助于维护金融市场的公平性和透明度。金融机构需加强监控和技术手段，以识别和阻止此类活动。
