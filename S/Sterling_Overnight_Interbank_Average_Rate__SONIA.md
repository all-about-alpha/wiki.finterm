## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    英镑隔夜银行间平均利率（SONIA）是英国金融市场中用于衡量银行间无担保隔夜拆借利率的基准利率。它由英格兰银行（Bank of England）于1997年推出，旨在反映银行间市场在隔夜期限内的实际借贷成本。SONIA基于实际交易数据计算，剔除了异常值，具有较高的透明度和可靠性。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (SONIA) is a benchmark interest rate used in the UK financial markets to measure the average rate at which banks lend to each other on an unsecured overnight basis. Introduced by the Bank of England in 1997, SONIA reflects the actual cost of borrowing in the interbank market for overnight transactions. It is calculated based on actual transaction data, excluding outliers, and is known for its transparency and reliability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    SONIA广泛应用于英国金融市场的衍生品定价、贷款协议和利率互换等场景。它是英镑无风险利率（RFR）的代表，被用作替代伦敦银行间同业拆借利率（LIBOR）的关键基准。金融机构使用SONIA来管理利率风险和定价金融产品。需要注意的是，SONIA仅反映隔夜利率，因此对于长期利率的参考价值有限。  
  - **English Application**  
    SONIA is widely used in the UK financial markets for pricing derivatives, loan agreements, and interest rate swaps. As the representative of the Sterling Risk-Free Rate (RFR), it serves as a key benchmark to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Financial institutions use SONIA to manage interest rate risk and price financial products. It is important to note that SONIA only reflects overnight rates, so its relevance for long-term rates is limited.
