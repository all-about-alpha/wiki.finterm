# Subordinated Debt

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：次级债务（Subordinated Debt）是一种在偿还顺序上低于优先债务的债务工具。当债务人破产或清算时，次级债务的债权人只有在优先债务的债权人得到全额偿还后，才能获得偿还。这种债务通常具有较高的利率，以补偿其较高的风险。次级债务常见于银行和金融机构的资本结构中，用于满足监管资本要求。  
  **English Explanation**: Subordinated debt is a type of debt instrument that ranks below senior debt in terms of repayment priority. In the event of bankruptcy or liquidation, subordinated debt holders are only repaid after senior debt holders have been fully satisfied. This type of debt typically carries a higher interest rate to compensate for its higher risk. Subordinated debt is commonly used in the capital structures of banks and financial institutions to meet regulatory capital requirements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：次级债务广泛应用于金融机构的资本补充，特别是在满足巴塞尔协议等监管要求时。由于其偿还顺序较低，次级债务通常被视为一种高风险投资工具，适合风险承受能力较高的投资者。投资者在购买次级债务时需注意其信用风险和流动性风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Subordinated debt is widely used by financial institutions for capital supplementation, especially in meeting regulatory requirements such as the Basel Accords. Due to its lower repayment priority, subordinated debt is generally considered a high-risk investment instrument, suitable for investors with a higher risk tolerance. Investors should be aware of the credit risk and liquidity risk associated with subordinated debt.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，次级债务是金融机构资本结构的重要组成部分，有助于提高其资本充足率。从投资角度看，次级债务为投资者提供了较高的收益潜力，但同时也伴随着较高的风险。从行业角度看，次级债务的存在有助于金融体系的稳定性和抗风险能力。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, subordinated debt is a crucial component of financial institutions' capital structures, helping to improve their capital adequacy ratios. From an investment perspective, subordinated debt offers higher potential returns but also comes with higher risks. From an industry perspective, the existence of subordinated debt contributes to the stability and risk resilience of the financial system.
