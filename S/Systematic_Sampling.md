# Systematic Sampling

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  系统抽样（Systematic Sampling）是一种统计抽样方法，通过固定的间隔从总体中选取样本。其核心概念是首先确定一个起始点，然后按照固定的“抽样间隔”（k）依次选取样本。这种方法由统计学家在20世纪初提出，广泛应用于市场调研、质量控制等领域。  
  Systematic Sampling is a statistical sampling method that selects samples from a population at fixed intervals. The core concept involves determining a starting point and then selecting samples at a fixed "sampling interval" (k). This method was introduced by statisticians in the early 20th century and is widely used in market research, quality control, and other fields.

* **应用 / Application**  
  系统抽样常用于大规模调查或数据收集，如人口普查、产品质量检测等。其优势在于操作简单且成本较低，但需注意总体是否具有周期性特征，否则可能导致样本偏差。  
  Systematic Sampling is often used in large-scale surveys or data collection, such as population censuses or product quality inspections. Its advantages include simplicity and cost-effectiveness, but care must be taken to ensure the population does not exhibit periodic patterns, which could lead to sample bias.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和投资角度看，系统抽样提供了一种高效的数据收集方式，有助于快速获取代表性样本。在工业领域，它被广泛用于质量管理和流程优化。  
  From regulatory and investment perspectives, Systematic Sampling offers an efficient data collection method, enabling the rapid acquisition of representative samples. In industrial settings, it is widely used for quality management and process optimization.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  系统抽样的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的统计学发展时期。随着工业革命和大规模生产的兴起，统计学家开始探索更高效的抽样方法以应对日益增长的数据需求。系统抽样因其简单性和实用性迅速被采纳并推广。  
  The concept of Systematic Sampling dates back to the early 20th century during the development of statistics. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution and mass production, statisticians began exploring more efficient sampling methods to meet growing data demands. Systematic Sampling was quickly adopted and promoted due to its simplicity and practicality.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  系统抽样对统计学和应用科学产生了深远影响，特别是在市场调研、社会科学研究和工业生产中。如今，它已成为一种标准化的数据收集工具，广泛应用于全球各个领域。  
  Systematic Sampling has had a profound impact on statistics and applied sciences, particularly in market research, social science studies, and industrial production. Today, it has become a standardized data collection tool widely used across various fields globally.
