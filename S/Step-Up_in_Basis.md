# Step-Up in Basis

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Step-Up in Basis（基础提升）是指在资产继承或赠与过程中，资产的原成本基础（即购买时的成本）被调整为继承或赠与时的市场价值。这一调整通常发生在资产所有者去世后，继承人获得资产时，其成本基础被“提升”至当时的市场价值，从而减少未来出售资产时的资本利得税。  
  **English Explanation**: Step-Up in Basis refers to the adjustment of the original cost basis of an asset to its market value at the time of inheritance or gifting. This adjustment typically occurs when the owner of the asset passes away, and the inheritor receives the asset with its cost basis "stepped up" to the current market value, thereby reducing potential capital gains taxes upon future sale.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Step-Up in Basis主要应用于遗产继承和赠与税规划中。例如，当某人继承了一套房产时，该房产的成本基础将从原购买价格提升至继承时的市场价值。如果继承人随后出售该房产，资本利得税将基于新的、更高的成本基础计算，从而减少应纳税额。需要注意的是，这一规则在不同国家和地区可能有所不同，需结合当地税法进行规划。  
  **English Application**: Step-Up in Basis is primarily used in estate planning and gift tax strategies. For instance, when someone inherits a property, the cost basis of that property is adjusted from its original purchase price to its market value at the time of inheritance. If the inheritor later sells the property, capital gains tax will be calculated based on this new, higher cost basis, thereby reducing taxable income. It’s important to note that this rule may vary across jurisdictions and should be planned according to local tax laws.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：Step-Up in Basis在遗产规划和税务优化中具有重要意义。它帮助继承人减少资本利得税的负担，同时鼓励资产的代际传递。从监管角度看，这一规则有助于简化遗产税的征收流程；从投资角度看，它为长期持有资产的投资者提供了税务优惠；从行业角度看，它促进了财富管理和税务咨询业务的发展。  
  **English Significance**: Step-Up in Basis plays a crucial role in estate planning and tax optimization. It helps inheritors reduce their capital gains tax burden while encouraging intergenerational wealth transfer. From a regulatory perspective, this rule simplifies estate tax collection processes; from an investment standpoint, it provides tax benefits for long-term asset holders; and from an industry perspective, it fosters growth in wealth management and tax advisory services.
