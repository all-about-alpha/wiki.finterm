# Structural Unemployment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：结构性失业是指由于经济结构变化（如技术进步、产业升级或全球化）导致的劳动力供需不匹配，使得部分劳动者因技能或地理位置等原因无法找到合适的工作。这种失业通常与长期经济转型相关，而非短期经济波动。  
  **English Explanation**: Structural unemployment refers to a mismatch between the supply of labor and the demand for labor caused by economic structural changes, such as technological advancements, industrial upgrades, or globalization. This type of unemployment occurs when workers are unable to find suitable jobs due to skill mismatches or geographic disparities, and it is typically associated with long-term economic transformations rather than short-term economic fluctuations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：结构性失业常见于传统制造业向高科技产业转型的过程中，例如工人因缺乏数字化技能而失业。此外，全球化导致的产业转移也可能引发结构性失业，如制造业岗位向低成本国家迁移。风险在于，若政府或企业未能及时提供再培训或就业支持，失业问题可能长期化。  
  **English Application**: Structural unemployment often occurs during the transition from traditional manufacturing to high-tech industries, such as workers losing jobs due to a lack of digital skills. Additionally, globalization-induced industrial relocations, such as manufacturing jobs moving to low-cost countries, can also trigger structural unemployment. The risk lies in the potential for long-term unemployment if governments or businesses fail to provide timely retraining or employment support.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，结构性失业是政策制定者需要重点关注的问题，因为它可能引发社会不稳定和经济效率下降。从投资角度看，结构性失业可能影响特定行业或地区的经济表现，进而影响相关资产的价值。从行业角度看，企业需要适应经济结构变化，通过创新和员工培训来减少失业风险。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, structural unemployment is a critical issue for policymakers as it can lead to social instability and reduced economic efficiency. From an investment perspective, structural unemployment may impact the economic performance of specific industries or regions, thereby affecting the value of related assets. From an industry perspective, businesses must adapt to economic structural changes by innovating and providing employee training to mitigate unemployment risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：结构性失业的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的经济学家，如约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter），他提出的“创造性破坏”理论解释了技术进步如何淘汰旧产业并催生新产业。20世纪70年代，随着全球化和信息技术革命的兴起，结构性失业问题逐渐凸显。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of structural unemployment can be traced back to early 20th-century economists such as Joseph Schumpeter, whose theory of "creative destruction" explained how technological advancements eliminate old industries and create new ones. In the 1970s, with the rise of globalization and the information technology revolution, structural unemployment became increasingly prominent.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：结构性失业对全球劳动力市场产生了深远影响。例如，美国制造业的衰退导致大量工人失业，而中国在产业升级过程中也面临类似挑战。当前，随着人工智能和自动化技术的普及，结构性失业问题进一步加剧，成为全球各国政府和企业亟需解决的难题。  
  **English Impact**: Structural unemployment has had a profound impact on global labor markets. For example, the decline of manufacturing in the United States led to significant job losses, while China faces similar challenges during its industrial upgrading. Currently, with the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence and automation technologies, structural unemployment has further intensified, becoming a critical issue for governments and businesses worldwide.
