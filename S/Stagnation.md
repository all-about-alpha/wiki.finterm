# Stagnation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **停滞** 是指经济、市场或某个行业在一段时间内缺乏增长或发展，通常表现为低增长率、高失业率或生产力下降。这一概念最早由经济学家在分析经济周期时提出，核心在于经济活动长期处于低迷状态。  
  **Stagnation** refers to a period of little or no growth in the economy, market, or a specific industry, often characterized by low growth rates, high unemployment, or declining productivity. This concept was initially introduced by economists analyzing economic cycles, with its core being prolonged sluggishness in economic activity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，停滞现象常见于传统制造业或资源型行业，尤其是在经济转型期。例如，钢铁、煤炭等行业曾因产能过剩而陷入停滞。风险在于，长期停滞可能导致企业倒闭、失业率上升和社会不稳定。  
  In China, stagnation is often observed in traditional manufacturing or resource-based industries, especially during economic transitions. For instance, industries like steel and coal have experienced stagnation due to overcapacity. The risk lies in prolonged stagnation potentially leading to business closures, rising unemployment, and social instability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，识别和应对停滞是确保经济平稳运行的关键；从投资角度看，停滞行业往往意味着高风险低回报；从产业角度看，停滞可能倒逼企业创新或转型。  
  From a regulatory perspective, identifying and addressing stagnation is crucial for ensuring stable economic operations; from an investment standpoint, stagnant industries often imply high risk and low returns; from an industrial perspective, stagnation may force companies to innovate or transform.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  停滞的概念最早可追溯到20世纪30年代的“大萧条”时期，当时全球经济陷入长期低迷。经济学家如阿尔文·汉森（Alvin Hansen）提出了“长期停滞理论”，认为人口增长放缓和投资机会减少是主要原因。  
  The concept of stagnation dates back to the Great Depression of the 1930s when the global economy experienced prolonged sluggishness. Economists like Alvin Hansen proposed the "secular stagnation theory," attributing it to slowing population growth and diminishing investment opportunities.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，2008年全球金融危机后，部分行业因外部需求萎缩而陷入停滞。如今，随着经济结构调整和科技创新，许多传统行业正逐步摆脱停滞状态。在全球范围内，日本“失落的十年”是经济停滞的典型案例。  
  In China, after the 2008 global financial crisis, some industries stagnated due to shrinking external demand. Today, with economic restructuring and technological innovation, many traditional industries are gradually emerging from stagnation. Globally, Japan's "Lost Decade" is a classic example of economic stagnation.
