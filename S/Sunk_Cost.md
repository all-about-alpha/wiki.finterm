# Sunk Cost

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **沉没成本** 是指已经发生且无法收回的成本，无论未来的决策如何，这些成本都不会改变。这一概念由经济学家提出，强调在决策时应忽略沉没成本，而只考虑未来的成本和收益。  
  **Sunk Cost** refers to costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, regardless of future decisions. This concept, introduced by economists, emphasizes that sunk costs should be ignored in decision-making, focusing only on future costs and benefits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在商业和投资决策中，沉没成本常被错误地纳入考虑范围，导致“沉没成本谬误”。例如，企业可能因为已经投入大量资金而继续亏损项目，而不是及时止损。正确应用沉没成本概念有助于避免资源浪费和优化决策。  
  In business and investment decisions, sunk costs are often mistakenly factored in, leading to the "sunk cost fallacy." For example, a company might continue a loss-making project due to significant prior investments rather than cutting losses. Proper application of the sunk cost concept helps avoid resource waste and optimize decision-making.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和投资角度看，理解沉没成本有助于提高决策效率，避免因情感或惯性导致的错误选择。在行业中，这一概念被广泛应用于项目管理、投资分析和战略规划。  
  From regulatory and investment perspectives, understanding sunk costs improves decision-making efficiency and avoids errors caused by emotions or inertia. In industries, this concept is widely applied in project management, investment analysis, and strategic planning.

  The concept of sunk costs dates back to early 20th-century economic research, particularly in fields related to opportunity cost and decision theory. Economists such as John Maynard Keynes and Herbert Simon explored this concept in their works.
