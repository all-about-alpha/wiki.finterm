# Say's Law of Markets

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：萨伊定律（Say's Law of Markets）是由法国经济学家让-巴蒂斯特·萨伊（Jean-Baptiste Say）在19世纪初提出的经济学理论。其核心观点是“供给创造需求”（Supply creates its own demand），即商品的生产本身会为其创造市场需求，经济中的总供给和总需求总是趋于平衡。  
  - **English Explanation**: Say's Law of Markets, proposed by French economist Jean-Baptiste Say in the early 19th century, is an economic theory that posits "supply creates its own demand." This means that the production of goods inherently generates the demand for them, ensuring that aggregate supply and demand in an economy tend to balance each other.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用**：萨伊定律在古典经济学中被广泛用于解释市场经济的自我调节机制。它认为经济衰退或过剩是由于供给不足或资源配置不当，而非需求不足。然而，这一理论在现代经济学中受到质疑，尤其是在凯恩斯主义经济学中，认为需求不足可能导致长期失业和经济停滞。  
  - **English Application**: Say's Law was widely used in classical economics to explain the self-regulating mechanisms of a market economy. It suggests that economic recessions or surpluses are due to insufficient supply or misallocation of resources, rather than a lack of demand. However, this theory has been challenged in modern economics, particularly by Keynesian economics, which argues that insufficient demand can lead to prolonged unemployment and economic stagnation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：萨伊定律在经济学史上具有重要意义，它为自由市场经济提供了理论基础，强调市场自我调节的能力。然而，随着经济危机的出现，尤其是20世纪30年代的大萧条，萨伊定律的局限性逐渐显现，促使经济学家重新思考供需关系。  
  - **English Significance**: Say's Law holds significant importance in the history of economics, providing a theoretical foundation for free-market economies by emphasizing the self-regulating capacity of markets. However, its limitations became apparent with the advent of economic crises, particularly the Great Depression of the 1930s, prompting economists to reconsider the relationship between supply and demand.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：萨伊定律最早出现在让-巴蒂斯特·萨伊1803年出版的《政治经济学概论》（Traité d'économie politique）中。萨伊受到亚当·斯密（Adam Smith）的《国富论》启发，进一步发展了古典经济学的思想。  
  - **English Origin**: Say's Law was first articulated in Jean-Baptiste Say's 1803 work, *Traité d'économie politique* (A Treatise on Political Economy). Inspired by Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations*, Say expanded on classical economic thought.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**：萨伊定律在19世纪和20世纪初主导了经济学思想，成为自由放任经济政策的理论基础。然而，20世纪30年代的大萧条彻底动摇了这一理论的地位，凯恩斯主义经济学取而代之，强调政府干预以刺激需求。  
  - **English Impact**: Say's Law dominated economic thought in the 19th and early 20th centuries, forming the theoretical basis for laissez-faire economic policies. However, the Great Depression of the 1930s significantly undermined its credibility, leading to the rise of Keynesian economics, which emphasized government intervention to stimulate demand.
