## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：储蓄和贷款危机的根源可追溯至20世纪70年代末，当时美国经济面临高通胀和利率上升的压力。1980年，美国国会通过《存款机构放松管制与货币控制法案》，放松了对储蓄和贷款机构的监管，允许其从事高风险投资。然而，利率波动和经济衰退导致大量不良贷款，最终引发危机。  
  **English Explanation**: The origins of the S&L Crisis can be traced back to the late 1970s, when the U.S. economy faced high inflation and rising interest rates. In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, which relaxed regulations on S&L institutions and allowed them to engage in high-risk investments. However, interest rate volatility and economic recession led to a surge in non-performing loans, ultimately triggering the crisis.
