# Spreads

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  价差（Spreads）是指金融市场上两种相关资产价格之间的差异。常见的价差类型包括买卖价差（Bid-Ask Spread）、债券价差（Bond Spread）和信用价差（Credit Spread）。买卖价差是指买入价和卖出价之间的差额，反映了市场的流动性和交易成本；债券价差通常指不同信用等级债券之间的收益率差异；信用价差则是指企业债券与无风险债券（如国债）之间的收益率差异，用于衡量信用风险。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Spreads refer to the difference between the prices of two related financial assets. Common types of spreads include the bid-ask spread, bond spread, and credit spread. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the buying and selling prices, reflecting market liquidity and transaction costs. Bond spreads typically refer to the yield difference between bonds of different credit ratings. Credit spreads measure the yield difference between corporate bonds and risk-free bonds (such as government bonds), serving as an indicator of credit risk.

* **应用 / Application**
