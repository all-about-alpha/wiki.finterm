# Securitization

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：证券化（Securitization）是指将缺乏流动性但能够产生可预测现金流的资产，通过结构性重组，转化为可以在金融市场上自由买卖的证券的过程。这一过程通常由发起人（如银行或金融机构）将资产打包，并通过特殊目的载体（SPV）发行证券，投资者通过购买这些证券获得资产未来现金流的收益权。  
  **English Explanation**: Securitization refers to the process of transforming illiquid assets that generate predictable cash flows into tradable securities in the financial markets. This process typically involves an originator (such as a bank or financial institution) pooling assets and issuing securities through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Investors purchase these securities to gain rights to the future cash flows generated by the underlying assets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：证券化广泛应用于住房抵押贷款、汽车贷款、信用卡应收账款等领域。例如，住房抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）和资产支持证券（ABS）是证券化的典型产品。在中国，证券化市场近年来快速发展，但仍需注意信用风险、流动性风险以及市场波动带来的潜在风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Securitization is widely applied in areas such as residential mortgages, auto loans, and credit card receivables. For example, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) are typical products of securitization. In China, the securitization market has grown rapidly in recent years, but attention must be paid to potential risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk, and market volatility.
