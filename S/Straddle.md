# Straddle

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    跨式期权（Straddle）是一种期权交易策略，投资者同时买入或卖出同一标的资产、相同到期日、相同行权价的看涨期权和看跌期权。这种策略通常用于预期标的资产价格将出现大幅波动，但不确定波动方向时。跨式期权的核心概念是通过同时持有看涨和看跌期权，无论市场上涨还是下跌，投资者都能从中获利。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A straddle is an options trading strategy where an investor simultaneously buys or sells a call option and a put option on the same underlying asset, with the same expiration date and strike price. This strategy is typically used when the investor expects significant price volatility in the underlying asset but is uncertain about the direction of the movement. The core concept of a straddle is to profit from significant price movements in either direction by holding both call and put options.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    跨式期权常用于市场波动性较大的时期，例如公司财报发布、重大经济数据公布或政治事件前后。投资者通过买入跨式期权，可以在市场大幅波动时获利，但需注意高额的权利金成本。卖出跨式期权则适用于预期市场波动较小的情景，但需承担无限风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    Straddles are commonly used during periods of high market volatility, such as around earnings announcements, major economic data releases, or political events. By purchasing a straddle, investors can profit from significant market movements, but they must be aware of the high premium costs. Selling a straddle is suitable for scenarios where low market volatility is expected, but it carries unlimited risk.
