# Statutory Reserves

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **法定准备金**是指根据法律法规要求，金融机构必须持有的最低资本储备，以确保其具备足够的偿付能力，应对潜在的金融风险。这一概念最早由监管机构提出，旨在维护金融系统的稳定性。  
  **Statutory Reserves** refer to the minimum capital reserves that financial institutions are legally required to hold, ensuring they have sufficient solvency to address potential financial risks. This concept was introduced by regulatory authorities to maintain the stability of the financial system.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，法定准备金主要应用于银行、保险公司等金融机构。例如，中国人民银行通过调整存款准备金率来调控货币供应量，从而影响经济。需要注意的是，过高的准备金率可能限制金融机构的放贷能力，而过低则可能增加金融风险。  
  In China, statutory reserves are primarily applied to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. For instance, the People's Bank of China adjusts the reserve requirement ratio to regulate money supply and influence the economy. It is important to note that excessively high reserve ratios may limit lending capacity, while excessively low ratios may increase financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，法定准备金是防范系统性金融风险的重要工具；从投资角度看，它影响金融机构的盈利能力和市场信心；从行业角度看，它是衡量金融机构稳健性的关键指标。  
  From a regulatory perspective, statutory reserves are a crucial tool for preventing systemic financial risks; from an investment perspective, they impact the profitability and market confidence of financial institutions; from an industry perspective, they are a key indicator of the robustness of financial institutions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  法定准备金的起源可以追溯到19世纪的美国银行业危机。当时，由于缺乏统一的资本储备要求，银行频繁倒闭。1913年美联储成立后，逐步引入法定准备金制度以稳定金融系统。中国则在20世纪80年代改革开放后引入这一制度。  
  The origin of statutory reserves can be traced back to the banking crises in the United States in the 19th century. At that time, due to the lack of uniform capital reserve requirements, banks frequently collapsed. After the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, statutory reserve requirements were gradually introduced to stabilize the financial system. China adopted this system after its reform and opening-up in the 1980s.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  法定准备金制度在全球范围内被广泛采用，成为现代金融监管的核心工具之一。在中国，它有效降低了银行系统的流动性风险，并为货币政策提供了重要调控手段。目前，随着金融创新的发展，法定准备金的计算方法和适用范围也在不断调整和完善。  
  The statutory reserve system has been widely adopted globally and has become one of the core tools of modern financial regulation. In China, it has effectively reduced liquidity risks in the banking system and provided an important means for monetary policy regulation. Currently, with the development of financial innovation, calculation methods and application scopes of statutory reserves are continuously being adjusted and improved.
