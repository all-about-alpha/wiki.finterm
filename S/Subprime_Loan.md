# Subprime Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **次级贷款**是指向信用记录较差、还款能力较低的借款人发放的贷款。这类贷款的利率通常较高，以补偿贷款机构承担的更高风险。次级贷款的核心概念在于其高风险性和高回报性，通常用于无法获得传统优质贷款的借款人。  
  A **subprime loan** is a type of loan offered to borrowers with poor credit histories and lower repayment capabilities. These loans typically carry higher interest rates to compensate lenders for the increased risk. The core concept of subprime loans lies in their high-risk, high-reward nature, often targeting borrowers who cannot qualify for traditional prime loans.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，次级贷款主要应用于个人消费贷款、汽车贷款和部分住房抵押贷款领域。由于借款人的信用风险较高，金融机构在发放此类贷款时需严格评估借款人的还款能力，并采取相应的风险控制措施。  
  In China, subprime loans are primarily used in personal consumer loans, auto loans, and certain mortgage sectors. Due to the higher credit risk of borrowers, financial institutions must rigorously assess repayment capabilities and implement corresponding risk control measures when issuing such loans.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，次级贷款的存在有助于满足部分无法获得传统贷款的借款人的融资需求，但也可能引发系统性金融风险。从投资角度看，次级贷款的高利率为投资者提供了更高的回报机会，但同时也伴随着更高的违约风险。从行业角度看，次级贷款的普及推动了金融创新和风险管理技术的发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, subprime loans help meet the financing needs of borrowers who cannot access traditional loans but may also pose systemic financial risks. From an investment standpoint, the high interest rates of subprime loans offer greater return opportunities but come with higher default risks. From an industry perspective, the prevalence of subprime loans has driven financial innovation and risk management technology development.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  次级贷款的起源可以追溯到20世纪80年代的美国，当时金融机构开始向信用记录较差的借款人提供高利率贷款。2000年代初，随着房地产市场的繁荣，次级抵押贷款迅速增长，最终在2007-2008年全球金融危机中扮演了重要角色。  
  The origin of subprime loans dates back to the 1980s in the United States when financial institutions began offering high-interest-rate loans to borrowers with poor credit histories. In the early 2000s, with the booming real estate market, subprime mortgages grew rapidly and ultimately played a significant role in the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，次级贷款的兴起与消费金融的快速发展密切相关。尽管尚未出现类似美国的系统性危机，但监管机构已加强对该领域的监管力度，以防止潜在风险积累。在全球范围内，次贷危机后各国纷纷加强了对金融市场的监管和风险管理要求。  
  In China, the rise of subprime loans is closely tied to the rapid development of consumer finance. Although no systemic crisis akin to that in the U.S. has occurred yet, regulators have strengthened oversight in this area to prevent potential risk accumulation. Globally, post-subprime crisis countries have enhanced financial market regulations and risk management requirements.
