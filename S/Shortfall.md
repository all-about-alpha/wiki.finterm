## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：短差的概念最早可追溯至20世纪初的财务管理实践。随着金融市场的发展和企业规模的扩大，对资金和资源的管理需求日益增加，“短差”逐渐成为衡量财务健康的核心术语之一。例如，1929年大萧条期间，许多企业因现金流短差而破产。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of shortfall can be traced back to early 20th-century financial management practices. With the development of financial markets and the expansion of corporate scale, the need for managing funds and resources grew significantly, making "shortfall" one of the core terms for measuring financial health. For instance, during the Great Depression of 1929, many companies went bankrupt due to cash flow shortfalls.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：短差的出现对金融行业产生了深远影响，促使监管机构加强了对资本充足率和流动性的要求。例如，《巴塞尔协议》对银行资本短差的监管要求显著提高了全球银行业的风险管理水平。目前，短差管理已成为企业财务管理的核心任务之一。  
  **English Impact**: The emergence of shortfalls has had a profound impact on the financial industry, prompting regulators to strengthen requirements for capital adequacy and liquidity. For example, the Basel Accords' regulatory requirements on bank capital shortfalls have significantly improved risk management in the global banking sector. Today, managing shortfalls has become one of the core tasks in corporate financial management.
