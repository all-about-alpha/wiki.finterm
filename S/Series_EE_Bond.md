# Series EE Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Series EE Bond（EE系列债券）是由美国财政部发行的一种非市场流通储蓄债券。该债券以面值的一半出售，但到期时会按面值全额支付。EE债券的利息是固定的，并且在持有期间复利计算，直到债券到期或被赎回。EE债券的期限通常为30年，但在20年后会停止计息。  
  **English Explanation**: A Series EE Bond is a non-marketable savings bond issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These bonds are sold at half of their face value but are redeemed at full face value upon maturity. The interest on EE Bonds is fixed and compounds semiannually until the bond reaches maturity or is redeemed. The typical term for an EE Bond is 30 years, although interest stops accruing after 20 years.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：EE系列债券通常被个人投资者用作长期储蓄工具，尤其适合那些希望获得稳定收益且风险承受能力较低的投资者。由于EE债券的利息收入在联邦层面免税，且在用于教育支出时可能享受州和地方税收优惠，因此常被用于教育储蓄计划。需要注意的是，EE债券的流动性较低，提前赎回可能导致利息损失。  
  **English Explanation**: Series EE Bonds are commonly used by individual investors as a long-term savings tool, particularly suitable for those seeking stable returns with low risk tolerance. Since the interest income from EE Bonds is exempt from federal taxes and may also be exempt from state and local taxes when used for educational expenses, they are often utilized in education savings plans. However, EE Bonds have low liquidity, and early redemption may result in the loss of interest.
