## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    附加费的概念最早可追溯至中世纪欧洲，当时商人为应对战争或自然灾害带来的额外成本，开始在商品价格上附加额外费用。现代附加费的广泛应用始于20世纪，特别是石油危机期间，航空业首次引入燃油附加费以应对油价飙升。此后，附加费逐渐成为各行业应对成本波动的常见手段。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of surcharges dates back to medieval Europe, where merchants added extra fees to commodity prices to cover additional costs caused by wars or natural disasters. The modern widespread use of surcharges began in the 20th century, particularly during the oil crisis, when the airline industry first introduced fuel surcharges to address soaring oil prices. Since then, surcharges have become a common tool across industries to manage cost fluctuations.

    Surcharges have had a profound impact on industries and consumers. For example, fuel surcharges enable airlines to maintain operational stability amid oil price fluctuations but also increase passenger costs.
