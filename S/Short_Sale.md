# Short Sale

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：卖空（Short Sale）是一种投资策略，投资者借入股票或其他证券并立即卖出，期望在未来价格下跌时以更低的价格买回，从而赚取差价。卖空的核心概念是通过市场下跌获利，通常由专业投资者或对冲基金使用。  
  **English Explanation**: A short sale is an investment strategy where an investor borrows shares or other securities and sells them immediately, hoping to buy them back at a lower price in the future to profit from the price decline. The core concept of short selling is to profit from a market downturn, typically used by professional investors or hedge funds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：卖空常用于对冲市场风险或投机性交易。例如，投资者预测某公司股价将因负面新闻下跌时，会进行卖空操作。然而，卖空风险较高，因为如果股价上涨而非下跌，投资者将面临无限亏损的可能。此外，卖空可能加剧市场波动，因此受到监管机构的严格监控。  
  **English Explanation**: Short selling is often used for hedging market risks or speculative trading. For example, if an investor predicts that a company's stock price will drop due to negative news, they may engage in short selling. However, short selling carries high risks because if the stock price rises instead of falls, the investor faces potentially unlimited losses. Additionally, short selling can exacerbate market volatility and is therefore closely monitored by regulatory authorities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，卖空有助于提高市场效率，因为它可以揭示被高估的资产价格。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了在市场下跌时获利的工具。然而，过度卖空可能导致市场恐慌和系统性风险，因此需要平衡其利弊。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, short selling helps improve market efficiency by revealing overvalued assets. From an investment perspective, it provides investors with a tool to profit during market downturns. However, excessive short selling can lead to market panic and systemic risks, necessitating a balance between its benefits and drawbacks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：卖空的起源可以追溯到17世纪的荷兰金融市场。当时投资者通过借入股票并卖出以应对市场波动。现代卖空机制在20世纪初的美国股市中得到广泛应用，尤其是在1929年大萧条期间成为争议焦点。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of short selling dates back to the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century when investors borrowed and sold stocks to navigate market fluctuations. Modern short-selling mechanisms became widely used in the U.S. stock market in the early 20th century and were particularly controversial during the Great Depression of 1929.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：卖空对金融市场的影响深远。它既有助于发现资产真实价值，也可能引发市场恐慌和崩盘。例如2008年金融危机期间，部分金融机构因过度卖空而倒闭。目前全球主要金融市场对卖空行为均有严格监管措施。  
  **English Explanation**: Short selling has had a profound impact on financial markets. It helps uncover the true value of assets but can also trigger market panic and crashes. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, some financial institutions collapsed due to excessive short selling. Currently, major global financial markets have stringent regulations on short-selling activities.
