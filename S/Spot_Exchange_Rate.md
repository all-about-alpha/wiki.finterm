## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  即期汇率的起源可以追溯到19世纪的金本位制时期，当时各国货币与黄金挂钩，外汇交易以黄金为基础进行结算。随着布雷顿森林体系的建立和瓦解，浮动汇率制度逐渐取代固定汇率制度，即期汇率的市场化定价机制得以形成。  
  The concept of the Spot Exchange Rate dates back to the gold standard in the 19th century when currencies were pegged to gold, and foreign exchange transactions were settled based on gold. With the establishment and collapse of the Bretton Woods system, floating exchange rates gradually replaced fixed rates, leading to the development of a market-driven pricing mechanism for Spot Exchange Rates.
