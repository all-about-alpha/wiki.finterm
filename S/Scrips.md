  **English Explanation**  
  Scrips are temporary financial instruments issued by companies or governments to substitute cash payments for dividends, interest, or other obligations.

Scrips are often issued to address short-term liquidity issues or to defer cash payments.

  Scrips are commonly used by companies facing cash flow constraints as a substitute for dividend or interest payments. For example, a company may issue scrips instead of cash dividends when it lacks sufficient liquidity.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  Scrips的概念最早可以追溯到19世纪，当时一些公司因资金短缺而无法支付现金股息，转而发行临时凭证作为替代。这种做法的初衷是为了维持股东的信心，同时为公司争取更多时间筹集资金。20世纪初，Scrips的使用逐渐扩展到政府债券领域，特别是在经济危机期间。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of scrips dates back to the 19th century when some companies, unable to pay cash dividends due to financial shortages, issued temporary certificates as substitutes.
