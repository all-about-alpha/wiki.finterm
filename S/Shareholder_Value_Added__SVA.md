# Shareholder Value Added (SVA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：股东价值增值（Shareholder Value Added, SVA）是一种衡量公司为股东创造价值能力的财务指标。它通过计算公司税后净营业利润减去资本成本后的余额，来评估公司是否有效地利用了资本资源。SVA的核心概念是确保公司创造的利润超过其资本成本，从而为股东带来真正的价值增值。这一概念最早由美国管理咨询公司Stern Stewart & Co.在20世纪80年代提出。  
  **English Explanation**: Shareholder Value Added (SVA) is a financial metric used to measure a company's ability to create value for its shareholders. It calculates the excess of a company's after-tax net operating profit over its cost of capital, thereby assessing whether the company has effectively utilized its capital resources. The core concept of SVA is to ensure that the profits generated by the company exceed its cost of capital, thereby delivering real value-added to shareholders. This concept was first introduced by the American management consulting firm Stern Stewart & Co. in the 1980s.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：SVA的概念起源于20世纪80年代，由美国管理咨询公司Stern Stewart & Co.提出。当时，传统的财务指标如净利润和每股收益（EPS）无法全面反映企业的价值创造能力。Stern Stewart & Co.通过引入经济利润（Economic Profit）的概念，提出了SVA，旨在更准确地衡量企业为股东创造的价值。这一概念的提出标志着企业绩效评估从传统的会计利润向经济利润的转变。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of SVA originated in the 1980s, introduced by the American management consulting firm Stern Stewart & Co. At that time, traditional financial metrics such as net profit and earnings per share (EPS) were insufficient to fully reflect a company's value creation capabilities. Stern Stewart & Co. proposed SVA by introducing the concept of Economic Profit, aiming to more accurately measure the value created for shareholders. This marked a shift in corporate performance evaluation from traditional accounting profits to economic profits.
