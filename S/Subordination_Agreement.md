# Subordination Agreement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：次级协议（Subordination Agreement）是一种法律文件，用于规定某一债权人对另一债权人的债权优先权的放弃或调整。通常，次级债权人同意在特定条件下，其债权在清偿顺序上低于优先债权人。这种协议常见于企业融资、债务重组或破产清算等场景，旨在保护优先债权人的利益。  
  **English Explanation**: A Subordination Agreement is a legal document that stipulates the waiver or adjustment of a creditor's priority over another creditor's claims. Typically, the subordinated creditor agrees that their claim will rank lower in the repayment hierarchy under specific conditions. This agreement is commonly used in corporate financing, debt restructuring, or bankruptcy proceedings to protect the interests of senior creditors.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：次级协议广泛应用于企业融资中，尤其是在多轮融资或债务重组过程中。例如，初创企业在进行多轮融资时，早期投资者可能签署次级协议，以确保后续投资者的优先权。此外，在破产清算中，次级协议有助于明确债权清偿顺序，避免法律纠纷。需要注意的是，次级债权人需充分评估风险，因为其债权可能无法全额收回。  
  **English Application**: Subordination Agreements are widely used in corporate financing, particularly in multi-round financing or debt restructuring. For example, early-stage investors in a startup may sign a subordination agreement to ensure the priority of subsequent investors. Additionally, in bankruptcy proceedings, such agreements help clarify the order of debt repayment and avoid legal disputes. It is important for subordinated creditors to fully assess risks, as their claims may not be fully recovered.
