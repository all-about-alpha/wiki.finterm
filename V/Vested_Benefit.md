# Vested Benefit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Vested Benefit（既得利益）是指员工在满足特定条件后，对其雇主提供的福利计划（如养老金、股票期权等）所享有的不可撤销的权利。这些条件通常包括服务年限或达到特定业绩目标。一旦利益既得，员工即使离职也能保留这些福利。  
  **English Explanation**: Vested Benefit refers to the irrevocable right an employee has to the benefits provided by their employer (such as pensions, stock options, etc.) after meeting specific conditions. These conditions typically include years of service or achieving certain performance goals. Once vested, the employee retains these benefits even if they leave the company.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：既得利益常见于企业养老金计划、股权激励计划等场景。例如，员工在公司工作满五年后，其养老金账户中的部分资金将变为既得利益，即使离职也能领取。风险在于，如果员工未达到既得条件，可能无法享受这些福利。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Vested benefits are commonly seen in corporate pension plans, equity incentive plans, etc. For example, after an employee has worked for a company for five years, a portion of their pension account becomes vested, and they can claim it even if they leave the company. The risk is that if the employee does not meet the vesting conditions, they may not be able to enjoy these benefits.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，既得利益确保了员工的长期权益；从投资角度看，它激励员工长期留任；从行业角度看，它是企业吸引和保留人才的重要手段。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, vested benefits ensure long-term rights for employees; from an investment perspective, they incentivize employees to stay long-term; from an industry perspective, they are a crucial tool for attracting and retaining talent.
