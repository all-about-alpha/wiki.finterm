# Vesting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 归属（Vesting）是指员工或投资者逐步获得对某项资产（如股票、期权或退休金）的所有权的过程。通常，归属期是预先设定的时间段，在此期间，员工或投资者通过满足特定条件（如工作年限或业绩目标）逐步获得这些权益。  
  **English Explanation**: Vesting refers to the process by which an employee or investor gradually gains ownership of an asset, such as stocks, options, or retirement benefits. Typically, a vesting period is a predetermined timeframe during which the individual earns these rights by meeting specific conditions, such as years of service or performance targets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 归属机制广泛应用于企业股权激励计划中，旨在通过长期绑定核心员工与公司利益，提升员工忠诚度和工作积极性。例如，某公司可能规定员工需在公司工作满四年才能完全获得授予的股票期权。风险在于，如果员工在归属期内离职，可能无法获得全部权益。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Vesting mechanisms are widely used in corporate equity incentive plans to align the interests of key employees with the company over the long term, thereby enhancing loyalty and motivation. For example, a company may stipulate that employees must work for four years to fully vest in granted stock options. The risk is that if an employee leaves before the vesting period ends, they may forfeit some or all of their rights.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，归属机制有助于防止短期套利行为，保护公司和股东利益；从投资角度看，它能够激励管理层和员工为公司的长期发展努力；从行业角度看，归属已成为现代企业管理中不可或缺的工具。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, vesting helps prevent short-term profit-seeking behaviors and protects the interests of companies and shareholders. From an investment standpoint, it incentivizes management and employees to focus on long-term growth. From an industry perspective, vesting has become an essential tool in modern corporate management.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 归属的概念最早可追溯到20世纪中期美国企业的股权激励计划。随着企业规模的扩大和市场竞争的加剧，公司开始采用归属机制来吸引和留住人才。1970年代后，随着《雇员退休收入保障法》（ERISA）的出台，归属在退休金计划中的应用得到进一步规范。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of vesting dates back to mid-20th century American corporate equity incentive plans. As companies grew larger and market competition intensified, firms began using vesting mechanisms to attract and retain talent. After the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in the 1970s, vesting became more standardized in retirement benefit plans.
