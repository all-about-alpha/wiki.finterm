# Value Fund

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**: 价值基金是一种专注于投资被市场低估的股票的基金。其核心理念是“低买高卖”，即寻找市场价格低于其内在价值的股票，等待市场重新评估后获得收益。价值投资的理念最早由本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）和大卫·多德（David Dodd）在20世纪30年代提出。  
  - **English Explanation**: A value fund is a type of mutual fund or investment strategy that focuses on purchasing stocks that are undervalued by the market.

  - **English Application**: Value funds are typically suited for long-term investors who are willing to wait for the market to recognize undervalued stocks. Common scenarios include identifying high-quality companies during economic downturns. However, value investing may require patience, as returns can take time to materialize, and there is a risk of prolonged undervaluation.
