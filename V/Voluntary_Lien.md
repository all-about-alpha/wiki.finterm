# Voluntary Lien

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：自愿留置权（Voluntary Lien）是指财产所有者自愿将其财产作为担保，以确保债务的履行。这种留置权通常通过合同或协议的形式确立，例如抵押贷款或质押贷款。核心概念在于财产所有者主动同意将财产权益让渡给债权人，以换取资金或其他利益。  
  **English Explanation**: A voluntary lien is a lien placed on a property with the consent of the property owner, typically to secure a debt. This type of lien is usually established through a contract or agreement, such as a mortgage or a pledge. The core concept lies in the property owner's voluntary agreement to transfer property rights to the creditor in exchange for funds or other benefits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：自愿留置权常见于房地产抵押贷款、汽车贷款或商业融资等场景。例如，购房者通过签署抵押合同，将房产作为贷款的担保。风险在于，如果借款人未能按时还款，债权人有权依法处置抵押财产以弥补损失。  
  **English Explanation**: Voluntary liens are commonly used in scenarios such as real estate mortgages, auto loans, or business financing. For example, a homebuyer signs a mortgage agreement, using the property as collateral for the loan. The risk is that if the borrower fails to repay on time, the creditor has the right to dispose of the collateral to recover losses.
