# Value-Added Tax (VAT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：增值税（Value-Added Tax，简称VAT）是一种消费税，针对商品或服务在生产、流通和消费过程中每个环节的增值部分征税。它由法国经济学家莫里斯·洛雷（Maurice Lauré）于1954年首次提出并实施。增值税的核心概念是“增值”，即企业在销售商品或提供服务时，对其新增价值部分征税，而非对全部销售额征税。  
  **English Explanation**: Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax levied on the incremental value added to goods or services at each stage of production, distribution, and consumption. It was first proposed and implemented by French economist Maurice Lauré in 1954. The core concept of VAT is "value addition," meaning that businesses are taxed on the additional value they create when selling goods or services, rather than on the total sales revenue.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：增值税广泛应用于中国各个行业，包括制造业、零售业和服务业。在中国，增值税的税率根据商品和服务的类型有所不同，通常分为标准税率、低税率和零税率。企业在销售商品或提供服务时需向税务机关申报并缴纳增值税，同时可以抵扣进项税额。需要注意的是，企业需确保发票合规性，以避免税务风险。  
  **English Explanation**: VAT is widely applied across various industries in China, including manufacturing, retail, and services. In China, VAT rates vary depending on the type of goods or services, typically categorized into standard rates, reduced rates, and zero rates. Businesses must declare and pay VAT to tax authorities when selling goods or providing services, while also being able to deduct input taxes. It is crucial for businesses to ensure invoice compliance to avoid tax-related risks.
