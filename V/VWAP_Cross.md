# VWAP Cross

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：VWAP Cross（成交量加权平均价交叉）是指股票或其他金融资产的价格在交易日内与其成交量加权平均价（VWAP）发生交叉的现象。VWAP是衡量某一时间段内资产平均交易价格的指标，通过将总交易金额除以总交易量计算得出。当价格从上方或下方穿过VWAP线时，称为VWAP Cross。  
  **English Explanation**: VWAP Cross refers to the phenomenon where the price of a stock or other financial asset crosses its Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) during a trading day. VWAP is an indicator that measures the average trading price of an asset over a specific period, calculated by dividing the total trading value by the total trading volume. When the price crosses the VWAP line from above or below, it is called a VWAP Cross.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：VWAP Cross常用于技术分析中，帮助投资者判断市场趋势和买卖时机。例如，当价格从下方上穿VWAP时，可能被视为买入信号；反之，当价格从上方下穿VWAP时，可能被视为卖出信号。此外，机构投资者常用VWAP作为执行大额交易的基准价，以减少市场冲击。需要注意的是，VWAP Cross并非绝对可靠的指标，需结合其他技术指标和市场环境综合判断。  
  **English Explanation**: VWAP Cross is commonly used in technical analysis to help investors identify market trends and trading opportunities. For example, when the price crosses above the VWAP from below, it may be considered a buy signal; conversely, when the price crosses below the VWAP from above, it may be considered a sell signal. Additionally, institutional investors often use VWAP as a benchmark for executing large trades to minimize market impact. It is important to note that VWAP Cross is not an infallible indicator and should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators and market conditions.
