# Vulture Fund

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **秃鹫基金**是一种专门投资于陷入财务困境或破产企业的基金，通常以极低的价格购买这些企业的债务或资产，然后通过法律手段或重组等方式获取高额回报。其名称来源于秃鹫以腐肉为食的特性，比喻这类基金以“濒死”企业为目标的投资策略。  
  A **vulture fund** is a type of investment fund that specializes in purchasing distressed or bankrupt companies' debt or assets at deeply discounted prices, aiming to profit through legal actions, restructuring, or other means. The term derives from the vulture's scavenging behavior, symbolizing the fund's focus on "dying" companies.

* **应用 / Application**  
  秃鹫基金通常应用于企业破产重组、债务违约或主权债务危机等场景。投资者通过低价收购债权或资产，利用法律手段追讨债务或推动企业重组，以实现高额回报。然而，这类投资风险较高，可能面临法律纠纷、市场波动以及道德争议等问题。  
  Vulture funds are typically applied in scenarios such as corporate bankruptcy restructuring, debt defaults, or sovereign debt crises. Investors purchase debt or assets at low prices and use legal means to recover debts or push for restructuring to achieve high returns. However, such investments carry significant risks, including legal disputes, market volatility, and ethical controversies.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，秃鹫基金的存在可能对金融市场稳定性和企业复苏产生双重影响：一方面，它们为困境企业提供了流动性支持；另一方面，其激进的投资策略可能引发道德和法律争议。从投资角度看，秃鹫基金为高风险偏好者提供了高回报机会。从行业角度看，这类基金推动了不良资产市场的活跃度。  
  From a regulatory perspective, vulture funds have a dual impact on financial market stability and corporate recovery: they provide liquidity support to distressed companies but may also trigger ethical and legal disputes due to their aggressive strategies. From an investment perspective, they offer high-return opportunities for risk-tolerant investors. From an industry perspective, these funds drive activity in the distressed asset market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  秃鹫基金的起源可以追溯到20世纪80年代美国的企业破产潮和垃圾债券市场崩盘时期。当时一些投资者开始低价收购陷入困境企业的债务或资产，并通过法律手段追讨债务或推动重组获利。这一策略逐渐演变为一种专门的投资模式。  
  The origin of vulture funds can be traced back to the 1980s during the U.S. corporate bankruptcy wave and the collapse of the junk bond market. Some investors began purchasing distressed companies' debt or assets at low prices and profiting through legal actions or restructuring efforts. This strategy gradually evolved into a specialized investment model.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  秃鹫基金在全球范围内对不良资产市场产生了深远影响。它们不仅推动了企业破产重组的进程，还为主权债务危机中的国家提供了解决方案。然而，其激进的投资策略也引发了广泛争议，尤其是在涉及发展中国家主权债务时，被批评为“剥削性”行为。  
  Vulture funds have had a profound impact on the global distressed asset market. They have not only accelerated corporate bankruptcy restructuring but also provided solutions for countries in sovereign debt crises. However, their aggressive strategies have sparked widespread controversy, particularly when involving developing countries' sovereign debts, often criticized as "exploitative."
