# Volume Analysis

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  成交量分析（Volume Analysis）是一种通过研究市场交易量来预测价格走势的技术分析方法。它基于“量在价先”的核心概念，认为交易量的变化往往先于价格变动，是市场情绪和趋势的重要指标。  
  Volume Analysis is a technical analysis method that predicts price movements by studying market trading volume. It is based on the core concept that "volume precedes price," suggesting that changes in trading volume often precede price movements and serve as a key indicator of market sentiment and trends.

* **应用 / Application**  
  成交量分析广泛应用于股票、期货、外汇等金融市场。例如，当价格上涨伴随成交量放大时，通常被视为上涨趋势的确认；反之，若价格上涨但成交量萎缩，则可能预示趋势反转。投资者需注意虚假信号和异常波动带来的风险。  
  Volume Analysis is widely used in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and forex. For instance, a price increase accompanied by rising volume is often seen as confirmation of an upward trend; conversely, a price increase with declining volume may signal a trend reversal. Investors should be cautious of false signals and abnormal fluctuations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，成交量分析有助于识别市场操纵行为；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了判断市场趋势和入场时机的依据；从行业角度看，它是量化交易和算法模型的重要输入参数。  
  From a regulatory perspective, Volume Analysis helps identify market manipulation; from an investment perspective, it provides investors with insights into market trends and entry points; from an industry perspective, it serves as a critical input for quantitative trading and algorithmic models.
