# Value Stock

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **价值股**是指那些市场价格低于其内在价值的股票，通常由基本面分析得出。这类股票通常具有较低的市盈率（P/E）、市净率（P/B）和高股息收益率。价值投资理念由本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）和大卫·多德（David Dodd）在20世纪30年代提出，强调以低于其内在价值的价格购买股票，以获得长期收益。  
  **Value Stock** refers to stocks that are trading at a price lower than their intrinsic value, typically determined through fundamental analysis. These stocks usually have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book (P/B) ratios, and high dividend yields. The concept of value investing was introduced by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in the 1930s, emphasizing the purchase of stocks at prices below their intrinsic value for long-term gains.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，价值股通常出现在传统行业如银行、能源和制造业中。投资者通过分析公司的财务报表、行业地位和宏观经济环境来识别价值股。需要注意的是，价值股可能面临市场低估的风险，且短期内价格可能不会迅速回升。  
  In China, value stocks are often found in traditional industries such as banking, energy, and manufacturing. Investors identify value stocks by analyzing companies' financial statements, industry position, and macroeconomic environment. It is important to note that value stocks may face the risk of being undervalued by the market and may not see a quick price rebound in the short term.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，价值股有助于市场稳定，减少投机行为。从投资角度看，价值股为投资者提供了长期稳健的回报机会。从行业角度看，价值股的挖掘有助于发现被低估的优质企业，促进资源优化配置。  
  From a regulatory perspective, value stocks contribute to market stability by reducing speculative behavior. From an investment perspective, they offer opportunities for long-term steady returns.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  价值投资的理念起源于20世纪30年代的经济大萧条时期。本杰明·格雷厄姆和大卫·多德在其著作《证券分析》（Security Analysis）中首次系统阐述了这一理论。他们认为，通过深入分析公司的基本面，投资者可以找到被市场低估的股票并从中获利。  
  The concept of value investing originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd first systematically articulated this theory in their book "Security Analysis."
