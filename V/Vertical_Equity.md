# Vertical Equity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 垂直公平（Vertical Equity）是税收和财政政策中的一个原则，强调不同经济能力的纳税人应承担不同的税负。具体来说，收入较高的人应缴纳更多的税款，而收入较低的人则应缴纳较少的税款。这一原则旨在通过税收实现社会财富的再分配，减少贫富差距。  
  **English Explanation**: Vertical Equity is a principle in taxation and fiscal policy that emphasizes that taxpayers with different economic capacities should bear different tax burdens. Specifically, individuals with higher incomes should pay more in taxes, while those with lower incomes should pay less. This principle aims to achieve social wealth redistribution through taxation and reduce income inequality.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 垂直公平广泛应用于累进税制的设计中，例如个人所得税和公司所得税。在这些税制中，税率随着收入的增加而提高。然而，实施垂直公平时需注意避免过度征税对高收入者的激励产生负面影响，同时确保低收入群体的基本生活需求得到保障。  
  **English Explanation**: Vertical Equity is widely applied in the design of progressive tax systems, such as personal income tax and corporate income tax. In these systems, tax rates increase as income rises. However, when implementing vertical equity, it is important to avoid excessive taxation that could negatively impact the incentives of high-income earners while ensuring the basic living needs of low-income groups are met.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，垂直公平有助于实现税收的公正性和社会稳定性；从投资角度看，合理的税收政策可以促进经济长期增长；从行业角度看，垂直公平有助于优化资源配置和提升社会福利水平。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, vertical equity helps achieve fairness and social stability in taxation; from an investment perspective, reasonable tax policies can promote long-term economic growth; from an industry perspective, vertical equity helps optimize resource allocation and improve social welfare levels.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 垂直公平的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末的经济学家阿道夫·瓦格纳（Adolf Wagner），他在其著作中提出了“税收能力原则”，认为税收应根据纳税人的支付能力进行调整。20世纪初，随着福利国家的兴起，这一原则被广泛应用于各国的税收政策中。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of vertical equity can be traced back to the late 19th-century economist Adolf Wagner, who proposed the "ability-to-pay principle" in his works, suggesting that taxes should be adjusted according to taxpayers' ability to pay. In the early 20th century, with the rise of welfare states, this principle was widely applied in tax policies across various countries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: 垂直公平的实施对全球税收体系产生了深远影响，特别是在发达国家中，累进税制已成为主流。然而，近年来随着全球化的发展和国际竞争的加剧，一些国家开始调整其税收政策以吸引投资和人才，这在一定程度上削弱了垂直公平的实施效果。  
  **English Explanation**: The implementation of vertical equity has had a profound impact on global tax systems, particularly in developed countries where progressive taxation has become mainstream. However, in recent years, with globalization and increased international competition, some countries have begun adjusting their tax policies to attract investment and talent, which has somewhat weakened the effectiveness of vertical equity.
