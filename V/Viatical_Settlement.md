# Viatical Settlement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Viatical Settlement（生命保险金提前结算）是一种金融交易，指身患绝症或重病的保单持有人将其人寿保险单以折扣价出售给第三方投资者，以换取一笔现金。这种交易允许保单持有人在生前获得部分保险金，而投资者则在其去世后获得全额保险金。  
  **English Explanation**: A Viatical Settlement is a financial transaction where a terminally or chronically ill policyholder sells their life insurance policy at a discount to a third-party investor in exchange for a lump sum of cash. This allows the policyholder to access a portion of their death benefit while alive, and the investor receives the full benefit upon the policyholder's death.

  **English Application Scenarios**: Viatical Settlements are often used to help critically ill individuals cover medical expenses or improve their quality of life. However, these transactions carry ethical risks and regulatory challenges, such as potential misassessment of the policyholder's health by investors. Additionally, regulations vary significantly by region, requiring careful consideration.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文历史背景**：Viatical Settlement起源于20世纪80年代的美国艾滋病危机期间。当时许多患者急需资金支付高昂的医疗费用，而人寿保险公司拒绝提前支付保险金。于是，一些金融公司开始购买这些患者的保单，为他们提供现金支持。这一模式逐渐发展成为一种正式的金融产品。  
  **English Historical Background**: Viatical Settlements originated in the United States during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. Many patients urgently needed funds to cover high medical costs, but life insurance companies refused to pay benefits early. Financial firms began purchasing these policies, providing cash support to patients. This model evolved into a formal financial product.
