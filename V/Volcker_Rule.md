## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：沃尔克规则（Volcker Rule）是美国金融监管法规的一部分，由前美联储主席保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）提出，旨在限制银行从事自营交易（proprietary trading）和投资对冲基金或私募股权基金的能力。其核心目标是减少银行因高风险交易活动而引发的系统性风险，保护存款人和金融系统的稳定性。  
  **English Explanation**: The Volcker Rule is a component of U.S. financial regulation, proposed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, designed to restrict banks from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in hedge funds or private equity funds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：沃尔克规则主要适用于美国的大型银行和金融机构，要求它们将自营交易与客户服务业务分离，并限制其对高风险基金的投资。在实施过程中，银行需建立严格的合规机制，确保交易活动符合监管要求。然而，规则的复杂性也增加了银行的合规成本和管理难度。  
  **English Explanation**: The Volcker Rule primarily applies to large U.S. banks and financial institutions, requiring them to separate proprietary trading from client services and limit investments in high-risk funds. In practice, banks must establish robust compliance mechanisms to ensure their activities align with regulatory requirements.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：沃尔克规则的提出源于2008年全球金融危机。危机中，许多大型银行因从事高风险的自营交易而蒙受巨额损失，进而威胁到整个金融系统的稳定。2010年，《多德-弗兰克华尔街改革与消费者保护法案》（Dodd-Frank Act）通过后，沃尔克规则被纳入其中并于2013年正式生效。保罗·沃尔克的理念是“银行不应利用纳税人的钱进行赌博式交易”。  
  **English Explanation**: The Volcker Rule originated from the 2008 global financial crisis. During the crisis, many large banks suffered massive losses due to high-risk proprietary trading, threatening the stability of the entire financial system. After the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, the Volcker Rule was incorporated into it and officially took effect in 2013. Paul Volcker's philosophy was that "banks should not use taxpayer money for gambling-like trades."

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：沃尔克规则的实施对全球银行业产生了深远影响。它迫使许多银行剥离自营交易部门或调整业务结构，同时也推动了全球其他国家和地区加强类似监管措施。尽管该规则在一定程度上降低了系统性风险，但其复杂性和执行难度也引发了争议和改革呼声。目前，美国仍在不断调整和完善该规则的实施细则。  
  **English Explanation**: The implementation of the Volcker Rule has had a profound impact on global banking. It forced many banks to divest proprietary trading divisions or restructure their businesses while also prompting other countries and regions to strengthen similar regulatory measures. Although the rule has reduced systemic risks to some extent, its complexity and enforcement challenges have sparked debates and calls for reform. Currently, adjustments and refinements to its implementation details are ongoing in the U.S.
