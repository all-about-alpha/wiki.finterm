# Vulture Capitalist

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **秃鹫资本家** 是指那些专门投资于陷入财务困境或濒临破产的企业，通过低价收购其资产或债务，然后通过重组、出售或其他手段获取高额利润的投资者或投资机构。这类投资者通常被视为冷酷无情，因为他们往往在企业最脆弱的时候介入，以极低的价格获取利益。  
  **Vulture Capitalist** refers to investors or investment firms that specialize in investing in financially distressed or nearly bankrupt companies. They acquire assets or debts at low prices and then profit through restructuring, selling, or other means. These investors are often seen as ruthless because they typically intervene when companies are most vulnerable, securing profits at minimal costs.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，秃鹫资本家的行为常见于不良资产处置市场。他们通过收购银行或金融机构的不良贷款，然后通过法律手段追讨债务或重组企业来实现盈利。然而，这种行为可能引发道德争议，尤其是在涉及国有企业或员工利益时。  
  In China, vulture capitalists are often active in the non-performing asset disposal market. They purchase non-performing loans from banks or financial institutions and then profit by pursuing debt recovery or restructuring companies through legal means. However, such actions can spark ethical debates, especially when state-owned enterprises or employee interests are involved.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，秃鹫资本家的存在有助于清理金融系统中的不良资产，促进市场资源的重新配置。但从投资和行业角度看，他们的行为可能加剧企业破产风险，甚至引发社会不稳定。因此，监管机构需要在鼓励市场效率和防范道德风险之间找到平衡。  
  From a regulatory perspective, vulture capitalists help clean up non-performing assets in the financial system and promote the reallocation of market resources. However, from an investment and industry perspective, their actions may exacerbate bankruptcy risks and even lead to social instability. Therefore, regulators need to strike a balance between encouraging market efficiency and preventing moral hazards.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  秃鹫资本家的概念起源于20世纪80年代的美国，当时大量企业因经济衰退和高杠杆率陷入困境。一些投资者抓住机会，低价收购这些企业的债务或资产，并通过重组或出售获利。这一现象在2008年全球金融危机后再次兴起，成为不良资产投资领域的重要策略。  
  The concept of vulture capitalists originated in the United States in the 1980s, when many companies faced financial distress due to economic recession and high leverage. Some investors seized the opportunity to acquire these companies' debts or assets at low prices and profited through restructuring or selling. This phenomenon resurged after the 2008 global financial crisis, becoming a key strategy in the distressed asset investment field.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  秃鹫资本家的行为对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。他们通过清理不良资产，帮助金融机构减轻负担，但也因“趁火打劫”的形象引发争议。在中国，随着不良资产市场的扩大，秃鹫资本家的角色逐渐受到关注，但其活动仍受到严格监管。  
  The actions of vulture capitalists have had a profound impact on global financial markets. By cleaning up non-performing assets, they help financial institutions reduce burdens, but their "profiting from distress" image has also sparked controversy. In China, as the non-performing asset market expands, the role of vulture capitalists has gradually gained attention, though their activities remain tightly regulated.
