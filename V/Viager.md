# Viager

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **Viager** 是一种源自法国的房地产交易方式，通常涉及老年人将其房产出售给买家，但买家在卖家（通常是老年人）去世后才完全拥有房产。在此期间，买家需按月支付一笔款项（称为“租金”）给卖家，同时允许卖家继续居住在该房产中。这种交易方式的核心概念是“终身年金”和“延迟所有权”。  
  **Viager** is a real estate transaction method originating from France, typically involving elderly individuals selling their property to buyers, but the buyers only fully own the property after the seller (usually the elderly person) passes away. During this period, the buyer is required to make monthly payments (known as "rent") to the seller, while allowing the seller to continue living in the property. The core concepts of this transaction are "life annuity" and "deferred ownership."

* **应用 / Application**  
  在法国，Viager 常用于老年人希望通过出售房产获得稳定收入的情况。买家通常需要评估卖家的健康状况和预期寿命，以确定交易的风险和收益。这种交易方式对卖家来说提供了经济保障，但对买家来说存在不确定性，因为支付期限取决于卖家的寿命。  
  In France, Viager is commonly used by elderly individuals who wish to secure a stable income by selling their property. Buyers typically need to assess the seller's health and life expectancy to determine the risks and rewards of the transaction. This method provides financial security for sellers but introduces uncertainty for buyers, as the payment period depends on the seller's lifespan.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从投资角度来看，Viager 提供了一种独特的房地产投资机会，但其风险较高，因为买家的回报取决于卖家的寿命。从行业角度来看，这种交易方式为老年人提供了一种灵活的财务解决方案，同时也为房地产市场注入了新的活力。  
  From an investment perspective, Viager offers a unique real estate investment opportunity, but it carries high risks as the buyer's return depends on the seller's lifespan. From an industry perspective, this transaction method provides a flexible financial solution for elderly individuals and injects new vitality into the real estate market.
