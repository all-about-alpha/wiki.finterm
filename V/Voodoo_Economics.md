# Voodoo Economics

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Voodoo Economics（巫毒经济学）是一个贬义词，通常用来批评那些看似不切实际或缺乏科学依据的经济政策，尤其是那些声称通过减税或放松管制能够刺激经济增长，但实际效果存疑的政策。该术语最早由美国前总统乔治·H·W·布什在1980年共和党初选期间提出，用于批评罗纳德·里根的“供给侧经济学”政策。  
  **English Explanation**: Voodoo Economics is a pejorative term used to criticize economic policies that appear unrealistic or lack scientific basis, particularly those that claim to stimulate economic growth through tax cuts or deregulation but whose actual effectiveness is questionable. The term was first coined by former U.S. President George H. W. Bush during the 1980 Republican primary to criticize Ronald Reagan's "supply-side economics" policies.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Voodoo Economics常用于政治辩论中，用来质疑对手的经济政策是否真正有效。例如，当政府提出大幅减税以刺激经济增长时，反对者可能会指责其为“巫毒经济学”，认为其忽视了财政赤字和收入不平等等潜在问题。  
  **English Application**: Voodoo Economics is often used in political debates to question the effectiveness of opponents' economic policies. For example, when a government proposes significant tax cuts to stimulate economic growth, critics may label it as "voodoo economics," arguing that it overlooks potential issues such as fiscal deficits and income inequality.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，Voodoo Economics提醒人们警惕那些看似诱人但缺乏实际依据的经济政策。它强调了经济政策的科学性和可持续性，避免因短期利益而忽视长期风险。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Voodoo Economics serves as a cautionary reminder to be wary of economic policies that appear attractive but lack substantive evidence. It emphasizes the importance of scientific rigor and sustainability in economic policymaking, avoiding long-term risks for short-term gains.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：Voodoo Economics一词起源于1980年美国共和党初选期间。当时乔治·H·W·布什作为罗纳德·里根的竞争对手，批评里根的供给侧经济学政策为“巫毒经济学”，认为其减税计划无法真正促进经济增长，反而可能导致财政赤字扩大。尽管布什后来成为里根的副总统，这一术语却被广泛传播并沿用至今。  
  **English Origin**: The term Voodoo Economics originated during the 1980 U.S. Republican primary when George H. W. Bush, as Ronald Reagan's rival, criticized Reagan's supply-side economics policies as "voodoo economics." Bush argued that Reagan's tax cut plans would not genuinely stimulate economic growth but could instead lead to increased fiscal deficits. Although Bush later became Reagan's vice president, the term gained widespread usage and remains in use today.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：Voodoo Economics的提出引发了关于供给侧经济学的广泛讨论和争议。尽管里根的政策在一定程度上推动了美国经济的复苏，但其长期影响仍存在争议。该术语也成为了批评类似经济政策的常用工具，提醒人们在制定经济政策时需谨慎权衡利弊。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of Voodoo Economics sparked extensive debate and controversy over supply-side economics. While Reagan's policies contributed to some extent to the U.S. economic recovery, their long-term effects remain contested.
