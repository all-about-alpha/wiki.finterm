  **中文解释**：投票信托协议（Voting Trust Agreements）是一种法律合同，股东将其股份的投票权委托给一个或多个受托人，由受托人代表股东行使投票权。这种协议通常在公司重组、并购或控制权争夺等情况下使用，以确保投票权的集中和统一行使。核心概念包括委托、受托人职责和投票权的集中管理。  
  **English Explanation**: A Voting Trust Agreement is a legal contract where shareholders transfer their voting rights to one or more trustees, who then exercise these rights on behalf of the shareholders.
