# Vehicle Excise Duty (VED)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **车辆消费税（Vehicle Excise Duty, VED）** 是英国政府对在公共道路上行驶的车辆征收的一种税。该税种根据车辆的排放水平、燃料类型和注册日期等因素计算，旨在鼓励使用环保型车辆并减少环境污染。  
  **Vehicle Excise Duty (VED)** is a tax levied by the UK government on vehicles driven on public roads. The tax is calculated based on factors such as the vehicle's emission levels, fuel type, and registration date, aiming to encourage the use of environmentally friendly vehicles and reduce pollution.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在英国，所有车主必须为其车辆缴纳车辆消费税，除非车辆符合免税条件（如电动车或某些低排放车辆）。未缴纳该税的车主可能面临罚款或其他法律后果。  
  In the UK, all vehicle owners must pay Vehicle Excise Duty unless their vehicle qualifies for an exemption (e.g., electric vehicles or certain low-emission vehicles). Failure to pay this duty may result in fines or other legal consequences.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  车辆消费税在英国交通政策中扮演重要角色，不仅为政府提供财政收入，还通过差异化税率推动环保技术的应用和普及。从投资角度看，低排放车辆的税收优惠可能影响消费者的购车决策，进而影响汽车行业的市场格局。  
  Vehicle Excise Duty plays a significant role in UK transportation policy, not only providing government revenue but also promoting the adoption of green technologies through differentiated tax rates. From an investment perspective, tax incentives for low-emission vehicles may influence consumer purchasing decisions and shape the automotive market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  车辆消费税最早可追溯到1888年英国的《道路机车法》（Locomotives on Highways Act），当时主要针对蒸汽机车征税。1920年，《道路交通法》（Road Traffic Act）正式引入机动车税，后经多次改革演变为今天的车辆消费税。  
  The origins of Vehicle Excise Duty can be traced back to the UK's Locomotives on Highways Act of 1888, which initially taxed steam-powered vehicles. The Road Traffic Act of 1920 formally introduced motor vehicle taxation, which evolved into today's VED through multiple reforms.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  随着环保意识的增强，英国政府逐步调整了车辆消费税的税率结构，以鼓励低排放车辆的普及。这一政策对汽车制造业产生了深远影响，推动了电动车和混合动力车的研发与销售。目前，VED已成为英国交通财政体系的重要组成部分。  
  With increasing environmental awareness, the UK government has gradually adjusted VED rate structures to encourage the adoption of low-emission vehicles. This policy has significantly impacted the automotive industry, driving the development and sales of electric and hybrid vehicles. Today, VED is a key component of the UK's transportation fiscal system.
