# Occurrence Policy

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：发生式保单（Occurrence Policy）是一种保险单，其保障范围基于保险事故发生的具体时间，而非索赔提出的时间。只要事故发生在保单有效期内，无论索赔何时提出，保险公司都会承担赔偿责任。这种保单通常用于责任保险，如职业责任险或产品责任险。  
  **English Explanation**: An Occurrence Policy is a type of insurance policy where coverage is based on the time when the incident occurs, rather than when the claim is made. As long as the incident happens during the policy period, the insurer will be liable for the claim, regardless of when it is filed. This type of policy is commonly used in liability insurance, such as professional liability or product liability insurance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：发生式保单广泛应用于需要长期保障的行业，如建筑、医疗和制造业。例如，建筑公司可能购买发生式保单以覆盖施工期间可能发生的意外事故。需要注意的是，由于索赔可能在多年后提出，保险公司需预留足够的准备金以应对潜在的长期负债。  
  **English Explanation**: Occurrence Policies are widely used in industries that require long-term coverage, such as construction, healthcare, and manufacturing. For instance, a construction company might purchase an Occurrence Policy to cover accidents that occur during the construction period. It’s important to note that since claims can be filed years later, insurers need to set aside sufficient reserves to handle potential long-term liabilities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：发生式保单在风险管理中具有重要意义，因为它为投保人提供了长期的安全保障。从监管角度看，这种保单要求保险公司具备强大的财务实力以应对未来可能的索赔。从投资和行业角度来看，它为高风险行业提供了稳定的保障机制，有助于行业的可持续发展。  
  **English Explanation**: Occurrence Policies are significant in risk management as they provide long-term security for policyholders. From a regulatory perspective, these policies require insurers to have strong financial capabilities to handle future claims. From an investment and industry standpoint, they offer stable protection mechanisms for high-risk industries, contributing to sustainable development.
