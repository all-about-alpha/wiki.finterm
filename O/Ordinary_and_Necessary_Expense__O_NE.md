# Ordinary and Necessary Expense (O&NE)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：普通且必要的费用（O&NE）是指在企业日常经营活动中，为维持业务正常运转而产生的合理且必需的开支。这一概念源自美国税法，用于确定哪些费用可以在计算应税收入时予以扣除。核心概念包括“普通性”（即费用在特定行业中常见）和“必要性”（即费用对业务运营不可或缺）。  
  **English Explanation**: Ordinary and Necessary Expenses (O&NE) refer to reasonable and essential costs incurred in the ordinary course of business operations to maintain normal business activities. This concept originates from U.S. tax law and is used to determine which expenses can be deducted when calculating taxable income. The core concepts include "ordinary" (i.e., the expense is common in a particular industry) and "necessary" (i.e., the expense is indispensable for business operations).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在企业财务管理中，O&NE通常包括员工工资、租金、办公用品、差旅费等。企业在申报税务时，需确保这些费用符合“普通且必要”的标准，以避免税务风险。例如，一家科技公司的研发费用可能被视为O&NE，而奢侈品的购买则不符合这一标准。  
  **English Application**: In corporate financial management, O&NE typically includes employee salaries, rent, office supplies, travel expenses, etc. When filing taxes, businesses must ensure these expenses meet the "ordinary and necessary" criteria to avoid tax risks. For example, R&D expenses for a tech company may qualify as O&NE, while the purchase of luxury items would not.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，明确O&NE的范围有助于规范企业税务申报行为，防止滥用税收优惠政策。从投资和行业角度，合理界定O&NE有助于企业优化成本结构，提升财务透明度，从而增强投资者信心。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, defining the scope of O&NE helps standardize corporate tax filing practices and prevent misuse of tax incentives. From an investment and industry standpoint, properly identifying O&NE aids businesses in optimizing cost structures and enhancing financial transparency, thereby boosting investor confidence.
