# Overleveraged

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “过度杠杆化”是指企业或个人在经营或投资中使用了过多的债务融资，导致负债水平过高，超出了其偿还能力。这一概念源于金融学中的“杠杆效应”，即通过借入资金放大收益或亏损。核心在于债务与资产或收入的比例失衡，增加了财务风险。  
  **English Explanation**: "Overleveraged" refers to a situation where a company or individual has taken on excessive debt financing in their operations or investments, leading to a debt level that exceeds their repayment capacity. This concept originates from the "leverage effect" in finance, which amplifies gains or losses through borrowed funds. The core issue is the imbalance between debt and assets or income, increasing financial risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 过度杠杆化常见于房地产、金融和制造业等资本密集型行业。例如，房地产开发商为快速扩张而大量举债，一旦市场下行，可能面临资金链断裂的风险。投资者需警惕高杠杆企业的偿债能力，尤其是在经济周期下行时。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Overleveraging is common in capital-intensive industries such as real estate, finance, and manufacturing. For instance, real estate developers may take on significant debt for rapid expansion, but a market downturn could lead to liquidity crises. Investors should be cautious about the repayment capacity of highly leveraged companies, especially during economic downturns.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，过度杠杆化可能引发系统性金融风险，如2008年全球金融危机。从投资角度看，高杠杆企业虽可能带来高回报，但也伴随高风险。从行业角度看，过度依赖债务融资可能导致企业创新能力和长期竞争力下降。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, overleveraging can trigger systemic financial risks, as seen in the 2008 global financial crisis. From an investment standpoint, highly leveraged companies may offer high returns but come with significant risks. From an industry perspective, excessive reliance on debt financing can reduce innovation capabilities and long-term competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: “过度杠杆化”的概念在20世纪80年代随着金融衍生品和债务工具的普及而逐渐形成。1997年亚洲金融危机和2008年全球金融危机中，过度杠杆化被认为是重要诱因之一。例如，雷曼兄弟的破产就是由于其过高的杠杆率导致无法应对市场波动。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of "overleveraging" emerged in the 1980s with the proliferation of financial derivatives and debt instruments. It was identified as a key factor in both the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. For example, Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy was largely due to its excessively high leverage ratio, which left it unable to withstand market volatility.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: 过度杠杆化对全球经济产生了深远影响。它加剧了金融市场的波动性，导致企业破产潮和失业率上升。目前，各国监管机构加强了对金融机构和企业杠杆率的监控，以防止类似危机的重演。
