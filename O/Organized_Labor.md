## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：有组织劳工的起源可以追溯到19世纪的工业革命时期。随着工厂制度的普及，工人面临恶劣的工作条件和低工资，促使他们联合起来争取权益。例如，英国的“宪章运动”和美国的“劳工骑士团”是早期工人组织的代表。20世纪初，国际劳工组织的成立进一步推动了全球范围内的劳工运动发展。  
  **English Origin**: The origins of organized labor can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. As factory systems spread, workers faced poor working conditions and low wages, prompting them to unite for their rights. Examples include the British "Chartist Movement" and the American "Knights of Labor." In the early 20th century, the establishment of the International Labour Organization further advanced global labor movements.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：有组织劳工对全球工业发展产生了深远影响。它推动了劳动法的制定和完善，改善了工人的生活条件和社会地位。如今，尽管工会力量在某些地区有所减弱，但它在维护工人权益方面仍发挥着重要作用。例如，北欧国家的工会覆盖率较高，其社会福利和劳动条件也相对优越。  
  **English Impact**: Organized labor has had a profound impact on global industrial development. It has driven the creation and improvement of labor laws, enhancing workers' living conditions and social status. Today, although union influence has declined in some regions, it remains crucial in protecting worker rights.
