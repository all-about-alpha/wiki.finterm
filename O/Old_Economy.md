## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：旧经济的概念起源于20世纪中后期，随着工业革命的深入和全球化的推进，传统制造业和重工业成为经济发展的主导力量。在中国，改革开放后，制造业和能源行业的快速发展奠定了旧经济的基础。21世纪初，“新经济”概念的兴起使得“旧经济”成为对比对象。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of the Old Economy emerged in the mid-to-late 20th century as traditional manufacturing and heavy industries became dominant forces in economic development following industrialization and globalization. In China, after the reform and opening-up period, rapid growth in manufacturing and energy sectors laid the foundation for the Old Economy. The rise of the "New Economy" concept in the early 21st century positioned "Old Economy" as its counterpart.
