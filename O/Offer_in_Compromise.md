# Offer in Compromise

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  妥协性清偿（Offer in Compromise，简称OIC）是指纳税人与税务机关达成的一种协议，允许纳税人以低于实际欠税金额的数额一次性清偿税务债务。这一机制通常适用于纳税人无力全额支付税款的情况，旨在帮助纳税人解决税务负担，同时确保税务机关能够收回部分税款。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the tax authority that allows the taxpayer to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed. This mechanism is typically used when the taxpayer is unable to pay the full amount, aiming to help resolve tax burdens while ensuring the tax authority recovers a portion of the debt.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  妥协性清偿主要适用于因经济困难无法全额缴纳税款的个人或企业。申请者需提供详细的财务信息，证明其无力支付全额税款。税务机关会根据申请者的财务状况、收入、资产和支出等因素决定是否接受妥协性清偿。需要注意的是，申请过程复杂且耗时，且并非所有申请都会被批准。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  An OIC is primarily applicable to individuals or businesses facing financial hardship and unable to pay their full tax liability. Applicants must provide detailed financial information to demonstrate their inability to pay. The tax authority evaluates factors such as income, assets, and expenses to determine whether to accept the offer. It’s important to note that the application process is complex and time-consuming, and not all applications are approved.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  妥协性清偿在税务管理中具有重要意义。它为纳税人提供了一种解决税务债务的途径，避免了因长期欠税导致的更严重后果（如资产查封或信用受损）。同时，它也帮助税务机关收回部分税款，减少坏账损失。从行业角度来看，这一机制有助于维护税收公平性和社会稳定。  
  **English Significance**：  
  The OIC plays a crucial role in tax administration. It provides taxpayers with a pathway to resolve tax debts, avoiding severe consequences such as asset seizure or credit damage due to prolonged unpaid taxes. Simultaneously, it helps tax authorities recover a portion of the debt, reducing bad debt losses. From an industry perspective, this mechanism supports fairness in taxation and social stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  妥协性清偿的概念最早可追溯到美国《国内税收法典》（Internal Revenue Code）的制定时期。20世纪初，随着税收制度的完善和纳税人权益保护意识的增强，美国国税局（IRS）开始引入这一机制，以应对日益复杂的税务纠纷和纳税人的经济困境。1998年，《纳税人权利法案》（Taxpayer Bill of Rights）进一步明确了妥协性清偿的法律地位和操作流程。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of an Offer in Compromise dates back to the establishment of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In the early 20th century, as tax systems evolved and awareness of taxpayer rights grew, the IRS introduced this mechanism to address increasingly complex tax disputes and taxpayers' financial hardships. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights in 1998 further solidified its legal status and operational procedures.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  妥协性清偿的实施对税务行业产生了深远影响。它不仅为纳税人提供了灵活的解决方案，还促进了税务机关与纳税人之间的沟通与合作。目前，这一机制已被许多国家借鉴并纳入其税收管理体系，成为全球税务管理的重要组成部分。在中国，《税收征管法》也引入了类似的规定，以帮助企业和个人解决税务问题。  
  **English Impact**：  
  The implementation of OIC has had a profound impact on the tax industry. It not only provides taxpayers with flexible solutions but also fosters communication and cooperation between tax authorities and taxpayers. Today, this mechanism has been adopted by many countries as part of their tax administration systems, becoming a key component of global tax management. In China, similar provisions have been introduced under the Tax Collection Administration Law to assist businesses and individuals in resolving tax issues.
