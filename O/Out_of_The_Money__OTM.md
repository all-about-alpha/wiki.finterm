# Out of The Money (OTM)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “价外期权”（Out of The Money, OTM）是指期权的行权价格与标的资产当前市场价格相比，不具备内在价值的期权。对于看涨期权（Call Option），当标的资产的市场价格低于行权价格时，该期权为价外期权；对于看跌期权（Put Option），当标的资产的市场价格高于行权价格时，该期权为价外期权。价外期权的持有者通常不会选择行权，因为行权会导致亏损。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  "Out of The Money" (OTM) refers to an option that has no intrinsic value because its strike price is not favorable compared to the current market price of the underlying asset. For a call option, it is OTM when the market price of the underlying asset is below the strike price; for a put option, it is OTM when the market price is above the strike price. Holders of OTM options typically do not exercise them, as doing so would result in a loss.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：  
  价外期权常用于投机或对冲策略中。由于价外期权的权利金较低，投资者可能购买它们以期待市场大幅波动带来的潜在收益。然而，价外期权的风险较高，因为其到期时可能一文不值。在风险管理中，投资者需谨慎评估市场走势和波动性。  
  **English Application**：  
  OTM options are often used in speculative or hedging strategies. Due to their lower premiums, investors may purchase them in anticipation of significant market movements that could yield potential profits. However, OTM options carry higher risks, as they may expire worthless. In risk management, investors must carefully assess market trends and volatility.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从投资和监管角度来看，价外期权的存在丰富了金融市场的产品结构，为投资者提供了更多灵活的策略选择。同时，监管机构需关注其潜在的高风险特性，确保市场稳定和投资者保护。在行业层面，价外期权的交易活跃度反映了市场对未来波动的预期。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From an investment and regulatory perspective, OTM options enrich the product structure of financial markets, offering investors more flexible strategic choices. Meanwhile, regulators must monitor their high-risk nature to ensure market stability and investor protection. At the industry level, the trading activity of OTM options reflects market expectations for future volatility.
