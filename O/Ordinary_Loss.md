# Ordinary Loss

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：普通损失（Ordinary Loss）是指企业在日常经营活动中产生的、与主营业务相关的亏损。这类损失通常可以全额抵扣应税收入，从而减少企业的税负。普通损失与资本损失（Capital Loss）不同，后者通常与资产出售或投资相关，且抵扣额度有限。  
  **English Explanation**: An ordinary loss refers to a loss incurred by a business in its regular operations, directly related to its primary business activities. Such losses are typically fully deductible against taxable income, thereby reducing the company's tax liability. Ordinary losses differ from capital losses, which are usually associated with the sale of assets or investments and have limited deductibility.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：普通损失常见于企业因经营不善、市场波动或不可抗力因素导致的亏损。例如，制造业企业因原材料成本上升而导致的利润下降，或零售企业因销售额下滑而产生的亏损。需要注意的是，普通损失的认定需符合税法规定，且需提供充分的财务凭证。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Ordinary losses often occur due to poor management, market fluctuations, or unforeseen events. For example, a manufacturing company may experience a loss due to rising raw material costs, or a retail business may incur losses from declining sales. It is important to note that the recognition of ordinary losses must comply with tax regulations and be supported by adequate financial documentation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从税务角度来看，普通损失能够有效降低企业的应税收入，从而减轻税负。对于投资者而言，了解企业的普通损失情况有助于评估其经营风险和财务健康状况。从行业监管角度，普通损失的合理认定和抵扣有助于维护税收公平性和市场秩序。  
  **English Significance**: From a tax perspective, ordinary losses can significantly reduce taxable income, thereby lowering tax liabilities. For investors, understanding a company's ordinary losses helps assess its operational risks and financial health. From a regulatory standpoint, the proper recognition and deduction of ordinary losses contribute to maintaining tax fairness and market order.
