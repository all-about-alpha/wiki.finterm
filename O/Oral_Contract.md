# Oral Contract

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：口头合同是指双方当事人通过口头协商达成一致，而未以书面形式记录的合同。其核心概念在于双方的意思表示一致，且不依赖于书面形式。  
  **English Explanation**: An oral contract is an agreement between parties that is made verbally without being recorded in writing. The core concept lies in the mutual consent of the parties, independent of written documentation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：口头合同常用于日常交易或小额交易中，如购买商品或服务。然而，由于其缺乏书面证据，容易引发争议，特别是在涉及大额交易或复杂条款时。因此，法律通常要求某些类型的合同必须以书面形式订立。  
  **English Explanation**: Oral contracts are commonly used in everyday transactions or small-scale deals, such as purchasing goods or services. However, due to the lack of written evidence, they are prone to disputes, especially in large transactions or complex terms. Therefore, the law often requires certain types of contracts to be in writing.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从法律和投资角度来看，口头合同的效力受到限制，因其难以证明和追溯。在商业实践中，书面合同被视为更可靠的法律依据。尽管如此，口头合同在某些情境下仍具有灵活性优势。  
  **English Explanation**: From a legal and investment perspective, the enforceability of oral contracts is limited due to difficulties in proving and tracing them. In business practice, written contracts are considered more reliable legal evidence. Nevertheless, oral contracts still offer flexibility advantages in certain situations.
