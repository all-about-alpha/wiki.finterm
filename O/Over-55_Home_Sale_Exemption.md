## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  该政策最早于1964年由美国国会提出，旨在通过税收优惠鼓励老年人出售房产，以应对退休后的生活需求。随着时间的推移，该政策经历了多次修订，包括豁免金额的调整和适用条件的细化。1997年，美国税法进行了重大改革，引入了更为广泛的“主要居所销售豁免”政策，取代了原有的“55岁以上房屋销售豁免”，但后者在历史上仍具有重要意义。  
  **English Origin**：  
  This policy was first introduced by the U.S. Congress in 1964 to encourage seniors to sell their homes through tax benefits to meet post-retirement needs. Over time, the policy underwent several revisions, including adjustments to the exemption amount and refinements to eligibility criteria. In 1997, a major tax reform introduced the broader "Primary Residence Sale Exemption," which replaced the original "Over-55 Home Sale Exemption," though the latter remains historically significant.
