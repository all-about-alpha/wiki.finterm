# Overbought

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：超买（Overbought）是一个技术分析术语，指某种资产的价格在短期内上涨过快、过高，导致其价格可能已经偏离了其内在价值。通常通过技术指标如相对强弱指数（RSI）来判断，当RSI超过70时，被认为处于超买状态。  
  **English Explanation**: Overbought is a technical analysis term indicating that the price of an asset has risen too rapidly and excessively in the short term, potentially deviating from its intrinsic value. It is often identified using technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), where an RSI above 70 suggests an overbought condition.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：超买状态常被投资者用于判断市场是否可能出现回调或反转。例如，当某只股票的RSI超过70时，投资者可能会选择卖出或减少持仓，以避免价格下跌的风险。然而，超买并不一定意味着价格会立即下跌，市场情绪和基本面因素也可能继续推动价格上涨。  
  **English Explanation**: The overbought condition is often used by investors to gauge potential market corrections or reversals. For instance, when a stock's RSI exceeds 70, investors might consider selling or reducing their positions to avoid potential price declines. However, overbought does not necessarily mean an immediate price drop, as market sentiment and fundamental factors can continue to drive prices higher.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：超买状态在投资决策中具有重要意义，尤其是在短线交易和技术分析中。它帮助投资者识别潜在的市场风险，避免在高位追涨。同时，监管机构也会关注市场中的超买现象，以防止过度投机和市场泡沫的形成。  
  **English Explanation**: The overbought condition holds significant importance in investment decisions, particularly in short-term trading and technical analysis. It helps investors identify potential market risks and avoid chasing prices at high levels. Additionally, regulators monitor overbought conditions to prevent excessive speculation and the formation of market bubbles.
