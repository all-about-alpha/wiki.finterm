# Over-the-Counter (OTC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：场外交易（Over-the-Counter，简称OTC）是指在证券交易所之外进行的金融工具交易。这种交易方式通常通过经纪商或交易商网络进行，而不是在集中化的交易所内完成。OTC市场包括股票、债券、衍生品、外汇等金融产品的交易。  
  **English Explanation**: Over-the-Counter (OTC) refers to the trading of financial instruments outside of formal exchanges. This type of transaction typically occurs through a network of brokers or dealers rather than on a centralized exchange. OTC markets include trading of stocks, bonds, derivatives, foreign exchange, and other financial products.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：OTC交易广泛应用于中小企业股票、未上市证券、衍生品（如期权、掉期）以及外汇市场。由于OTC市场缺乏集中监管，交易双方需自行承担信用风险，因此投资者需谨慎评估交易对手的信用状况。  
  **English Explanation**: OTC trading is widely used for small and medium-sized enterprise stocks, unlisted securities, derivatives (such as options and swaps), and the foreign exchange market. Due to the lack of centralized regulation in OTC markets, parties involved must bear counterparty credit risks, requiring investors to carefully assess the creditworthiness of their trading partners.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：OTC市场为无法满足上市条件的企业提供了融资渠道，同时也为投资者提供了更多元化的投资选择。然而，由于其透明度较低，监管机构需加强对OTC市场的监督，以防范系统性风险。  
  **English Explanation**: OTC markets provide financing channels for companies that cannot meet listing requirements and offer investors more diversified investment options. However, due to their lower transparency, regulatory bodies need to strengthen oversight of OTC markets to prevent systemic risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：OTC交易的历史可以追溯到18世纪的欧洲，当时商人通过非正式网络进行证券交易。19世纪末，随着美国经济的快速发展，OTC市场逐渐形成，并在20世纪中期成为全球金融市场的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: The history of OTC trading dates back to 18th-century Europe, where merchants traded securities through informal networks. By the late 19th century, with the rapid economic growth in the United States, OTC markets gradually formed and became a significant part of the global financial system by the mid-20th century.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：OTC市场的发展极大地促进了金融创新和资本流动，但也曾因缺乏监管而引发金融危机（如2008年次贷危机）。目前，全球OTC市场规模庞大，已成为金融体系中不可或缺的一部分。  
  **English Explanation**: The development of OTC markets has significantly promoted financial innovation and capital flows but has also triggered financial crises (e.g., the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis) due to insufficient regulation. Today, the global OTC market is vast and has become an indispensable part of the financial system.
