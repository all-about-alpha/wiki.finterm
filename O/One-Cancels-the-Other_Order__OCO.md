# One-Cancels-the-Other Order (OCO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：一单取消另一单（One-Cancels-the-Other Order，简称OCO）是一种高级交易指令，允许投资者同时设置两个条件订单，当其中一个订单被执行时，另一个订单将自动取消。这种指令通常用于管理风险和锁定利润，常见于外汇、股票和期货市场。  
  **English Explanation**: A One-Cancels-the-Other Order (OCO) is an advanced trading instruction that allows investors to place two conditional orders simultaneously, where the execution of one order automatically cancels the other. This type of order is commonly used for risk management and profit locking, frequently seen in forex, stock, and futures markets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：OCO指令常用于投资者在不确定市场方向时，同时设置止损和止盈订单。例如，在买入某股票后，投资者可以设置一个止损订单以限制潜在亏损，同时设置一个止盈订单以锁定利润。当市场价格触及其中一个订单时，另一个订单将自动取消。需要注意的是，OCO指令的执行依赖于市场流动性，可能在极端市场条件下无法完全按预期执行。  
  **English Application**: OCO orders are often used by investors when the market direction is uncertain, allowing them to set both a stop-loss and a take-profit order simultaneously. For example, after purchasing a stock, an investor can set a stop-loss order to limit potential losses and a take-profit order to lock in profits. When the market price triggers one of these orders, the other is automatically canceled. It’s important to note that the execution of OCO orders depends on market liquidity and may not fully perform as expected under extreme market conditions.
