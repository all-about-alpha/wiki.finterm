# Off-the-Run Treasuries

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 非活跃国债（Off-the-Run Treasuries）是指那些已经发行但不再是最新发行的美国国债。它们通常比最新发行的国债（即活跃国债，On-the-Run Treasuries）流动性较低，交易量较小。非活跃国债的收益率通常略高于活跃国债，以补偿其较低的流动性。  
  **English Explanation**: Off-the-Run Treasuries refer to U.S. Treasury securities that have been issued but are no longer the most recently issued. They generally have lower liquidity and trading volume compared to the most recently issued Treasuries, known as On-the-Run Treasuries. The yield on Off-the-Run Treasuries is typically slightly higher than that of On-the-Run Treasuries to compensate for their lower liquidity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 非活跃国债常用于长期投资组合中，尤其是在投资者寻求相对稳定收益且对流动性要求不高的情况下。由于其流动性较低，投资者在交易时需注意市场深度和价格波动风险。此外，非活跃国债也用于套利策略和对冲操作。  
  **English Explanation**: Off-the-Run Treasuries are often used in long-term investment portfolios, particularly when investors seek relatively stable returns and do not require high liquidity. Due to their lower liquidity, investors need to be cautious about market depth and price volatility when trading. Additionally, Off-the-Run Treasuries are utilized in arbitrage strategies and hedging operations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 非活跃国债的概念起源于美国国债市场的自然演变过程。随着新债券的不断发行，旧债券逐渐退出市场主流交易范围，成为非活跃债券。这一现象在20世纪70年代随着美国国债市场的快速发展而变得更加明显。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Off-the-Run Treasories originated from the natural evolution of the U.S. Treasury market. As new bonds are continuously issued, older bonds gradually fall out of mainstream trading activity, becoming off-the-run securities. This phenomenon became more pronounced in the 1970s with the rapid development of the U.S. Treasury market.
