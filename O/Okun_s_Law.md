# Okun's Law

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **奥肯定律**是由美国经济学家阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun）于1962年提出的一种经济学理论，描述了失业率与经济增长率之间的反向关系。其核心概念是，当经济增长率高于潜在增长率时，失业率会下降；反之，当经济增长率低于潜在增长率时，失业率会上升。  
  **Okun's Law** is an economic theory proposed by American economist Arthur Okun in 1962, which describes the inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the economic growth rate. The core concept is that when the economic growth rate exceeds the potential growth rate, the unemployment rate decreases; conversely, when the economic growth rate falls below the potential growth rate, the unemployment rate increases.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在宏观经济政策制定中，奥肯定律被广泛用于预测失业率变化和评估经济刺激政策的效果。例如，政府可以通过观察GDP增长率来预估失业率的变动趋势，从而调整财政或货币政策。需要注意的是，该定律在不同国家或经济环境下可能存在差异。  
  In macroeconomic policy-making, Okun's Law is widely used to predict changes in unemployment rates and evaluate the effectiveness of economic stimulus policies. For example, governments can estimate trends in unemployment by observing GDP growth rates and adjust fiscal or monetary policies accordingly. It should be noted that this law may vary across different countries or economic environments.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，奥肯定律为理解经济周期和劳动力市场动态提供了重要工具。它帮助政策制定者平衡经济增长与就业目标，同时也为投资者和企业提供了预测经济走势的参考依据。  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Okun's Law provides an important tool for understanding economic cycles and labor market dynamics. It helps policymakers balance economic growth and employment goals while also offering investors and businesses a reference for predicting economic trends.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  奥肯定律的提出源于20世纪60年代美国的经济研究。阿瑟·奥肯在分析美国战后经济数据时发现，GDP增长率与失业率之间存在稳定的反向关系。这一发现最初基于对美国经济的实证研究，后来被广泛应用于全球其他经济体。  
  The origin of Okun's Law dates back to economic research in the United States during the 1960s. Arthur Okun discovered a stable inverse relationship between GDP growth rates and unemployment rates while analyzing post-war U.S. economic data. This finding was initially based on empirical research on the U.S. economy and was later widely applied to other global economies.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  奥肯定律对宏观经济理论和政策实践产生了深远影响。它不仅成为经济学教科书中的经典理论之一，还被各国政府和国际组织用于制定经济政策。尽管其具体参数可能因国家和时期而异，但其核心思想在全球范围内得到了广泛认可和应用。  
  Okun's Law has had a profound impact on macroeconomic theory and policy practice. It has become one of the classic theories in economics textbooks and is used by governments and international organizations to formulate economic policies. Although its specific parameters may vary by country and period, its core idea has been widely recognized and applied globally.
