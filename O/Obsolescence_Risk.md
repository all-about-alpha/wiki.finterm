# Obsolescence Risk

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：过时风险（Obsolescence Risk）是指由于技术进步、市场需求变化或产品更新换代，导致资产、技术或产品在未达到预期使用寿命前就失去价值或变得不再适用的风险。这一概念最早由经济学家在研究技术生命周期时提出，核心在于资产或技术的价值随时间推移而贬值的可能性。  
  **English Explanation**: Obsolescence risk refers to the risk that an asset, technology, or product loses its value or becomes obsolete before reaching its expected useful life due to technological advancements, changes in market demand, or product upgrades. This concept was initially introduced by economists studying the lifecycle of technology, with its core focus on the potential depreciation of assets or technologies over time.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：过时风险在科技、制造业和消费品行业中尤为显著。例如，电子产品制造商面临因新技术的快速迭代而导致现有产品迅速过时的风险。投资者在评估企业价值时，也需考虑其产品或技术是否容易被市场淘汰。风险管理策略包括持续创新、多元化投资以及缩短产品生命周期等。  
  **English Application**: Obsolescence risk is particularly prominent in industries such as technology, manufacturing, and consumer goods. For instance, electronics manufacturers face the risk of their current products becoming obsolete quickly due to rapid technological advancements. Investors must also consider whether a company’s products or technologies are susceptible to market obsolescence when evaluating its value. Risk management strategies include continuous innovation, diversified investments, and shortening product lifecycles.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，过时风险影响企业的财务稳定性和可持续性；从投资角度看，它是评估企业长期竞争力的关键因素；从行业角度看，它推动企业不断创新以保持市场竞争力。忽视过时风险可能导致资产贬值、市场份额流失甚至企业破产。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, obsolescence risk impacts a company’s financial stability and sustainability; from an investment perspective, it is a critical factor in assessing long-term competitiveness; from an industry perspective, it drives companies to innovate continuously to maintain market relevance. Ignoring obsolescence risk can lead to asset depreciation, loss of market share, or even business failure.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：过时风险的概念可追溯到20世纪初的工业革命时期，当时技术的快速进步使得许多传统工艺和设备迅速被淘汰。经济学家约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）在其“创造性破坏”理论中首次系统性地阐述了技术更新对经济的影响，为过时风险的研究奠定了基础。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of obsolescence risk dates back to the early 20th century during the Industrial Revolution when rapid technological advancements rendered many traditional crafts and equipment obsolete. Economist Joseph Schumpeter first systematically explained the impact of technological renewal on the economy in his theory of “creative destruction,” laying the foundation for research on obsolescence risk.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：过时风险对全球各行业产生了深远影响。例如，数码相机的普及导致传统胶片相机市场急剧萎缩；智能手机的兴起使得功能手机逐渐退出市场。当前，随着人工智能和物联网等新兴技术的发展，更多行业面临过时风险的挑战。  
  **English Impact**: Obsolescence risk has had a profound impact on industries worldwide. For example, the popularity of digital cameras led to a sharp decline in the traditional film camera market; the rise of smartphones gradually phased out feature phones. Currently, with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), more industries are facing challenges related to obsolescence risk.
