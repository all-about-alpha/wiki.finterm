* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 普通年金常用于养老金计划、分期付款贷款和保险产品中。例如，退休人员每月领取的养老金就是一种普通年金。需要注意的是，由于支付发生在期末，其现值计算与期初支付的年金（即即付年金）不同，投资者需根据自身需求选择合适的年金类型。  
  **English Explanation**: Ordinary annuities are commonly used in pension plans, installment loans, and insurance products. For example, monthly pension payments received by retirees are a form of ordinary annuity.

Investors should choose the appropriate annuity type based on their needs.
