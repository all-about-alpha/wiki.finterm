# Overfunded Pension Plan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：超额养老金计划（Overfunded Pension Plan）是指企业或机构的养老金计划资产超过其未来需要支付的养老金负债的情况。这意味着养老金计划的资金充足，能够覆盖所有预期的未来支付义务，甚至还有盈余。超额养老金计划通常是由于投资回报高于预期或缴费金额超过实际需求所致。  
  **English Explanation**: An overfunded pension plan refers to a situation where the assets of a pension plan exceed the liabilities required to cover future pension payments. This indicates that the plan has sufficient funds to meet all anticipated future obligations, with a surplus remaining. Overfunding typically results from higher-than-expected investment returns or contributions exceeding actual needs.
