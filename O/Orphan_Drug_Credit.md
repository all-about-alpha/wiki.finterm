# Orphan Drug Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 孤儿药税收抵免（Orphan Drug Credit）是美国政府为鼓励制药公司研发治疗罕见病的药物而设立的一项税收优惠政策。该政策允许制药公司在研发孤儿药时，享受一定比例的研发费用税收抵免。孤儿药是指用于治疗患病人数少于20万人的罕见病的药物。  
  **English Explanation**: The Orphan Drug Credit is a tax incentive established by the U.S. government to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for rare diseases. This policy allows companies to claim a percentage of their research and development (R&D) expenses as a tax credit when developing orphan drugs. Orphan drugs are defined as medications intended to treat rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 孤儿药税收抵免主要应用于制药企业在研发罕见病药物时的成本分摊。通过这一政策，企业可以降低研发成本，提高投资回报率，从而激励更多企业进入罕见病药物市场。需要注意的是，企业需满足特定条件才能申请该抵免，如获得美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）的孤儿药认定。  
  **English Explanation**: The Orphan Drug Credit is primarily applied by pharmaceutical companies to offset the costs associated with developing drugs for rare diseases. This policy helps reduce R&D expenses and improve return on investment, thereby incentivizing more companies to enter the rare disease drug market. It is important to note that companies must meet specific criteria, such as obtaining orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to qualify for this credit.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，孤儿药税收抵免有助于推动罕见病药物的研发，填补医疗空白；从投资角度看，它降低了企业的财务风险，吸引了更多资本进入该领域；从行业角度看，它促进了生物医药产业的创新和发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the Orphan Drug Credit promotes the development of treatments for rare diseases, addressing unmet medical needs. From an investment standpoint, it reduces financial risks for companies, attracting more capital into this sector. From an industry perspective, it fosters innovation and growth within the biopharmaceutical sector.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 孤儿药税收抵免起源于1983年通过的《孤儿药法案》（Orphan Drug Act）。该法案由美国国会制定，旨在解决罕见病药物研发动力不足的问题。法案的推动者包括患者权益组织、医学专家和立法者，他们共同呼吁为罕见病患者提供更多治疗选择。  
  **English Explanation**: The Orphan Drug Credit originated from the Orphan Drug Act passed in 1983.
