# One-Time Charge

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **一次性费用** 是指企业在特定期间内发生的非经常性、非重复性的支出或损失。这类费用通常与企业的日常经营活动无关，而是由特殊事件或决策引起，如资产减值、重组成本、法律诉讼和解等。  
  **One-Time Charge** refers to a non-recurring, non-repetitive expense or loss incurred by a company during a specific period. These charges are typically unrelated to the company's regular operations and are caused by special events or decisions, such as asset impairments, restructuring costs, or legal settlements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在企业财务报表中，一次性费用通常被单独列示，以便投资者和分析师能够更准确地评估企业的核心盈利能力。例如，某公司因出售子公司而产生的一次性损失，不应被视为其持续经营能力的反映。需要注意的是，一次性费用可能对短期财务表现产生重大影响，但不应被过度解读为长期趋势的指标。  
  In corporate financial statements, one-time charges are often presented separately to allow investors and analysts to more accurately assess the company's core profitability. For example, a one-time loss from the sale of a subsidiary should not be interpreted as a reflection of the company's ongoing operational capabilities. It is important to note that one-time charges can significantly impact short-term financial performance but should not be overinterpreted as indicators of long-term trends.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，明确区分一次性费用和经常性费用有助于提高财务信息的透明度和可比性。对于投资者而言，识别一次性费用有助于更准确地评估企业的真实盈利能力和估值水平。在行业分析中，排除一次性费用的影响可以更清晰地反映企业的经营效率和竞争力。  
  From a regulatory perspective, clearly distinguishing between one-time charges and recurring expenses enhances the transparency and comparability of financial information. For investors, identifying one-time charges helps in more accurately assessing a company's true profitability and valuation. In industry analysis, excluding the impact of one-time charges provides a clearer picture of a company's operational efficiency and competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  一次性费用的概念最早出现在20世纪中期的美国会计准则中，当时企业开始面临越来越多的非经常性支出和损失。随着全球化和企业复杂性的增加，这一概念逐渐被国际会计准则采纳并完善。2001年安然事件后，监管机构进一步强调了对一次性费用的披露要求，以防止财务欺诈和误导性陈述。  
  The concept of one-time charges first appeared in U.S. accounting standards in the mid-20th century when companies began facing increasing non-recurring expenses and losses. With globalization and growing corporate complexity, this concept was gradually adopted and refined by international accounting standards. After the Enron scandal in 2001, regulators further emphasized disclosure requirements for one-time charges to prevent financial fraud and misleading statements.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  一次性费用的引入和规范对全球财务报告体系产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了财务报表的透明度，还帮助投资者更好地理解企业的财务状况和经营成果。如今，大多数国家和地区的会计准则都要求企业明确披露一次性费用及其影响范围。这一做法已成为全球财务报告的重要标准之一。  
  The introduction and standardization of one-time charges have had a profound impact on global financial reporting systems. It has not only enhanced the transparency of financial statements but also helped investors better understand companies' financial conditions and operating results. Today, accounting standards in most countries and regions require companies to clearly disclose one-time charges and their scope of impact. This practice has become an important standard in global financial reporting.
