# Oversold

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：超卖（Oversold）是一个技术分析术语，指某种资产（如股票、债券或商品）的价格在短期内大幅下跌，导致其价格低于其内在价值或市场平均水平。通常，超卖状态通过技术指标如相对强弱指数（RSI）来识别，当RSI低于30时，通常被认为是超卖信号。  
  **English Explanation**: Oversold is a technical analysis term referring to a situation where the price of an asset (such as a stock, bond, or commodity) has fallen significantly in a short period, causing it to trade below its intrinsic value or market average. The oversold condition is often identified using technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), where an RSI below 30 is typically considered an oversold signal.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：超卖状态常被投资者视为买入机会，因为价格可能已经过度下跌，存在反弹的可能性。然而，投资者需谨慎，因为超卖并不一定意味着价格会立即回升，市场情绪或基本面因素可能导致价格继续下跌。常见的应用场景包括股票、外汇和加密货币市场。  
  **English Application**: An oversold condition is often seen by investors as a buying opportunity, as the price may have fallen excessively and could rebound. However, investors should exercise caution, as oversold does not necessarily mean the price will recover immediately; market sentiment or fundamental factors may cause the price to continue falling. Common application scenarios include the stock, forex, and cryptocurrency markets.

  **中文重要性**：超卖概念在投资决策中具有重要意义，尤其是在技术分析领域。它帮助投资者识别潜在的市场反转点，从而制定买入策略。从监管角度看，超卖现象也可能引发市场波动，需引起监管机构的关注。  
  **English Significance**: The concept of oversold is significant in investment decision-making, particularly in technical analysis. It helps investors identify potential market reversal points and formulate buying strategies. From a regulatory perspective, oversold conditions may also trigger market volatility, requiring attention from regulatory bodies.
