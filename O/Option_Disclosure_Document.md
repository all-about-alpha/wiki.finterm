## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  期权披露文件的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代美国金融市场的快速发展期。随着期权交易的普及，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）和商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）开始要求发行机构提供详细的风险披露文件，以保护投资者利益。这一制度随后被全球多个金融市场采纳。  
  The origin of the Option Disclosure Document can be traced back to the rapid development of U.S. financial markets in the 1970s. With the increasing popularity of option trading, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began requiring issuers to provide detailed risk disclosure documents to protect investor interests. This system was subsequently adopted by multiple global financial markets.

  在中国，随着金融衍生品市场的逐步开放和成熟，期权披露文件的引入显著提升了投资者的风险意识和市场参与度。目前，该文件已成为中国金融市场标准化操作的一部分，为市场的健康发展提供了保障。在全球范围内，这一制度也促进了国际金融市场的规范化和透明度提升。  
  In China, with the gradual opening and maturation of financial derivatives markets, the introduction of Option Disclosure Documents has significantly enhanced investor risk awareness and market participation.
