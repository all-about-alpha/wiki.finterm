# Over-Limit Fee

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：超限费（Over-Limit Fee）是指当信用卡持卡人的消费金额超过其信用额度时，银行或发卡机构向持卡人收取的一种费用。该费用的目的是为了补偿银行因持卡人超额使用信用额度而可能产生的额外风险和管理成本。  
  **English Explanation**: An Over-Limit Fee is a charge imposed by a bank or credit card issuer when a cardholder's spending exceeds their credit limit. This fee is designed to compensate the bank for the additional risk and administrative costs associated with the cardholder's over-limit usage.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：超限费通常适用于信用卡用户，尤其是在用户未设置消费提醒或未及时还款的情况下。银行可能会在用户超额消费后立即收取该费用，或在下一个账单周期中体现。持卡人应注意避免超额消费，以免产生额外费用。  
  **English Explanation**: Over-Limit Fees are typically applied to credit card users, especially those who do not set spending alerts or fail to make timely payments. The bank may charge this fee immediately after the over-limit transaction or include it in the next billing cycle. Cardholders should be cautious to avoid exceeding their credit limits to prevent additional charges.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，超限费是银行风险管理的一部分，旨在控制持卡人的过度消费行为。从投资和行业角度看，超限费为银行提供了额外的收入来源，但也可能引发消费者对不公平收费的投诉。因此，银行需要在收取超限费和维护客户关系之间找到平衡。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Over-Limit Fees are part of a bank's risk management strategy to control excessive spending by cardholders. From an investment and industry standpoint, these fees provide an additional revenue stream for banks but may also lead to consumer complaints about unfair charges. Therefore, banks must balance the imposition of Over-Limit Fees with maintaining positive customer relationships.
