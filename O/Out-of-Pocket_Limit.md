# Out-of-Pocket Limit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 自付限额（Out-of-Pocket Limit）是指在医疗保险中，被保险人在一个保险年度内需要自行承担的最高医疗费用金额。一旦达到这个限额，保险公司将承担剩余的全部医疗费用。这一概念旨在保护被保险人免受高额医疗费用的负担。  
  **English Explanation**: The Out-of-Pocket Limit refers to the maximum amount of medical expenses that an insured individual is required to pay within a policy year under a health insurance plan. Once this limit is reached, the insurance company covers all remaining medical costs. This concept is designed to protect the insured from excessive financial burdens due to high medical expenses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 自付限额通常适用于医疗保险中的共付额、免赔额和共同保险部分。例如，如果某人的自付限额为5000元，那么在这一年内，他只需支付不超过5000元的医疗费用，超出部分由保险公司承担。需要注意的是，某些费用如非网络医院的治疗费用可能不计入自付限额。  
  **English Application**: The Out-of-Pocket Limit typically applies to copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance in health insurance plans. For instance, if an individual's out-of-pocket limit is $5,000, they will only need to pay up to $5,000 in medical expenses for the year, with the insurance company covering any additional costs. It's important to note that certain expenses, such as out-of-network treatments, may not count towards this limit.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 自付限额在医疗保险中具有重要的财务保护作用，特别是在面对重大疾病或长期治疗时。它帮助被保险人避免因高额医疗费用而陷入财务困境。从监管角度来看，许多国家和地区的医疗保险法规都规定了自付限额的上限，以保障消费者的权益。
