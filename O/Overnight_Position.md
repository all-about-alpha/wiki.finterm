# Overnight Position

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **隔夜头寸** 是指在金融市场中，投资者在交易日结束时仍持有的未平仓头寸，这些头寸将延续到下一个交易日。隔夜头寸通常涉及股票、外汇、期货等金融工具，投资者需要承担隔夜风险，如价格波动和利息成本。  
  **Overnight Position** refers to an open position in financial markets that an investor holds at the end of a trading day and carries over to the next trading day. It typically involves financial instruments such as stocks, forex, and futures, exposing investors to overnight risks like price fluctuations and interest costs.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文应用场景中，隔夜头寸常见于外汇交易和期货市场。投资者通过持有隔夜头寸来捕捉市场趋势或对冲风险，但需注意隔夜利息（掉期点）和市场波动带来的潜在损失。例如，在外汇交易中，持有高息货币的隔夜头寸可能获得利息收益，而低息货币则可能产生利息成本。  
  In English application scenarios, overnight positions are common in forex and futures markets. Investors use them to capture market trends or hedge risks but must be aware of potential losses from overnight interest (swap points) and market volatility. For instance, in forex trading, holding an overnight position in a high-interest currency may yield interest income, while a low-interest currency may incur interest costs.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从中文视角看，隔夜头寸在投资策略中具有重要意义。它允许投资者利用市场趋势延长获利机会，但也增加了风险管理难度。监管机构对隔夜头寸的关注主要集中在杠杆使用和风险控制上，以防止市场过度波动。

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  隔夜头寸的概念起源于20世纪初的期货市场。随着全球金融市场的扩展和24小时交易的出现，外汇市场也开始广泛应用这一概念。20世纪70年代布雷顿森林体系崩溃后，浮动汇率制度的确立进一步推动了隔夜头寸的发展。  
  The concept of overnight positions originated in the early 20th century within futures markets. With the expansion of global financial markets and the advent of 24-hour trading, it became widely used in forex markets. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s and the establishment of floating exchange rates further propelled its development.
