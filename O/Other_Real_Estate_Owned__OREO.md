  **中文起源**：OREO的概念起源于20世纪80年代的美国储蓄和贷款危机（S&L Crisis），当时大量房地产贷款违约导致金融机构持有大量非自用房产。为应对这一现象，监管机构引入了OREO这一分类，以帮助金融机构更好地管理这些不良资产。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of OREO originated during the U.S. Savings and Loan Crisis (S&L Crisis) in the 1980s when a large number of real estate loan defaults led financial institutions to hold significant amounts of non-operating properties.
