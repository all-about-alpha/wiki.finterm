  **中文解释**：三分之一法则（One-Third Rule）是一种投资或资源分配策略，建议将总资金或资源的三分之一用于高风险投资，三分之一用于中等风险投资，剩余三分之一用于低风险投资。这一法则旨在通过分散投资来平衡风险和收益。  
  **English Explanation**: The One-Third Rule is an investment or resource allocation strategy that suggests allocating one-third of total funds or resources to high-risk investments, one-third to medium-risk investments, and the remaining one-third to low-risk investments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：三分之一法则常用于个人理财、企业资金管理和项目预算分配。例如，个人投资者可以将资金分为三部分：一部分投入股票市场（高风险），一部分投入债券（中等风险），另一部分存入银行（低风险）。需要注意的是，该法则并非适用于所有情况，投资者应根据自身风险承受能力和市场环境灵活调整。  
  **English Explanation**: The One-Third Rule is commonly applied in personal finance, corporate fund management, and project budget allocation. For instance, an individual investor might divide their funds into three parts: one part invested in the stock market (high risk), one part in bonds (medium risk), and the remaining part in a bank deposit (low risk). It’s important to note that this rule is not universally applicable; investors should adjust it based on their risk tolerance and market conditions.
