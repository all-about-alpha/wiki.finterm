# Odd Lot Theory

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：零股理论（Odd Lot Theory）是一种投资策略，认为小额投资者（即购买零股的投资者）的行为通常与市场趋势相反，因此可以作为反向指标。该理论由美国投资分析师加菲尔德·德鲁（Garfield Drew）在20世纪中期提出，核心概念是通过观察零股交易者的行为来预测市场走势。  
  **English Explanation**: The Odd Lot Theory is an investment strategy that suggests the behavior of small investors (those who buy odd lots) typically runs counter to market trends, thus serving as a contrarian indicator. The theory was proposed by American investment analyst Garfield Drew in the mid-20th century, with the core concept being to predict market movements by observing the actions of odd lot traders.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：零股理论主要应用于股票市场分析，特别是在市场情绪极端化时。例如，当零股交易者大量买入某只股票时，可能预示着市场即将下跌；反之，当他们大量卖出时，可能预示着市场即将上涨。需要注意的是，该理论并非绝对准确，需结合其他指标综合分析。  
  **English Explanation**: The Odd Lot Theory is primarily applied in stock market analysis, especially during periods of extreme market sentiment. For instance, when odd lot traders heavily buy a particular stock, it may indicate an impending market decline; conversely, when they sell off significantly, it may signal an upcoming market rise. It’s important to note that this theory is not infallible and should be used in conjunction with other indicators for comprehensive analysis.
