  **中文解释**：On-the-Run Treasury Yield Curve（最新国债收益率曲线）是指由美国财政部最新发行的国债（即“on-the-run”国债）的收益率构成的曲线。这些国债通常流动性最高，市场交易最活跃，因此其收益率被视为市场基准。该曲线反映了不同期限国债的收益率水平，是衡量市场利率水平和经济预期的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**: The On-the-Run Treasury Yield Curve is a yield curve constructed using the yields of the most recently issued U.S. Treasury securities, known as "on-the-run" Treasuries. These securities are typically the most liquid and actively traded in the market, making their yields a benchmark for market interest rates. The curve illustrates the yield levels across different maturities and serves as a critical tool for gauging market interest rates and economic expectations.
