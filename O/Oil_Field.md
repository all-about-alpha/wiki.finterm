# Oil Field

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：油田是指地下蕴藏有大量石油资源的区域，通常由多个油藏组成，是石油勘探和开发的主要目标。油田的形成与地质构造、沉积环境等因素密切相关。  
  **English Explanation**: An oil field is an area beneath the Earth's surface that contains significant reserves of petroleum, typically composed of multiple oil reservoirs. It is the primary target for oil exploration and development, closely related to geological structures and sedimentary environments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：油田广泛应用于石油开采、炼化及能源供应领域。在开发过程中，需注意环境保护、资源可持续性及技术风险等问题。  
  **English Application**: Oil fields are widely used in oil extraction, refining, and energy supply. During development, attention must be paid to environmental protection, resource sustainability, and technological risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，油田是国家能源安全的重要保障；从投资角度看，油田开发是高回报但高风险的领域；从行业角度看，油田是石油产业链的核心环节。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, oil fields are crucial for national energy security; from an investment perspective, they offer high returns but come with significant risks; from an industry perspective, they are the core of the petroleum supply chain.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：现代油田的发现可追溯到19世纪中叶。1859年，美国宾夕法尼亚州的德雷克井（Drake Well）被认为是世界上第一口商业油井，标志着现代石油工业的开端。此后，全球范围内陆续发现了多个大型油田。  
  **English Origin**: The discovery of modern oil fields dates back to the mid-19th century. In 1859, the Drake Well in Pennsylvania, USA, is considered the world's first commercial oil well, marking the beginning of the modern petroleum industry. Since then, numerous large oil fields have been discovered worldwide.
