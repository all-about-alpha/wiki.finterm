# Unrecorded Deed

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：未登记契约（Unrecorded Deed）是指虽然已经签署并交付，但尚未在相关政府机构（如土地登记处）进行正式登记的财产转让文件。这类契约通常涉及房地产交易，但由于未登记，其法律效力可能受到限制。  
  **English Explanation**: An unrecorded deed refers to a property transfer document that has been signed and delivered but has not been formally registered with the relevant government authority (such as a land registry). Such deeds typically involve real estate transactions, but their legal validity may be limited due to the lack of registration.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：未登记契约常见于私人之间的房地产交易，尤其是在买卖双方信任度较高或急于完成交易的情况下。然而，未登记契约存在较大风险，如第三方可能对同一财产提出权利主张，导致法律纠纷。因此，建议在交易完成后尽快完成登记手续。  
  **English Explanation**: Unrecorded deeds are often seen in private real estate transactions, especially when there is a high level of trust between the buyer and seller or when the transaction needs to be completed quickly. However, unrecorded deeds carry significant risks, such as potential claims by third parties on the same property, leading to legal disputes. Therefore, it is advisable to complete the registration process as soon as possible after the transaction.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从法律和投资角度来看，未登记契约的重要性在于其潜在的法律风险。未登记的契约可能无法对抗第三方的权利主张，从而影响财产所有权的稳定性。此外，金融机构在评估抵押贷款时通常要求查看已登记的契约，以确保其法律效力。  
  **English Explanation**: From a legal and investment perspective, the significance of unrecorded deeds lies in their potential legal risks. Unrecorded deeds may not be enforceable against third-party claims, thereby affecting the stability of property ownership. Additionally, financial institutions typically require recorded deeds when evaluating mortgage applications to ensure their legal validity.

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：未登记契约的概念可以追溯到早期的土地交易实践。在没有完善的登记制度之前，许多土地交易仅通过口头协议或简单的书面契约完成。随着土地登记制度的建立，未登记契约的法律效力逐渐受到限制，以保护交易各方的权益。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of unrecorded deeds dates back to early land transaction practices. Before the establishment of comprehensive registration systems, many land transactions were completed through oral agreements or simple written deeds.
