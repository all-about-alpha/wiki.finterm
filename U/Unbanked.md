# Unbanked

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “无银行账户人群”（Unbanked）指的是那些没有在传统银行或金融机构开设账户的个人或家庭。这类人群通常依赖现金交易或非正规金融服务来满足日常金融需求。这一概念最早由世界银行等国际组织提出，用于描述金融包容性不足的问题。核心概念包括金融排斥、金融服务可及性和普惠金融。  

  **English Explanation**  
  The term "Unbanked" refers to individuals or households that do not have an account with a traditional bank or financial institution. These individuals typically rely on cash transactions or informal financial services to meet their daily financial needs. The concept was initially introduced by international organizations such as the World Bank to describe issues related to financial exclusion. Key concepts include financial exclusion, access to financial services, and financial inclusion.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  无银行账户人群常见于发展中国家或经济欠发达地区，尤其是在农村或偏远地区。他们可能因为缺乏身份证明、收入不稳定或对金融机构不信任而无法获得银行服务。此外，无银行账户人群也存在于发达国家的低收入群体中。风险提示：这类人群容易受到高利贷、诈骗等非正规金融活动的侵害，同时也难以积累信用记录，限制了其未来获得正规金融服务的机会。  

  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Unbanked individuals are commonly found in developing countries or economically disadvantaged regions, particularly in rural or remote areas. They may lack access to banking services due to the absence of identification documents, unstable income, or distrust in financial institutions. Additionally, unbanked populations exist among low-income groups in developed countries. Risk Note: These individuals are vulnerable to informal financial activities such as usury and fraud, and they often struggle to build credit histories, limiting their future access to formal financial services.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，减少无银行账户人群是推动普惠金融的重要目标，有助于提升金融体系的包容性和稳定性。从投资角度看，为无银行账户人群提供金融服务（如移动支付、小额信贷）是一个巨大的市场机会。从行业角度看，金融科技的发展为服务这一群体提供了新的工具和解决方案，例如通过数字银行和区块链技术降低服务成本。  

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, reducing the unbanked population is a key goal in promoting financial inclusion, which enhances the inclusivity and stability of the financial system. From an investment perspective, providing financial services (such as mobile payments and microcredit) to the unbanked represents a significant market opportunity. From an industry perspective, the development of fintech offers new tools and solutions to serve this group, such as digital banking and blockchain technology, which reduce service costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  “无银行账户人群”这一概念最早由世界银行在20世纪90年代提出，旨在研究全球金融服务的普及程度。随着全球化进程的加速，国际社会逐渐意识到金融排斥对经济发展和社会稳定的负面影响。2005年，世界银行启动了“全球普惠金融倡议”（Global Findex），通过数据收集和分析，进一步揭示了无银行账户人群的规模和分布。  

  **English Origin**  
  The concept of the "Unbanked" was first introduced by the World Bank in the 1990s to study the accessibility of financial services globally. As globalization progressed, the international community became increasingly aware of the negative impact of financial exclusion on economic development and social stability. In 2005, the World Bank launched the Global Findex initiative, which used data collection and analysis to further reveal the scale and distribution of the unbanked population.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  无银行账户人群的存在对金融行业和社会经济产生了深远影响。在发展中国家，这一问题阻碍了经济增长和贫困缓解。近年来，随着移动支付和数字金融的普及，许多无银行账户人群开始通过非传统渠道获得金融服务。然而，金融排斥问题仍然存在，尤其是在性别不平等和教育水平较低的地区。  

  **English Impact**  
  The existence of the unbanked population has had a profound impact on the financial industry and socio-economic development. In developing countries, this issue hinders economic growth and poverty alleviation. In recent years, with the rise of mobile payments and digital finance, many unbanked individuals have begun accessing financial services through non-traditional channels. However, financial exclusion remains a challenge, particularly in regions with gender inequality and low educational attainment.
