# Up-Market Capture Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：上市场捕获率（Up-Market Capture Ratio）是一种衡量投资组合或基金在市场上涨期间表现相对于基准指数表现的指标。它反映了投资组合在市场上涨时能够“捕获”多少市场收益。该比率由金融分析师和投资经理广泛使用，以评估投资策略在市场上升阶段的效率。  
  **English Explanation**: The Up-Market Capture Ratio is a metric that measures the performance of an investment portfolio or fund relative to a benchmark index during periods of market gains. It indicates how much of the market's upside the portfolio is able to "capture." This ratio is widely used by financial analysts and investment managers to evaluate the efficiency of an investment strategy during market upswings.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：上市场捕获率常用于评估主动管理型基金的表现，特别是在牛市期间。投资者可以通过该比率判断基金经理是否能够在市场上涨时超越基准指数。然而，高上市场捕获率并不一定意味着整体表现优异，还需结合下市场捕获率（Down-Market Capture Ratio）进行综合评估。  
  **English Application**: The Up-Market Capture Ratio is often used to evaluate the performance of actively managed funds, particularly during bull markets. Investors can use this ratio to determine whether a fund manager can outperform the benchmark index during market upswings. However, a high Up-Market Capture Ratio does not necessarily indicate overall superior performance; it should be assessed in conjunction with the Down-Market Capture Ratio for a comprehensive evaluation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，上市场捕获率为投资者提供了一个量化工具，用于评估基金在市场上涨时的表现潜力。它有助于识别那些能够在牛市中获得超额收益的基金，从而优化资产配置和投资决策。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Up-Market Capture Ratio provides investors with a quantitative tool to assess a fund's potential performance during market upswings. It helps identify funds capable of generating excess returns in bull markets, thereby optimizing asset allocation and investment decisions.
