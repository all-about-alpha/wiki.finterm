  **核心概念**：少报收入、财务欺诈、逃税。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Under Reporting refers to the intentional or unintentional act of understating income, profits, or other financial data in financial reports or tax filings by businesses or individuals. This behavior may be aimed at reducing tax liabilities, evading regulatory scrutiny, or concealing the true financial condition. Under Reporting is often associated with financial fraud or tax evasion and is a key target for regulatory authorities.  
  **Core Concepts**: Understating income, financial fraud, tax evasion.  

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  低报行为常见于企业财务报表、个人所得税申报以及跨境贸易中。例如，企业可能通过虚报成本或少报收入来降低应纳税额；个人可能通过隐瞒收入或少报资产来逃避税务稽查。低报行为不仅违反法律法规，还可能引发严重的法律后果，如罚款、行政处罚甚至刑事责任。  
  **风险提示**：低报行为一旦被发现，可能导致企业信誉受损、投资者信心下降，甚至引发市场波动。  

  **English Application**:  
  Under Reporting is commonly observed in corporate financial statements, individual income tax filings, and cross-border trade. For example, businesses may overstate costs or underreport income to reduce taxable amounts, while individuals may conceal income or underreport assets to evade tax audits. Under Reporting not only violates laws and regulations but may also lead to severe legal consequences, such as fines, administrative penalties, or even criminal liability.  
  **Risk Notes**: Once detected, Under Reporting can damage corporate reputation, erode investor confidence, and even trigger market volatility.  

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，低报行为破坏了税收公平性和市场透明度，影响国家财政收入和经济秩序。从投资角度看，低报可能导致财务报表失真，误导投资者决策，增加投资风险。从行业角度看，低报行为可能引发恶性竞争，损害行业整体健康发展。因此，打击低报行为是维护市场公平和投资者权益的重要举措。

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  低报行为的起源可以追溯到古代税收制度。早在罗马帝国时期，就有记录显示纳税人通过隐瞒财产或少报收入来逃避税负。现代意义上的低报行为则随着工业革命和现代企业制度的兴起而逐渐普遍化。20世纪初，随着财务报表和税务申报制度的规范化，低报行为开始受到监管机构的关注。例如，1929年大萧条后，美国通过《证券法》和《证券交易法》加强了对财务报告的监管，低报行为成为重点打击对象。  

  **English Origin**:  
  The origin of Under Reporting can be traced back to ancient tax systems. As early as the Roman Empire, records show taxpayers evading taxes by concealing property or underreporting income. In the modern sense, Under Reporting became more prevalent with the rise of the Industrial Revolution and modern corporate systems. In the early 20th century, as financial reporting and tax filing systems became standardized, Under Reporting began to attract regulatory attention. For example, after the Great Depression of 1929, the U.S. strengthened financial reporting oversight through the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, making Under Reporting a key target.  

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  低报行为对全球经济产生了深远影响。例如，2001年安然公司（Enron）因财务造假和低报债务而破产，引发了全球对财务透明度的关注。此后，各国纷纷加强了对企业财务报告的监管，如美国颁布《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》（SOX法案），要求企业提高财务披露的透明度。在中国，近年来随着税务稽查力度的加大，低报行为逐渐减少，但仍需警惕其潜在风险。  

  **English Impact**:  
  Under Reporting has had a profound impact on the global economy. For instance, the collapse of Enron in 2001 due to financial fraud and underreported debt sparked worldwide attention to financial transparency. Subsequently, countries strengthened corporate financial reporting regulations, such as the U.S. enacting the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX Act) to enhance financial disclosure transparency. In China, with increased tax audit efforts in recent years, Under Reporting has gradually decreased, but potential risks remain.
