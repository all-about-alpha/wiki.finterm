# Usury Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 高利贷利率（Usury Rate）是指法律或监管机构规定的贷款或借款的最高合法利率。超过这一利率的借贷行为被视为高利贷，通常受到法律的严格限制或禁止。这一概念起源于古代社会对公平借贷的追求，旨在保护借款人免受剥削。  
  **English Explanation**: The usury rate refers to the maximum legal interest rate set by law or regulatory authorities for loans or borrowings. Any lending activity that exceeds this rate is considered usurious and is typically subject to strict legal restrictions or prohibitions. This concept originated from ancient societies' pursuit of fair lending practices, aiming to protect borrowers from exploitation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 高利贷利率在现代金融体系中主要用于规范民间借贷和金融机构的贷款行为。例如，在中国，《民法典》明确规定了民间借贷的利率上限，超过这一上限的利息不受法律保护。此外，监管机构通过设定高利贷利率来防止金融欺诈和非法集资等行为。  
  **English Explanation**: In modern financial systems, the usury rate is primarily used to regulate private lending and the loan activities of financial institutions. For instance, in China, the Civil Code explicitly sets an upper limit on interest rates for private loans, and any interest exceeding this limit is not legally protected. Additionally, regulatory authorities use the usury rate to prevent financial fraud and illegal fundraising.
