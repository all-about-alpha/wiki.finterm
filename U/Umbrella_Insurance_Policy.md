# Umbrella Insurance Policy

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：伞形保险政策（Umbrella Insurance Policy）是一种额外的责任保险，旨在为个人或企业提供超出其现有保险政策（如汽车保险、房屋保险）限额的额外保障。它覆盖了多种类型的责任风险，包括人身伤害、财产损失以及某些法律诉讼费用。伞形保险的核心概念是“超额保障”，即在基础保险赔付限额用尽后，伞形保险才会生效。  
  - **English Explanation**: An Umbrella Insurance Policy is an additional liability insurance designed to provide extra coverage beyond the limits of existing insurance policies (such as auto or homeowners insurance). It covers various types of liability risks, including bodily injury, property damage, and certain legal fees. The core concept of umbrella insurance is "excess coverage," meaning it only takes effect after the limits of the underlying insurance policies have been exhausted.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：伞形保险适用于高净值个人、企业主或拥有较多资产的家庭。例如，当发生重大交通事故或他人因意外受伤而提起诉讼时，伞形保险可以提供额外的赔偿保障。需要注意的是，伞形保险通常不覆盖故意行为、合同责任或商业活动中的特定风险。  
  - **English Application**: Umbrella insurance is suitable for high-net-worth individuals, business owners, or families with significant assets. For example, in the event of a major car accident or a lawsuit due to accidental injury, umbrella insurance can provide additional compensation. It is important to note that umbrella insurance typically does not cover intentional acts, contractual liabilities, or specific risks in business operations.
