* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  超高速交易广泛应用于股票、期货、外汇等金融市场。其典型应用场景包括套利交易（如跨市场套利、统计套利）、做市商策略以及基于市场微观结构的交易策略。然而，超高速交易也伴随着较高的风险，如技术故障、市场波动加剧以及潜在的操纵市场行为。因此，监管机构对其进行了严格监控，以防止系统性风险和市场不公平现象。  
  **English Application**  
  Ultrafast Trading is widely applied in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and forex. Typical use cases include arbitrage strategies (e.g., cross-market arbitrage, statistical arbitrage), market-making strategies, and trading strategies based on market microstructure. However, ultrafast trading also carries significant risks, such as technical failures, increased market volatility, and potential market manipulation. As a result, regulatory bodies closely monitor these activities to prevent systemic risks and ensure market fairness.
