# Unsecured Creditors

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 无担保债权人是指在债务人破产或违约时，没有特定资产作为担保的债权人。他们的债权不依赖于任何抵押物，因此在清偿顺序中通常排在有担保债权人之后。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsecured creditors are creditors who do not have specific assets pledged as collateral in the event of a debtor's bankruptcy or default. Their claims are not backed by any collateral, and they typically rank lower in priority compared to secured creditors during the repayment process.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 无担保债权人常见于企业破产清算、债务重组等场景。例如，供应商、服务提供商和部分债券持有人可能成为无担保债权人。由于缺乏抵押物，他们面临较高的回收风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Unsecured creditors are often involved in scenarios such as corporate bankruptcy liquidation or debt restructuring. For example, suppliers, service providers, and certain bondholders may be unsecured creditors. Due to the lack of collateral, they face higher recovery risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管和投资角度看，无担保债权人的存在提醒投资者关注债务人的信用风险和偿债能力。在破产法中，无担保债权人的权益保护是法律完善的重要方向之一。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory and investment perspective, the existence of unsecured creditors highlights the importance of assessing a debtor's credit risk and repayment capacity. In bankruptcy law, protecting the rights of unsecured creditors is a key area for legal improvement.
