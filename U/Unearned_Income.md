# Unearned Income

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：未实现收入（Unearned Income）是指个人或企业已经收到但尚未通过提供商品或服务而实现的收入。这类收入通常以预付款或预收账款的形式存在，只有在未来完成相应的义务后，才能确认为已实现收入。  
  **English Explanation**: Unearned income refers to income that has been received by an individual or business but has not yet been earned through the provision of goods or services. This type of income typically exists in the form of prepayments or deferred revenue and can only be recognized as earned income once the corresponding obligations are fulfilled in the future.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：未实现收入常见于订阅服务、预付款合同、租金预收等场景。例如，软件公司可能提前收取一年的订阅费用，但需按月提供服务。风险在于，若公司无法履行义务，可能面临退款或法律纠纷。  
  **English Application**: Unearned income is commonly seen in subscription services, prepayment contracts, and advance rent collection. For example, a software company may collect a year's subscription fee in advance but must provide services monthly. The risk lies in the company's inability to fulfill its obligations, potentially leading to refunds or legal disputes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，未实现收入需在财务报表中明确披露，以确保财务透明性。从投资角度看，投资者需关注企业的未实现收入比例，以评估其现金流和未来收入稳定性。行业角度，未实现收入反映了企业的预收款能力，是其市场地位的体现。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, unearned income must be clearly disclosed in financial statements to ensure transparency. From an investment standpoint, investors need to pay attention to the proportion of unearned income to assess a company's cash flow and future revenue stability. From an industry perspective, unearned income reflects a company's ability to collect prepayments, indicating its market position.
