# Uptick

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Uptick（上涨点）是指股票或其他金融工具的价格较前一笔交易价格上涨的最小单位。这一概念最早由美国证券交易委员会（SEC）引入，用于描述市场中的价格变动。核心概念在于强调价格的微小上涨，通常用于分析市场趋势或执行特定交易策略。  
  **English Explanation**: An uptick refers to the smallest unit of price increase in a stock or other financial instrument compared to the previous transaction. This concept was originally introduced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to describe price movements in the market. The core idea emphasizes a slight upward movement in price, often used for analyzing market trends or executing specific trading strategies.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：Uptick常用于“上涨点规则”（Uptick Rule），即卖空交易只能在股票价格出现上涨点时执行，以防止恶意做空和市场操纵。这一规则在2007年被废除，但在2008年金融危机后部分恢复。投资者需注意，Uptick的观察有助于判断市场情绪和短期趋势。  
  **English Application**: The uptick is commonly associated with the "Uptick Rule," which mandates that short selling can only occur when a stock's price has experienced an uptick, aimed at preventing malicious short selling and market manipulation. This rule was abolished in 2007 but partially reinstated after the 2008 financial crisis. Investors should note that observing upticks can help gauge market sentiment and short-term trends.
