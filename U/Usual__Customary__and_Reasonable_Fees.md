# Usual, Customary, and Reasonable Fees

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：通常、惯例和合理费用（Usual, Customary, and Reasonable Fees，简称UCR）是指在特定行业或地区内，某项服务或产品所收取的普遍、符合惯例且合理的费用标准。这一概念常用于保险、医疗和法律等领域，用于评估服务提供者收取的费用是否在合理范围内。  
  **English Explanation**: Usual, Customary, and Reasonable Fees (UCR) refer to the standard, customary, and reasonable charges for a specific service or product within a particular industry or region. This concept is commonly used in fields such as insurance, healthcare, and law to assess whether the fees charged by service providers are within a reasonable range.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在医疗保险中，UCR费用用于确定保险公司对医疗服务费用的报销比例。例如，当患者接受医疗服务后，保险公司会根据UCR标准评估医疗账单，并按照这一标准进行赔付。风险在于，如果服务提供者的收费高于UCR标准，患者可能需要自付差额部分。  
  **English Application**: In health insurance, UCR fees are used to determine the reimbursement rate for medical services. For example, after a patient receives medical care, the insurance company evaluates the medical bill based on UCR standards and reimburses accordingly. The risk is that if the provider's charges exceed the UCR standard, the patient may need to pay the difference out of pocket.

  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，UCR费用有助于防止服务提供者过度收费，保护消费者权益；从投资角度看，了解UCR标准有助于评估相关行业的盈利能力和风险；从行业角度看，UCR费用是规范市场定价的重要工具。
