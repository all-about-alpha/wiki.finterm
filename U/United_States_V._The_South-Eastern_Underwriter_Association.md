* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：美国诉东南承保人协会案（United States v. The South-Eastern Underwriter Association）是美国最高法院于1944年审理的一起具有里程碑意义的反垄断案件。该案件涉及东南承保人协会及其成员公司被指控违反《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》（Sherman Antitrust Act），通过共谋固定保险费率和限制竞争。最高法院最终裁定，保险业属于州际贸易范畴，因此受联邦反垄断法的管辖。  
  **English Explanation**: United States v. The South-Eastern Underwriter Association is a landmark antitrust case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1944. The case involved the South-Eastern Underwriter Association and its member companies, which were accused of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by conspiring to fix insurance rates and restrict competition. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the insurance industry falls under interstate commerce and is therefore subject to federal antitrust laws.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：20世纪40年代初期，美国司法部对东南承保人协会及其成员公司提起诉讼，指控其通过共谋固定保险费率、分配市场份额等行为违反了《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》。此前，保险业通常被视为不受联邦反垄断法约束的行业。1944年6月5日，美国最高法院以4:3的投票结果裁定保险业属于州际贸易范畴，受联邦法律管辖。  
  **English Origin**: In the early 1940s, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the South-Eastern Underwriter Association and its member companies, accusing them of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by conspiring to fix insurance rates and allocate market shares. Previously, the insurance industry was generally considered exempt from federal antitrust laws. On June 5, 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 4:3 decision that the insurance industry falls under interstate commerce and is subject to federal law.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：该判决打破了保险业不受联邦反垄断法约束的传统观念，促使国会于1945年通过了《麦卡伦-弗格森法案》（McCarran-Ferguson Act），明确赋予各州对保险业的监管权，同时允许某些行为在特定条件下豁免于联邦反垄断法。这一案件至今仍是美国保险法和反垄断法领域的重要参考案例。  
  **English Impact**: This ruling overturned the traditional notion that the insurance industry was exempt from federal antitrust laws, prompting Congress to pass the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. This act explicitly granted states regulatory authority over the insurance industry while allowing certain practices to be exempt from federal antitrust laws under specific conditions. This case remains an important reference in U.S. insurance law and antitrust law.
