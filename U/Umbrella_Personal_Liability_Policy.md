# Umbrella Personal Liability Policy

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    个人综合责任保险（Umbrella Personal Liability Policy）是一种补充性保险，旨在为个人提供超出其现有保险（如汽车保险、房屋保险）责任限额的额外保障。它覆盖了多种责任风险，包括人身伤害、财产损失以及某些法律诉讼费用。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    An Umbrella Personal Liability Policy is a supplementary insurance designed to provide additional coverage beyond the limits of existing policies (such as auto or homeowners insurance). It covers various liability risks, including bodily injury, property damage, and certain legal defense costs.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    个人综合责任保险适用于高净值个人或家庭，尤其是那些拥有较多资产或面临较高责任风险的人群。例如，如果某人因意外事故导致他人严重受伤，且赔偿金额超出其汽车保险的责任限额，个人综合责任保险可以填补这一缺口。需要注意的是，该保险通常不覆盖故意行为或商业活动相关的责任。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    An Umbrella Personal Liability Policy is suitable for high-net-worth individuals or families, particularly those with significant assets or higher liability risks. For example, if someone causes a severe injury to another person in an accident and the compensation exceeds the liability limit of their auto insurance, the umbrella policy can cover the gap. It is important to note that this insurance typically does not cover intentional acts or liabilities related to business activities.
