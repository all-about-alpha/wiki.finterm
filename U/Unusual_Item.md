# Unusual Item

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非常规项目（Unusual Item）是指在企业财务报表中出现的非经常性、非重复性的收入或支出项目。这些项目通常与企业的日常经营活动无关，可能是由于一次性事件、特殊交易或不可预见的因素引起的。例如，资产出售、法律诉讼赔偿、自然灾害损失等。  
  **English Explanation**: An unusual item refers to non-recurring, non-repetitive income or expense items that appear in a company's financial statements. These items are typically unrelated to the company's regular business operations and may arise from one-time events, special transactions, or unforeseen factors. Examples include asset sales, legal settlement payments, or losses from natural disasters.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：在财务分析中，非常规项目需要被单独列示，以便投资者和分析师能够更准确地评估企业的核心经营业绩。忽略这些项目可能导致对企业财务状况的误解。例如，一家公司可能因出售资产而获得一次性收益，但这并不代表其主营业务盈利能力增强。  
  **English Application**: In financial analysis, unusual items need to be separately disclosed so that investors and analysts can more accurately assess a company's core operating performance. Ignoring these items may lead to misinterpretation of the company's financial health. For example, a company may record a one-time gain from selling an asset, but this does not indicate improved profitability in its main business.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，非常规项目的透明披露有助于提高财务报表的可信度；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者区分企业的可持续盈利能力和一次性收益；从行业角度看，它反映了企业在应对突发事件或特殊交易时的财务处理能力。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, transparent disclosure of unusual items enhances the credibility of financial statements; from an investment perspective, it helps investors distinguish between sustainable profitability and one-time gains; from an industry perspective, it reflects a company's ability to handle unexpected events or special transactions financially.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：非常规项目的概念最早出现在20世纪中期的美国会计准则中。随着企业财务活动的复杂化，监管机构意识到需要将非经常性项目与日常经营业绩分开列示，以提供更清晰的财务信息。1973年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）正式将其纳入会计准则体系。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of unusual items first appeared in U.S. accounting standards in the mid-20th century. As corporate financial activities became more complex, regulators recognized the need to separate non-recurring items from regular operating performance to provide clearer financial information. In 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) formally incorporated it into the accounting standards system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：非常规项目的引入对全球财务报告标准产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了财务报表的透明度，还促使企业在处理特殊交易时更加谨慎和规范。目前，这一概念已被国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和各国会计准则广泛采纳。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of unusual items has had a profound impact on global financial reporting standards. It has not only enhanced the transparency of financial statements but also encouraged companies to handle special transactions more cautiously and systematically. Today, this concept is widely adopted by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and national accounting standards worldwide.
