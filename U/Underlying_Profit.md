# Underlying Profit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  核心利润（Underlying Profit）是指企业在剔除一次性、非经常性项目后的持续经营利润，反映了企业核心业务的盈利能力。这一概念通常由企业管理层或财务分析师提出，用于更准确地评估企业的长期经营表现。核心利润排除了诸如资产出售、重组费用、法律诉讼等非经常性项目的影响，专注于企业日常运营的财务表现。  

  **English Explanation**：  
  Underlying Profit refers to a company's ongoing operational profit after excluding one-time or non-recurring items, reflecting the profitability of its core business. This concept is typically introduced by management or financial analysts to provide a more accurate assessment of a company's long-term performance. It excludes the impact of non-recurring items such as asset sales, restructuring costs, or legal settlements, focusing solely on the financial performance of day-to-day operations.  

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  核心利润常用于企业财务报告和投资者分析中，特别是在评估企业的可持续盈利能力时。例如，在上市公司发布财报时，管理层可能会强调核心利润，以展示企业在剔除一次性因素后的真实经营状况。投资者和分析师也会使用核心利润来比较不同企业的经营效率，尤其是在行业波动或经济不确定性较高的情况下。需要注意的是，核心利润并非会计准则规定的标准指标，因此不同企业可能对其定义和计算方式存在差异，需谨慎使用。  

  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  Underlying Profit is commonly used in financial reporting and investor analysis, particularly when assessing a company's sustainable profitability. For example, when a publicly traded company releases its financial results, management may emphasize Underlying Profit to demonstrate the company's true operational performance after excluding one-time factors. Investors and analysts also use Underlying Profit to compare the operational efficiency of different companies, especially during periods of industry volatility or economic uncertainty. It is important to note that Underlying Profit is not a standardized metric under accounting principles, so its definition and calculation may vary between companies, requiring careful interpretation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  核心利润的概念起源于20世纪80年代，随着企业财务报告的复杂化，投资者和分析师开始寻求更透明、更稳定的盈利指标。这一时期，许多企业通过一次性项目（如资产出售或重组）来美化财务报表，导致传统净利润指标失真。为应对这一问题，财务分析师提出了核心利润的概念，旨在剔除非经常性项目的影响，更真实地反映企业的经营状况。

  The concept of Underlying Profit emerged in the 1980s as corporate financial reporting became increasingly complex, prompting investors and analysts to seek more transparent and stable profitability metrics. During this period, many companies used one-time items, such as asset sales or restructuring, to embellish their financial statements, distorting traditional net profit figures. To address this issue, financial analysts introduced the concept of Underlying Profit, aiming to exclude the impact of non-recurring items and provide a more accurate reflection of a company's operational performance.
