# Unsecured Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 无担保贷款是指借款人无需提供任何抵押品或担保物即可获得的贷款。这类贷款通常基于借款人的信用记录和还款能力，由银行或其他金融机构发放。由于缺乏抵押物，无担保贷款的风险较高，因此利率通常也较高。  
  **English Explanation**: An unsecured loan is a type of loan that does not require the borrower to provide any collateral or security. It is typically issued by banks or other financial institutions based on the borrower's credit history and repayment ability. Due to the absence of collateral, unsecured loans carry higher risk and thus usually come with higher interest rates.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 无担保贷款广泛应用于个人消费、教育、医疗等场景。例如，信用卡透支、个人信用贷款等都属于无担保贷款。由于无需抵押物，申请流程相对简便，但借款人需注意高利率和严格的信用审查。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsecured loans are widely used in personal consumption, education, medical expenses, and other scenarios. For example, credit card overdrafts and personal credit loans fall under this category. The application process is relatively simple due to the lack of collateral, but borrowers should be aware of high interest rates and stringent credit checks.
