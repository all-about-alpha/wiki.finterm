* **起源 / Origin**  
  无保留意见的概念起源于20世纪初的现代审计实践。随着企业规模的扩大和资本市场的复杂化，投资者和债权人需要独立第三方对财务报表进行验证。美国注册会计师协会（AICPA）和国际会计师联合会（IFAC）等组织逐步制定了审计标准和报告格式，其中无保留意见成为最理想的审计结论。  
  The concept of an unqualified opinion originated in early 20th-century modern auditing practices. As businesses grew and capital markets became more complex, investors and creditors required independent third-party verification of financial statements.
