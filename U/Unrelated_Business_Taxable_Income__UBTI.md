# Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：无关业务应税收入（Unrelated Business Taxable Income, UBTI）是指免税组织（如慈善机构、教育机构等）通过与其免税目的无关的商业活动所获得的收入。这类收入需要缴纳所得税，以确保免税组织不会通过无关商业活动获得不公平的税收优势。核心概念包括“无关业务”和“应税收入”。  
  **English Explanation**: Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI) refers to income earned by tax-exempt organizations (such as charities, educational institutions, etc.) through business activities unrelated to their tax-exempt purpose. This income is subject to income tax to ensure that tax-exempt organizations do not gain an unfair tax advantage through unrelated business activities. Key concepts include "unrelated business" and "taxable income."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景与风险提示**：UBTI通常出现在免税组织从事与其核心使命无关的商业活动时，例如运营一家与慈善目的无关的餐厅或投资于某些类型的合伙企业。需要注意的是，如果UBTI超过一定金额，免税组织可能需要提交990-T表格并缴纳相应税款。此外，不当处理UBTI可能导致税务审计或罚款。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: UBTI typically arises when tax-exempt organizations engage in business activities unrelated to their core mission, such as operating a restaurant unrelated to charitable purposes or investing in certain types of partnerships. It is important to note that if UBTI exceeds a certain amount, the organization may need to file Form 990-T and pay the corresponding taxes. Additionally, improper handling of UBTI can lead to tax audits or penalties.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，UBTI制度确保免税组织不会滥用其税收优惠地位进行商业活动；从投资角度看，了解UBTI有助于投资者评估免税组织的财务健康状况；从行业角度看，UBTI规则促进了公平竞争环境。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the UBTI system ensures that tax-exempt organizations do not abuse their tax-advantaged status for commercial activities; from an investment perspective, understanding UBTI helps investors assess the financial health of tax-exempt organizations; from an industry perspective, UBTI rules promote a fair competitive environment.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文历史背景**：UBTI的概念起源于1950年美国《国内税收法典》（Internal Revenue Code）的修订。当时，国会发现一些免税组织通过从事与其使命无关的商业活动获取大量收入，从而规避了应缴税款。为了堵塞这一漏洞，国会引入了UBTI制度。  
  **English Historical Background**: The concept of UBTI originated from the revision of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States in 1950. At that time, Congress discovered that some tax-exempt organizations were generating substantial income through business activities unrelated to their mission, thereby avoiding taxes. To close this loophole, Congress introduced the UBTI system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文行业影响与现状**：自引入以来，UBTI制度对免税组织的商业行为产生了深远影响，促使它们更加专注于其核心使命。目前，许多国家在制定相关税法时参考了美国的UBTI制度。在中国，随着非营利组织的发展，类似规则也逐渐被引入和讨论。  
  **English Impact Description**: Since its introduction, the UBTI system has had a profound impact on the commercial behavior of tax-exempt organizations, encouraging them to focus more on their core mission. Currently, many countries refer to the U.S. UBTI system when formulating relevant tax laws. In China, with the development of non-profit organizations, similar rules are gradually being introduced and discussed.
