# Uncommitted Facility

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  非承诺性融资（Uncommitted Facility）是指金融机构向借款人提供的一种非约束性信贷安排。在这种安排下，金融机构没有法律义务必须提供资金，借款人也不能强制要求金融机构放款。这种融资方式通常用于短期资金需求，且利率和条款较为灵活。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  An uncommitted facility refers to a non-binding credit arrangement provided by a financial institution to a borrower. Under this arrangement, the financial institution is not legally obligated to provide funds, and the borrower cannot compel the institution to disburse the loan. This type of financing is typically used for short-term funding needs and offers flexible interest rates and terms.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  非承诺性融资常用于企业短期流动性管理，如应对季节性资金需求或临时性支出。由于金融机构没有放款义务，借款人需承担一定的风险，即资金可能无法及时到位。因此，企业通常会将非承诺性融资与其他融资工具结合使用，以确保资金链的稳定。  
  **English Application**：  
  Uncommitted facilities are often used by businesses for short-term liquidity management, such as addressing seasonal funding needs or temporary expenses. Since the financial institution is not obligated to provide funds, the borrower bears the risk that funds may not be available when needed. As a result, businesses typically combine uncommitted facilities with other financing tools to ensure stable cash flow.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，非承诺性融资有助于金融机构灵活管理信贷风险，避免过度承诺导致的资金压力。从投资角度看，企业使用非承诺性融资可以降低融资成本，但需注意流动性风险。从行业角度看，这种融资方式在贸易融资和供应链金融中应用广泛，支持了中小企业的短期资金需求。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, uncommitted facilities help financial institutions manage credit risk flexibly and avoid the financial strain caused by overcommitment. From an investment standpoint, businesses can reduce financing costs by using uncommitted facilities but must be mindful of liquidity risks. From an industry perspective, this financing method is widely used in trade finance and supply chain finance, supporting the short-term funding needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.
