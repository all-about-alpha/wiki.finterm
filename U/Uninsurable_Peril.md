# Uninsurable Peril

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 不可保风险（Uninsurable Peril）是指那些由于发生概率极高、损失规模巨大或难以预测等原因，保险公司通常不愿或无法承保的风险。这类风险通常超出了保险公司的承保能力范围，或者不符合保险的基本原则，如可计算性和可分散性。  
  **English Explanation**: An uninsurable peril refers to risks that are typically not covered by insurance companies due to their high probability of occurrence, massive potential losses, or unpredictability. These risks often exceed the underwriting capacity of insurers or do not align with fundamental insurance principles such as calculability and dispersibility.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 不可保风险常见于自然灾害（如地震、海啸）、战争、核事故等极端事件。此外，某些人为行为（如恐怖袭击）也可能被视为不可保风险。投保人在面对此类风险时，需通过其他风险管理手段（如自留风险、政府救助）来应对。  
  **English Explanation**: Uninsurable perils are often associated with extreme events such as natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis), wars, and nuclear accidents. Certain human actions, such as terrorist attacks, may also fall into this category. Policyholders facing such risks must rely on alternative risk management strategies, such as self-insurance or government assistance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 不可保风险的识别与管理对保险行业和投保人都至关重要。对于保险公司而言，明确不可保风险的边界有助于优化承保策略和风险管理；对于投保人而言，了解不可保风险的存在有助于制定更全面的风险管理计划。  
  **English Explanation**: Identifying and managing uninsurable perils is crucial for both the insurance industry and policyholders. For insurers, defining the boundaries of uninsurable perils helps optimize underwriting strategies and risk management. For policyholders, understanding the existence of uninsurable perils aids in developing more comprehensive risk management plans.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 不可保风险的概念起源于20世纪初，随着保险业的快速发展和对风险的深入研究，人们逐渐认识到某些极端事件无法通过传统保险机制进行分散和转移。例如，1923年日本关东大地震后，许多保险公司因巨额赔付而破产，促使业界重新审视可保风险的边界。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of uninsurable perils emerged in the early 20th century as the insurance industry rapidly developed and deepened its understanding of risks. It became clear that certain extreme events could not be dispersed or transferred through traditional insurance mechanisms. For instance, after the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan in 1923, many insurers went bankrupt due to massive payouts, prompting a reevaluation of the boundaries of insurable risks.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: 不可保风险的识别对全球保险业产生了深远影响。它推动了再保险市场的发展以及政府与私人部门在风险管理中的合作。例如，许多国家建立了巨灾保险基金或由政府提供灾害救助以应对不可保风险带来的挑战。  
  **English Explanation**: The identification of uninsurable perils has had a profound impact on the global insurance industry. It has spurred the growth of the reinsurance market and fostered collaboration between governments and private sectors in risk management. For example, many countries have established catastrophe insurance funds or government disaster relief programs to address challenges posed by uninsurable perils.
