# Unlimited Marital Deduction

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：无限婚姻扣除（Unlimited Marital Deduction）是美国税法中的一项规定，允许配偶之间在遗产或赠与税方面无限制地转移资产，而无需缴纳联邦遗产税或赠与税。这一政策的核心概念是促进家庭财富的传承，减少因税收导致的财富流失。  
  **English Explanation**: The Unlimited Marital Deduction is a provision in U.S. tax law that allows spouses to transfer an unlimited amount of assets to each other, either during their lifetime or at death, without incurring federal estate or gift taxes. The core concept of this policy is to facilitate the transfer of family wealth and reduce wealth erosion due to taxation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景与风险提示**：无限婚姻扣除主要应用于夫妻之间的财产转移，特别是在一方去世时，遗产可以完全转移给另一方而无需缴税。然而，需要注意的是，如果未亡配偶并非美国公民，则可能无法享受这一扣除的完全优惠。此外，若未亡配偶在继承遗产后再次去世，其继承人可能需要缴纳高额的遗产税。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: The Unlimited Marital Deduction is primarily used for asset transfers between spouses, especially when one spouse passes away, allowing the estate to be transferred entirely to the surviving spouse without tax. However, it’s important to note that if the surviving spouse is not a U.S. citizen, they may not fully benefit from this deduction. Additionally, if the surviving spouse later passes away, their heirs may face significant estate taxes.
