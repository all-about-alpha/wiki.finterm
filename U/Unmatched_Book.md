# Unmatched Book

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：未匹配账（Unmatched Book）是指金融机构在资产负债表中，资产和负债的期限或利率结构不完全匹配的情况。这种不匹配可能导致利率风险或流动性风险，因为资产和负债的现金流可能无法同步。  
  **English Explanation**: An Unmatched Book refers to a situation in a financial institution's balance sheet where the maturities or interest rate structures of assets and liabilities are not fully aligned. This mismatch can lead to interest rate risk or liquidity risk, as the cash flows from assets and liabilities may not be synchronized.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：未匹配账常见于银行、保险公司等金融机构。例如，银行可能持有长期贷款（资产）但依赖短期存款（负债），导致利率变动时利润波动。风险管理中需通过衍生工具或调整资产负债结构来对冲风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Unmatched Books are commonly seen in financial institutions like banks and insurance companies. For instance, a bank might hold long-term loans (assets) but rely on short-term deposits (liabilities), leading to profit volatility when interest rates change. Risk management often involves using derivatives or adjusting the asset-liability structure to hedge against such risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：未匹配账对金融机构的稳健运营至关重要。监管机构通常要求金融机构保持一定的资产负债匹配度，以防范系统性风险。投资者也需关注此类风险，因其可能影响机构的盈利能力和偿债能力。  
  **English Explanation**: The Unmatched Book is crucial for the stable operation of financial institutions. Regulators often require institutions to maintain a certain level of asset-liability matching to prevent systemic risks. Investors also need to be aware of such risks, as they can impact an institution's profitability and solvency.
