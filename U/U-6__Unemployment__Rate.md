    U-6失业率是美国劳工统计局（BLS）发布的一种广义失业率指标，涵盖了失业人口、因经济原因从事兼职工作的人口以及边际劳动力（即那些想要工作但已停止寻找工作的人）。U-6失业率比官方失业率（U-3）更全面地反映了劳动力市场的真实状况。

    The U-6 unemployment rate is a broad measure of unemployment published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It includes unemployed individuals, those working part-time for economic reasons, and marginally attached workers (those who want to work but have stopped looking). The U-6 rate provides a more comprehensive view of the labor market compared to the official unemployment rate (U-3).

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    U-6失业率的概念起源于20世纪90年代，当时美国劳工统计局为了更全面地衡量失业问题，开始发布一系列失业率指标。U-6作为其中最广泛的指标，逐渐成为分析劳动力市场的重要工具。2008年金融危机期间，U-6失业率因其对就业不足和边际劳动力的覆盖而受到广泛关注。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of the U-6 unemployment rate originated in the 1990s when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began publishing a range of unemployment metrics to provide a more comprehensive measure of joblessness. As the broadest indicator, U-6 gradually became a key tool for analyzing the labor market. During the 2008 financial crisis, the U-6 rate gained significant attention for its inclusion of underemployment and marginally attached workers.
