# Unconventional Oil

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非常规石油（Unconventional Oil）是指那些无法通过传统钻井技术直接开采的石油资源。这类资源通常存在于致密岩石、油砂或页岩中，需要通过特殊的技术手段（如水平钻井、水力压裂等）进行开采。非常规石油包括页岩油、油砂油、重油等。  
  **English Explanation**: Unconventional oil refers to petroleum resources that cannot be extracted using traditional drilling methods. These resources are typically found in tight rock formations, oil sands, or shale and require specialized techniques such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing for extraction. Examples include shale oil, oil sands, and heavy oil.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：非常规石油的应用主要集中在能源供应领域，尤其是在传统石油资源逐渐枯竭的情况下。其开采技术复杂，成本较高，且对环境有一定影响（如水资源消耗、温室气体排放等）。主要应用场景包括页岩油开发（如美国页岩油革命）、油砂开采（如加拿大阿尔伯塔省）等。  
  **English Explanation**: Unconventional oil is primarily used in energy supply, especially as traditional oil resources become depleted. Its extraction is technologically complex, costly, and has environmental impacts (e.g., water usage, greenhouse gas emissions). Key applications include shale oil development (e.g., the U.S. shale revolution) and oil sands extraction (e.g., Alberta, Canada).

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：非常规石油对全球能源格局具有重要意义。它增加了石油供应，降低了对外部石油资源的依赖，尤其是在美国等国家。从投资角度看，非常规石油开发吸引了大量资本，推动了相关技术进步。然而，其环境影响也引发了监管和公众的关注。  
  **English Explanation**: Unconventional oil is significant in reshaping the global energy landscape. It increases oil supply and reduces dependence on external resources, particularly in countries like the U.S. From an investment perspective, it has attracted substantial capital and driven technological advancements. However, its environmental impact has raised regulatory and public concerns.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：非常规石油的开采历史可以追溯到20世纪初，但直到20世纪70年代石油危机后，其重要性才逐渐凸显。美国页岩油革命始于21世纪初，得益于水力压裂技术的突破。加拿大油砂开发则始于20世纪60年代，但直到21世纪才大规模商业化。  
  **English Explanation**: The extraction of unconventional oil dates back to the early 20th century, but its significance grew after the 1970s oil crisis. The U.S. shale revolution began in the early 2000s, driven by breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing. Canadian oil sands development started in the 1960s but only became commercially viable on a large scale in the 21st century.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：非常规石油的开发对全球石油市场产生了深远影响。美国页岩油革命使其从石油进口国转变为出口国，改变了全球能源供应格局。加拿大油砂开发则使其成为全球重要的石油生产国。然而，非常规石油的环境影响（如碳排放、生态破坏）也引发了广泛争议。  
  **English Explanation**: The development of unconventional oil has profoundly impacted the global oil market. The U.S. shale revolution transformed the country from an oil importer to an exporter, altering global energy supply dynamics. Canadian oil sands development established the country as a major oil producer. However, the environmental impact (e.g., carbon emissions, ecological damage) has sparked widespread debate.
