  **English Explanation**: An Unlimited Tax Bond is a type of municipal bond issued by local governments, where the repayment ability is backed by the issuer's unlimited taxing authority over all taxable properties within its jurisdiction.

  **English Application**: Unlimited Tax Bonds are commonly used to fund large public projects such as school construction and infrastructure improvements. Backed by unlimited taxing authority, these bonds are generally considered low-risk investments, suitable for conservative investors.
