# Unsecured

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “无担保”是指金融交易中，借款人无需提供任何资产作为抵押品即可获得贷款或信用额度。这类债务完全依赖于借款人的信用评级和还款能力。  
  **English Explanation**: "Unsecured" refers to financial transactions where the borrower does not need to provide any assets as collateral to obtain a loan or credit line. This type of debt relies entirely on the borrower's credit rating and repayment ability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 无担保贷款常见于个人消费贷款、信用卡透支以及部分企业短期融资。由于缺乏抵押物，这类贷款通常利率较高，且对借款人的信用要求更为严格。风险在于，若借款人违约，债权人可能面临较大的资金损失。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Unsecured loans are commonly seen in personal consumer loans, credit card overdrafts, and some short-term corporate financing. Due to the lack of collateral, these loans typically have higher interest rates and stricter credit requirements for borrowers. The risk lies in the fact that if the borrower defaults, the creditor may face significant financial losses.
