# Unsubordinated Debt

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：无次级债务（Unsubordinated Debt）是指在公司破产或清算时，优先于次级债务（Subordinated Debt）获得偿还的债务。这类债务通常具有较高的信用评级，因为债权人在公司资产分配中享有优先权。无次级债务的核心概念在于其清偿顺序的优先性，通常包括银行贷款、公司债券等。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsubordinated debt refers to debt that has priority over subordinated debt in the event of a company's bankruptcy or liquidation. This type of debt typically carries a higher credit rating because creditors have a higher claim on the company's assets. The core concept of unsubordinated debt lies in its priority in the repayment hierarchy, often including bank loans and corporate bonds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：无次级债务广泛应用于企业融资中，尤其是在需要确保债权人利益的情况下。例如，大型企业发行无次级债券以吸引投资者，因为其风险较低。然而，投资者仍需注意企业的整体财务状况和偿债能力，以避免潜在的违约风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsubordinated debt is widely used in corporate financing, particularly when ensuring creditor interests is crucial. For instance, large corporations issue unsubordinated bonds to attract investors due to their lower risk. However, investors must still consider the company's overall financial health and ability to repay to mitigate potential default risks.
