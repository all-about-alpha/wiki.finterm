# Undivided Account

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  未分割账户（Undivided Account）是指在证券承销过程中，承销商将所有投资者的认购资金集中管理，而不立即分配给发行公司的一种账户形式。这种账户通常用于确保承销商能够有效管理资金流动，并在发行结束后根据最终认购情况分配资金。核心概念包括资金集中管理、风险控制和资金分配延迟。  
  **English Explanation**  
  An Undivided Account refers to an account in the underwriting process where the underwriter pools all investors' subscription funds for centralized management, without immediately allocating them to the issuing company. This type of account is typically used to ensure effective liquidity management by the underwriter, with funds being allocated after the issuance based on the final subscription results. Key concepts include centralized fund management, risk control, and delayed fund allocation.

  未分割账户常用于股票或债券的首次公开发行（IPO）中。承销商通过集中管理资金，可以有效应对市场波动和认购不足的风险。此外，这种账户形式也适用于大型项目融资或并购交易中的资金托管。需要注意的是，未分割账户可能增加资金流动性管理的复杂性，承销商需具备较强的风险管理能力。  
  **English Application**  
  Undivided Accounts are commonly used in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) of stocks or bonds. By centralizing fund management, underwriters can effectively mitigate risks associated with market volatility and undersubscription. This account type is also applicable to large-scale project financing or merger and acquisition transactions. However, it may increase the complexity of liquidity management, requiring underwriters to have strong risk management capabilities.

After the 1929 stock market crash, regulatory bodies intensified oversight of fund flows, and Undivided Accounts were gradually adopted as a risk management tool. By the mid-20th century, with the rise of global capital markets, this concept was widely adopted in other countries and regions.
