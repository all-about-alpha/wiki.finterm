# Underwriting Expenses

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：承销费用（Underwriting Expenses）是指投资银行或金融机构在承销证券（如股票、债券等）过程中产生的费用。这些费用通常包括承销商的佣金、法律费用、审计费用、印刷费用以及其他与发行证券相关的行政开支。承销费用通常由发行公司支付，是证券发行总成本的一部分。  
  **English Explanation**: Underwriting expenses refer to the costs incurred by investment banks or financial institutions during the underwriting of securities (such as stocks, bonds, etc.). These expenses typically include underwriting commissions, legal fees, auditing fees, printing costs, and other administrative expenses related to the issuance of securities. Underwriting expenses are usually paid by the issuing company and form part of the total cost of the securities issuance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：承销费用主要应用于证券发行过程中，尤其是在首次公开募股（IPO）或债券发行时。发行公司需要与承销商协商确定费用结构，通常以发行总额的一定比例计算。风险方面，承销费用过高可能会增加发行成本，影响公司融资效率。  
  **English Application**: Underwriting expenses are primarily applied during the issuance of securities, especially in initial public offerings (IPOs) or bond issuances. The issuing company negotiates the fee structure with the underwriter, typically calculated as a percentage of the total issuance amount. A key risk is that excessively high underwriting expenses can increase the cost of issuance, potentially affecting the company's financing efficiency.
