# Underlying Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：标的资产（Underlying Asset）是指金融衍生品（如期权、期货、掉期等）合约中所依赖的基础资产。标的资产可以是股票、债券、商品、货币、利率、指数或其他金融工具。衍生品的价值直接或间接取决于标的资产的价格变动。  
  **English Explanation**: The underlying asset refers to the foundational asset upon which a financial derivative (such as options, futures, swaps, etc.) is based. The underlying asset can be stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, indices, or other financial instruments. The value of the derivative is directly or indirectly derived from the price movements of the underlying asset.

  **English Explanation**: Underlying assets are widely used in financial derivative markets. For example, in stock options, the underlying asset is a specific stock; in commodity futures, the underlying asset is a commodity such as crude oil or gold.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：标的资产的概念最早可追溯至17世纪的荷兰郁金香泡沫时期，当时郁金香球茎成为期权合约的标的资产。现代金融衍生品市场的发展始于20世纪70年代，随着布雷顿森林体系的瓦解和浮动汇率制的引入，标的资产的种类和复杂性大幅增加。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of underlying assets dates back to the Dutch Tulip Mania in the 17th century, when tulip bulbs became the underlying asset for options contracts.
