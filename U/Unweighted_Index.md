# Unweighted Index

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：未加权指数（Unweighted Index）是一种不考虑成分股市值或价格权重的股票指数。它通常通过简单平均法计算，即将所有成分股的价格或收益率相加后除以股票数量，赋予每只股票相同的权重。这种指数反映了市场整体的平均表现，而不受大市值股票的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: An unweighted index is a type of stock index that does not consider the market capitalization or price weight of its constituent stocks. It is typically calculated using a simple average method, where the prices or returns of all constituent stocks are summed and divided by the number of stocks, giving each stock equal weight. This index reflects the average performance of the market as a whole, without being influenced by large-cap stocks.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：未加权指数常用于衡量市场整体表现，尤其适用于分析中小市值股票的表现。它广泛应用于学术研究、市场趋势分析和投资策略制定中。然而，由于未加权指数忽略了个股市值差异，可能无法准确反映大市值股票对市场的实际影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Unweighted indices are often used to measure the overall performance of the market, particularly for analyzing small- and mid-cap stocks. They are widely applied in academic research, market trend analysis, and investment strategy formulation. However, since unweighted indices ignore differences in individual stock market capitalizations, they may not accurately reflect the actual impact of large-cap stocks on the market.

  **English Explanation**: From the perspective of unweighted indices, they provide investors with a fairer tool for assessing market performance, especially for those focused on small- and mid-cap stocks. From regulatory and industry perspectives, unweighted indices help reveal overall market trends and avoid excessive influence from large-cap stocks.
