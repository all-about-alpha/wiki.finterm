* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  承销（Underwriting）是指金融机构（如投资银行或证券公司）在证券发行过程中，承担购买未售出证券的责任，以确保发行人能够成功筹集资金。承销商通过评估发行人的财务状况和市场条件，确定证券的发行价格和规模，并承担销售风险。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Underwriting refers to the process by which financial institutions (such as investment banks or securities firms) assume the responsibility of purchasing unsold securities during a securities issuance to ensure the issuer successfully raises funds. Underwriters evaluate the issuer's financial condition and market conditions to determine the issuance price and size, and bear the sales risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  承销广泛应用于股票、债券等证券的发行过程中。例如，在企业首次公开募股（IPO）时，承销商负责定价、销售和分配股票。承销商需评估市场风险、发行人信用风险以及流动性风险，以确保发行成功。  
  **English Application**  
  Underwriting is widely used in the issuance of securities such as stocks and bonds. For example, during an Initial Public Offering (IPO), underwriters are responsible for pricing, selling, and allocating shares.
