# Unified Tax Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **统一税收抵免**（Unified Tax Credit）是美国联邦遗产税和赠与税制度中的一项税收优惠政策，允许纳税人在计算应缴税款时，从应纳税额中扣除一定金额。该政策由美国国税局（IRS）制定，旨在减轻纳税人在遗产继承和赠与过程中的税务负担。核心概念包括“统一抵免额”和“终身免税额度”。  
  The **Unified Tax Credit** is a tax benefit under the U.S. federal estate and gift tax system that allows taxpayers to deduct a specific amount from their taxable estate or gifts. Established by the IRS, it aims to reduce the tax burden on individuals during inheritance and gifting processes. Key concepts include the "unified credit amount" and "lifetime exemption."

* **应用 / Application**  
  在美国，统一税收抵免主要应用于遗产税和赠与税的申报。纳税人可以通过合理规划资产转移（如设立信托或进行赠与）来最大化利用这一抵免额度，从而降低税务成本。需要注意的是，抵免额度会随政策调整而变化，且超额部分仍需缴税。  
  In the U.S., the Unified Tax Credit is primarily applied in estate and gift tax filings. Taxpayers can maximize its benefits through strategic asset transfers (e.g., setting up trusts or making gifts) to reduce tax liabilities. It’s important to note that the credit amount may change with policy updates, and any excess is still subject to taxation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  统一税收抵免在财富传承规划中具有重要意义。它不仅帮助高净值家庭合法减少税务支出，还促进了资产的合理分配与代际转移。从监管角度看，该政策平衡了税收收入与个人财产权益之间的关系。  
  The Unified Tax Credit plays a crucial role in wealth transfer planning. It not only helps high-net-worth families legally reduce tax burdens but also promotes fair asset distribution across generations.
