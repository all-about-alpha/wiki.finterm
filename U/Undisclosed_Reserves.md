## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：未披露储备（Undisclosed Reserves）是指金融机构或企业在财务报表中未公开披露的储备金。这些储备通常用于应对未来可能发生的损失或不确定性，但由于其隐蔽性，可能对投资者和监管机构造成信息不对称的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Undisclosed reserves refer to reserves held by financial institutions or companies that are not publicly disclosed in financial statements. These reserves are typically used to cover potential future losses or uncertainties, but their hidden nature can create information asymmetry risks for investors and regulators.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：未披露储备常用于银行业，作为应对贷款违约或其他金融风险的缓冲。然而，由于其不透明性，可能引发市场对金融机构真实财务状况的质疑。投资者需谨慎评估此类机构的财务健康度。

From an investment standpoint, their existence may obscure a company's true profitability or risk levels. Within the industry, they may be used for risk management, but a balance between transparency and flexibility is crucial.
