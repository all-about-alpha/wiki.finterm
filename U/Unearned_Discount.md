# Unearned Discount

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：未实现折扣（Unearned Discount）是指企业在销售商品或服务时，提前收取了客户的款项，但尚未实际提供相应的商品或服务，因此这部分收入不能立即确认为已实现收入，而应作为负债记录在财务报表中。核心概念包括收入确认原则和负债确认。  
  **English Explanation**: Unearned Discount refers to the situation where a company receives payment from customers in advance for goods or services that have not yet been delivered or rendered. As a result, this portion of revenue cannot be immediately recognized as earned income and must be recorded as a liability on the financial statements. Key concepts include revenue recognition principles and liability recognition.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：未实现折扣常见于预付费服务、订阅模式或长期合同业务中。例如，健身房会员费、软件订阅费等。企业需注意在提供完服务或商品后，才能将未实现折扣转为已实现收入，否则可能导致财务报表失真。  
  **English Application**: Unearned Discount is commonly seen in prepaid services, subscription models, or long-term contracts. Examples include gym memberships or software subscriptions. Companies must ensure that unearned discounts are only converted to earned revenue after the service or product is delivered, to avoid misrepresentation in financial statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，未实现折扣的准确处理有助于确保财务报表的透明性和合规性；从投资角度看，它反映了企业的现金流和收入确认质量；从行业角度看，它是衡量企业运营效率的重要指标。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, proper handling of unearned discounts ensures transparency and compliance in financial reporting. From an investment standpoint, it reflects the quality of a company's cash flow and revenue recognition. From an industry perspective, it is a key metric for evaluating operational efficiency.
