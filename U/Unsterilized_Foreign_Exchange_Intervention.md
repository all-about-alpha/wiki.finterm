# Unsterilized Foreign Exchange Intervention

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：非冲销式外汇干预是指中央银行在外汇市场上买卖外币以影响本币汇率，但不通过国内货币政策操作（如公开市场操作）来抵消这种干预对国内货币供应量的影响。这种干预方式会直接改变国内的货币供应量，从而对经济产生更广泛的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsterilized foreign exchange intervention refers to the central bank's buying or selling of foreign currency in the foreign exchange market to influence the exchange rate of the domestic currency, without offsetting the impact of this intervention on the domestic money supply through domestic monetary policy operations (such as open market operations). This type of intervention directly alters the domestic money supply, thereby having broader economic implications.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：非冲销式外汇干预通常用于应对汇率剧烈波动或经济危机。例如，当本币大幅贬值时，央行可能通过出售外汇储备买入本币来稳定汇率。然而，这种干预可能导致国内货币供应量增加，进而引发通货膨胀风险。因此，央行在使用时需权衡汇率稳定与通胀控制之间的平衡。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsterilized foreign exchange intervention is often used to address severe exchange rate fluctuations or economic crises. For example, when the domestic currency depreciates significantly, the central bank may sell foreign exchange reserves to buy the domestic currency to stabilize the exchange rate. However, this intervention may lead to an increase in the domestic money supply, potentially triggering inflation risks. Therefore, central banks must balance exchange rate stability with inflation control when using this tool.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：非冲销式外汇干预在宏观经济调控中具有重要意义。它不仅能直接影响汇率，还能通过改变货币供应量间接影响利率、通胀和经济增长。对于新兴市场国家，这种干预方式在应对资本流动和外部冲击时尤为关键。然而，其副作用（如通胀压力）也需引起重视。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsterilized foreign exchange intervention plays a significant role in macroeconomic regulation. It not only directly influences the exchange rate but also indirectly affects interest rates, inflation, and economic growth by altering the money supply. For emerging market economies, this intervention is particularly crucial in managing capital flows and external shocks. However, its side effects, such as inflationary pressures, must also be carefully considered.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：非冲销式外汇干预的概念起源于20世纪中期，随着布雷顿森林体系的建立，各国开始更加关注汇率稳定。20世纪70年代，随着浮动汇率制的普及，央行开始更频繁地使用外汇干预工具。非冲销式干预因其直接性和有效性，逐渐成为应对汇率波动的重要手段。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of unsterilized foreign exchange intervention originated in the mid-20th century, as countries began to focus more on exchange rate stability with the establishment of the Bretton Woods system. In the 1970s, with the widespread adoption of floating exchange rates, central banks began to use foreign exchange intervention tools more frequently. Unsterilized intervention, due to its directness and effectiveness, gradually became an important tool for addressing exchange rate fluctuations.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：非冲销式外汇干预对全球经济产生了深远影响。例如，在1997年亚洲金融危机期间，一些国家通过非冲销式干预试图稳定本币汇率，但由于货币供应量增加，导致通胀加剧和经济不稳定。如今，许多国家在使用这一工具时更加谨慎，注重与其他政策的协调。  
  **English Explanation**: Unsterilized foreign exchange intervention has had a profound impact on the global economy. For instance, during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, some countries attempted to stabilize their currencies through unsterilized intervention, but the increase in money supply led to heightened inflation and economic instability. Today, many countries use this tool more cautiously, emphasizing coordination with other policies.
