# Underwater Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “水下按揭”（Underwater Mortgage）是指房产的市场价值低于其未偿还的按揭贷款余额的情况。这种情况通常发生在房价大幅下跌时，导致房主无法通过出售房产来偿还贷款。这一概念最早在2008年全球金融危机期间被广泛讨论，当时房地产市场崩盘，许多房主发现自己陷入了“水下”状态。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  An "Underwater Mortgage" refers to a situation where the market value of a property is less than the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan. This typically occurs when property prices experience a significant decline, leaving homeowners unable to repay their loans by selling the property. The term gained prominence during the 2008 global financial crisis when the housing market collapsed, leaving many homeowners "underwater."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  水下按揭常见于房地产市场低迷时期，尤其是在经济衰退或金融危机期间。房主可能面临无法出售房产或再融资的困境，甚至可能被迫选择违约或短售（Short Sale）。对于银行和金融机构而言，水下按揭增加了坏账风险，可能引发系统性金融风险。  
  **English Application**：  
  Underwater mortgages are commonly seen during periods of real estate market downturns, particularly during economic recessions or financial crises. Homeowners may find themselves unable to sell their property or refinance, potentially leading to defaults or short sales. For banks and financial institutions, underwater mortgages increase the risk of bad debts and can trigger systemic financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，水下按揭是衡量房地产市场健康程度的重要指标，也是金融稳定性的潜在威胁。从投资角度看，水下按揭可能导致房产投资者的资产缩水，影响其财务规划。从行业角度看，水下按揭的普遍存在可能抑制房地产市场的复苏，延长经济调整周期。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, underwater mortgages are a key indicator of the health of the real estate market and a potential threat to financial stability. From an investment standpoint, they can lead to asset depreciation for property investors, impacting their financial planning.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  水下按揭的概念在2008年全球金融危机期间被广泛关注。当时，美国房地产市场泡沫破裂，房价暴跌，导致数百万房主的房产价值低于其按揭贷款余额。这一现象不仅在美国出现，也在全球范围内引发了连锁反应，成为金融危机的重要推手之一。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of underwater mortgages gained widespread attention during the 2008 global financial crisis. At that time, the bursting of the U.S. housing market bubble led to a sharp decline in property prices, leaving millions of homeowners with properties worth less than their mortgage balances. This phenomenon was not limited to the U.S. but also triggered a chain reaction globally, becoming a significant driver of the financial crisis.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  水下按揭对房地产市场和金融体系产生了深远影响。它加剧了房主的财务压力，导致违约率上升，进而引发银行资产质量恶化。此外，水下按揭还抑制了房地产市场的流动性，延缓了经济复苏。目前，许多国家通过政策手段（如贷款重组、政府救助）来缓解这一问题。  
  **English Impact**：  
  Underwater mortgages have had a profound impact on the real estate market and financial systems. They have increased financial pressure on homeowners, leading to higher default rates and deteriorating asset quality for banks. Additionally, underwater mortgages have stifled liquidity in the real estate market, delaying economic recovery. Currently, many countries are addressing this issue through policy measures such as loan restructuring and government bailouts.
