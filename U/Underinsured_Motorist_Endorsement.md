# Underinsured Motorist Endorsement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  不足额保险驾驶人批单（Underinsured Motorist Endorsement）是一种附加在汽车保险单上的条款，旨在为被保险人提供额外的保障。当事故责任方的保险金额不足以覆盖被保险人的损失时，该批单允许被保险人通过自己的保险公司获得差额部分的赔偿。这一条款的核心概念是弥补不足额保险带来的财务风险，确保被保险人在事故中不会因对方保险不足而遭受经济损失。  

  **English Explanation**：  
  An Underinsured Motorist Endorsement is an addendum to an auto insurance policy that provides additional coverage to the insured. When the at-fault party's insurance coverage is insufficient to cover the insured's losses, this endorsement allows the insured to recover the difference from their own insurance company. The core concept of this endorsement is to mitigate the financial risk posed by underinsured drivers, ensuring that the insured does not suffer financial losses due to the other party's inadequate insurance coverage.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  不足额保险驾驶人批单通常适用于以下场景：当被保险人在交通事故中受伤或车辆受损，而责任方的保险金额不足以支付全部损失时，被保险人可以通过自己的保险公司获得差额赔偿。例如，如果责任方的保险限额为10万元，而被保险人的实际损失为15万元，不足额保险驾驶人批单可以覆盖剩余的5万元。需要注意的是，该批单的赔偿金额通常受限于保单中规定的限额，且可能不适用于所有类型的损失（如财产损失）。  

  **English Application**：  
  The Underinsured Motorist Endorsement is typically applied in scenarios where the insured is injured or their vehicle is damaged in an accident, and the at-fault party's insurance coverage is insufficient to cover the total losses. For example, if the at-fault party's insurance limit is $10,000 and the insured's actual loss is $15,000, the endorsement can cover the remaining $5,000. It is important to note that the coverage amount is usually subject to the limits specified in the policy and may not apply to all types of losses (e.g., property damage).
