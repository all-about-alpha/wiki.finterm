## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 全能银行的起源可以追溯到19世纪的德国。当时德国的工业化和经济发展需要大量资金支持，传统商业银行无法满足这一需求。因此，德国银行开始整合商业银行业务和投资银行业务，形成了早期的全能银行模式。这一模式后来被其他国家借鉴和发展。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of Universal Banking can be traced back to Germany in the 19th century. At that time, Germany's industrialization and economic development required substantial financial support that traditional commercial banks could not meet. Consequently, German banks began integrating commercial banking with investment banking, forming the early model of Universal Banking. This model was later adopted and developed by other countries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: 全能银行对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。在欧洲，它成为主流金融机构模式；在美国，《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》曾限制其发展，但1999年《金融服务现代化法案》的通过使其重新崛起。在中国，随着金融改革的深入，全能银行的理念逐渐被引入并实践。  
  **English Explanation**: Universal Banking has had a profound impact on the global financial system. In Europe, it became the dominant model for financial institutions; in the U.S., its development was restricted by the Glass-Steagall Act until the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 allowed its resurgence. In China, with deepening financial reforms, the concept of Universal Banking has gradually been introduced and practiced.
