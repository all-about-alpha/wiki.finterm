## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **中文起源**  
  资金不足的养老金计划问题在20世纪70年代开始显现，当时许多企业开始设立固定收益型养老金计划。随着人口老龄化和经济波动，养老金负债逐渐累积，资金不足问题日益严重。2000年后，全球金融危机和低利率环境进一步加剧了这一现象。  
  **English Origin**  
  The issue of underfunded pension plans began to emerge in the 1970s when many companies established defined benefit pension plans. With population aging and economic fluctuations, pension liabilities gradually accumulated, leading to increasing underfunding. After 2000, the global financial crisis and low-interest-rate environments further exacerbated this phenomenon.
