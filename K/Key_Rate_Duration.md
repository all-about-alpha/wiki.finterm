# Key Rate Duration

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：关键利率久期（Key Rate Duration）是衡量债券或债券组合对特定关键利率变动的敏感性的指标。它由Thomas Ho和Sang Bin Lee于1986年提出，核心概念是通过分解收益率曲线，分析不同期限的利率变动对债券价格的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Key Rate Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond or bond portfolio to changes in specific key interest rates. It was introduced by Thomas Ho and Sang Bin Lee in 1986, with the core concept of decomposing the yield curve to analyze the impact of interest rate changes at different maturities on bond prices.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：关键利率久期广泛应用于债券投资组合管理、风险对冲和资产负债匹配等领域。投资者通过计算不同关键利率的久期，可以更精确地管理利率风险，避免因收益率曲线非平行移动导致的损失。需要注意的是，该指标假设其他条件不变，实际应用中需结合市场环境综合判断。  
  **English Explanation**: Key Rate Duration is widely used in bond portfolio management, risk hedging, and asset-liability matching. By calculating the duration for different key rates, investors can more precisely manage interest rate risk and avoid losses caused by non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. It is important to note that this metric assumes other factors remain constant, so practical applications require comprehensive judgment based on market conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，关键利率久期是评估和管理利率风险的重要工具。它帮助投资者识别收益率曲线不同部分的波动对投资组合的影响，提升风险管理能力。在金融监管中，该指标也被用于评估金融机构的利率风险敞口。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Key Rate Duration is a crucial tool for assessing and managing interest rate risk. It helps investors identify the impact of fluctuations in different parts of the yield curve on their portfolios, enhancing risk management capabilities. In financial regulation, this metric is also used to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure of financial institutions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：关键利率久期的概念由Thomas Ho和Sang Bin Lee于1986年首次提出。当时，传统的久期模型无法有效应对收益率曲线的非平行移动问题，Ho和Lee通过分解收益率曲线并引入关键利率久期，填补了这一理论空白。这一方法迅速被学术界和业界采纳并广泛应用。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Key Rate Duration was first introduced by Thomas Ho and Sang Bin Lee in 1986. At that time, traditional duration models were unable to effectively address non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. Ho and Lee filled this theoretical gap by decomposing the yield curve and introducing Key Rate Duration. This method was quickly adopted and widely applied in both academia and industry.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：关键利率久期的提出对金融行业产生了深远影响。它不仅完善了债券定价和风险管理理论，还为金融机构提供了更精细化的风险管理工具。目前，该指标已成为全球固定收益投资领域的重要分析工具之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The introduction of Key Rate Duration has had a profound impact on the financial industry. It not only refined bond pricing and risk management theories but also provided financial institutions with more sophisticated risk management tools. Today, this metric has become one of the essential analytical tools in global fixed-income investment.
