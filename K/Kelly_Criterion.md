# Kelly Criterion

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：凯利准则（Kelly Criterion）是由约翰·凯利（John L. Kelly Jr.）于1956年提出的一种数学公式，用于确定在重复赌博或投资中每次应投入的最佳资金比例，以最大化长期财富增长。其核心概念是通过平衡风险和回报，找到最优的下注或投资比例。  
  **English Explanation**: The Kelly Criterion, developed by John L. Kelly Jr. in 1956, is a mathematical formula used to determine the optimal fraction of capital to allocate in repeated bets or investments to maximize long-term wealth growth. Its core concept is to balance risk and reward by identifying the ideal proportion for betting or investing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：凯利准则广泛应用于投资组合管理、赌博策略和风险管理等领域。例如，投资者可以使用它来确定股票或期货的仓位大小。然而，该准则假设已知准确的胜率和赔率，实际应用中需谨慎对待不确定性风险。过度依赖凯利准则可能导致极端仓位分配，增加破产风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The Kelly Criterion is widely applied in portfolio management, gambling strategies, and risk management. For instance, investors use it to determine position sizes for stocks or futures. However, the criterion assumes accurate knowledge of win probabilities and payouts, making it essential to handle uncertainties cautiously in practice. Over-reliance on the Kelly Criterion can lead to extreme position allocations and increased risk of ruin.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从投资和行业角度来看，凯利准则为优化资金分配提供了科学依据，帮助投资者在长期中实现财富最大化。同时，它也是风险管理的重要工具之一。然而，由于其理论假设较强，实际应用中需结合其他策略和工具以降低风险。  
  **English Explanation**: From an investment and industry perspective, the Kelly Criterion provides a scientific basis for optimizing capital allocation, helping investors maximize long-term wealth growth. It is also a crucial tool in risk management. However, due to its strong theoretical assumptions, it should be combined with other strategies and tools in practice to mitigate risks.
