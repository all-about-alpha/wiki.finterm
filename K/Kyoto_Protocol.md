# Kyoto Protocol

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  《京都议定书》是1997年在日本京都通过的具有法律约束力的国际协议，旨在通过减少温室气体排放来应对全球气候变化。它是《联合国气候变化框架公约》（UNFCCC）的补充协议，首次为发达国家设定了具有法律约束力的减排目标。  
  The Kyoto Protocol is a legally binding international agreement adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, aimed at combating global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is a supplementary agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the first to set legally binding emission reduction targets for developed countries.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在应用方面，《京都议定书》要求发达国家采取具体措施减少碳排放，如推广清洁能源、提高能源效率等。发展中国家则通过清洁发展机制（CDM）参与减排项目，获得技术和资金支持。需要注意的是，部分国家因经济或政治原因未能履行承诺，导致协议效果受限。  
  In application, the Kyoto Protocol requires developed countries to take specific measures to reduce carbon emissions, such as promoting clean energy and improving energy efficiency. Developing countries participate in emission reduction projects through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), gaining technical and financial support. However, some countries failed to fulfill their commitments due to economic or political reasons, limiting the protocol's effectiveness.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  《京都议定书》是全球气候治理的重要里程碑，标志着国际社会首次共同应对气候变化的决心。它为后续气候协议（如《巴黎协定》）奠定了基础，推动了全球绿色经济和低碳技术的发展。从投资和产业角度看，它促进了可再生能源和环保技术的市场增长。  
  The Kyoto Protocol is a significant milestone in global climate governance, marking the international community's first collective commitment to addressing climate change. It laid the foundation for subsequent climate agreements (e.g., the Paris Agreement) and spurred the development of green economies and low-carbon technologies globally. From an investment and industry perspective, it has driven market growth in renewable energy and environmental technologies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  《京都议定书》的起源可追溯到1992年通过的《联合国气候变化框架公约》。1997年12月，160多个国家在日本京都召开第三次缔约方会议（COP3），经过激烈谈判最终达成协议。2005年2月16日，《京都议定书》正式生效。中国作为发展中国家参与了谈判并签署了协议，但未承担强制性减排义务。  
  The origin of the Kyoto Protocol can be traced back to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in 1992. In December 1997, over 160 countries convened at the third Conference of the Parties (COP3) in Kyoto, Japan, where intense negotiations led to its adoption. The protocol officially entered into force on February 16, 2005. China participated in the negotiations as a developing country and signed the agreement but was not subject to mandatory emission reduction obligations.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  自生效以来，《京都议定书》推动了全球范围内的碳交易市场和清洁能源投资的发展。然而，由于美国退出和部分国家未能履行承诺，其实际减排效果受到质疑。《巴黎协定》的签署标志着全球气候治理进入新阶段，《京都议定书》的历史作用依然不可忽视。  
  Since its entry into force, the Kyoto Protocol has spurred the development of global carbon trading markets and investments in clean energy. However, its actual emission reduction effectiveness has been questioned due to the withdrawal of the United States and non-compliance by some countries. The signing of the Paris Agreement marked a new phase in global climate governance, yet the historical role of the Kyoto Protocol remains significant.
