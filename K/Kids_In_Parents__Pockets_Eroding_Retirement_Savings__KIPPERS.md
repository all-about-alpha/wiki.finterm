# Kids In Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings (KIPPERS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：KIPPERS（Kids In Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings）是指成年子女长期依赖父母经济支持，导致父母退休储蓄被侵蚀的现象。这一概念由英国社会学家在20世纪末提出，核心在于描述代际经济依赖对家庭财务规划的负面影响。  
  **English Explanation**: KIPPERS (Kids In Parents' Pockets Eroding Retirement Savings) refers to the phenomenon where adult children rely on their parents for financial support over an extended period, thereby eroding the parents' retirement savings. This concept was introduced by British sociologists in the late 20th century, highlighting the negative impact of intergenerational financial dependency on family financial planning.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在中国，随着房价上涨和生活成本增加，许多年轻人选择与父母同住或依赖父母的经济支持，导致父母的退休储蓄被消耗。这种现象在城市化进程加快的地区尤为明显。风险在于父母可能面临退休后经济压力增大，甚至无法维持基本生活水平。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: In China, with rising housing prices and living costs, many young adults choose to live with their parents or rely on their financial support, leading to the depletion of their parents' retirement savings. This phenomenon is particularly evident in rapidly urbanizing areas. The risk lies in increased financial pressure on parents post-retirement, potentially jeopardizing their basic living standards.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管和投资角度看，KIPPERS现象提醒政策制定者关注代际经济依赖问题，制定相应政策以减轻家庭负担。从行业角度看，金融机构需开发更多针对中老年人群的理财产品和退休规划服务。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory and investment perspective, the KIPPERS phenomenon alerts policymakers to address intergenerational financial dependency issues and formulate policies to alleviate family burdens. From an industry standpoint, financial institutions need to develop more wealth management products and retirement planning services tailored for middle-aged and elderly populations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：KIPPERS概念起源于20世纪90年代的英国，当时社会学家观察到越来越多的成年子女因经济压力选择与父母同住或依赖其支持。这一现象在2008年全球金融危机后进一步加剧，成为全球性社会问题。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of KIPPERS originated in the UK during the 1990s when sociologists observed a growing number of adult children choosing to live with or rely on their parents due to economic pressures. This phenomenon intensified after the global financial crisis of 2008, becoming a worldwide social issue.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：KIPPERS现象对中国家庭结构和社会经济产生了深远影响。随着独生子女政策的实施和老龄化加剧，许多家庭面临“421”结构（四个老人、两个成年人、一个孩子），父母的退休储蓄压力进一步加大。目前，这一问题已成为中国社会保障体系改革的重要议题之一。  
  **English Impact**: The KIPPERS phenomenon has had a profound impact on Chinese family structures and socioeconomics. With the implementation of the one-child policy and an aging population, many families face a "4-2-1" structure (four grandparents, two parents, one child), further increasing pressure on parental retirement savings. Currently, this issue has become a key topic in China's social security system reform.
