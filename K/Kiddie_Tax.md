# Kiddie Tax

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Kiddie Tax（儿童税）是美国税法中的一项规定，旨在防止高收入家庭通过将投资收益转移给未成年子女来避税。该税种主要针对未满19岁（或全职学生未满24岁）的未成年人，对其非劳动所得（如利息、股息和资本收益）按照父母的边际税率征税。这一规定最初由美国国会在1986年引入，目的是堵塞税收漏洞。  
  **English Explanation**: The Kiddie Tax is a provision in the U.S. tax code designed to prevent high-income families from avoiding taxes by shifting investment income to their minor children. It primarily targets unearned income (such as interest, dividends, and capital gains) of children under the age of 19 (or full-time students under 24), taxing it at their parents' marginal tax rate. This rule was first introduced by Congress in 1986 to close a tax loophole.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Kiddie Tax适用于那些通过信托、赠与或其他方式将资产转移给未成年子女的家庭。例如，父母将股票或债券赠予孩子，孩子因此获得的投资收益可能被征收Kiddie Tax。需要注意的是，该税种不适用于劳动所得（如工资或薪水）。  
  **English Application**: The Kiddie Tax applies to families who transfer assets to their minor children through trusts, gifts, or other means. For example, if parents gift stocks or bonds to their child, the investment income generated may be subject to the Kiddie Tax. It is important to note that this tax does not apply to earned income (such as wages or salaries).

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：Kiddie Tax在税务监管中具有重要意义，它有效防止了高收入家庭通过转移资产来规避税收的行为，确保了税收公平性。从投资和行业角度来看，这一规定也促使家庭在规划财务时更加谨慎，避免因不当操作而增加税务负担。  
  **English Significance**: The Kiddie Tax plays a crucial role in tax regulation by effectively preventing high-income families from avoiding taxes through asset transfers, ensuring tax fairness. From an investment and industry perspective, this rule encourages families to plan their finances more carefully to avoid unnecessary tax burdens.
