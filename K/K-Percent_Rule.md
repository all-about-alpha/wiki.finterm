## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  K百分比规则（K-Percent Rule）是由经济学家米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）提出的一种货币政策规则。其核心概念是中央银行应按照一个固定的百分比（K）来增加货币供应量，通常与经济增长率或潜在产出增长率保持一致，以维持物价稳定和经济平稳增长。  
  The K-Percent Rule, proposed by economist Milton Friedman, is a monetary policy rule suggesting that central banks should increase the money supply at a fixed percentage rate (K), typically aligned with economic growth or potential output growth, to maintain price stability and steady economic expansion.

* **应用 / Application**  
  该规则主要应用于货币政策制定中，旨在通过稳定的货币供应增长避免通货膨胀或通货紧缩。然而，其应用可能面临经济波动、外部冲击等挑战，需结合实际情况灵活调整。  
  This rule is primarily applied in monetary policy formulation to avoid inflation or deflation through stable money supply growth. However, its application may face challenges such as economic fluctuations and external shocks, requiring flexible adjustments based on actual conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，K百分比规则为货币政策提供了透明且可预测的框架；从投资角度看，它有助于降低市场不确定性；从行业角度看，稳定的货币环境有利于企业长期规划和发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the K-Percent Rule provides a transparent and predictable framework for monetary policy; from an investment perspective, it helps reduce market uncertainty; from an industry perspective, a stable monetary environment supports long-term planning and development.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  20世纪60年代，米尔顿·弗里德曼在批判凯恩斯主义货币政策的基础上提出了K百分比规则。他认为固定货币供应增长率比频繁调整利率更能有效控制通货膨胀和经济波动。这一理论成为现代货币主义的重要基石之一。  
  In the 1960s, Milton Friedman proposed the K-Percent Rule as a critique of Keynesian monetary policy. He argued that a fixed rate of money supply growth was more effective than frequent interest rate adjustments in controlling inflation and economic fluctuations. This theory became one of the cornerstones of modern monetarism.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  K百分比规则对全球货币政策产生了深远影响，尤其是在20世纪70年代高通胀时期被广泛讨论和应用。尽管其实践中存在争议，但其强调的货币供应稳定性理念至今仍被许多国家和经济学家借鉴。  
  The K-Percent Rule has had a profound impact on global monetary policy, particularly during the high inflation period of the 1970s when it was widely discussed and applied. Despite controversies in practice, its emphasis on money supply stability continues to influence many countries and economists today.
