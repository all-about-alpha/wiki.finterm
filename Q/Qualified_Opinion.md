* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  保留意见（Qualified Opinion）是审计师在审计报告中发表的一种意见类型，表示财务报表整体上是公允的，但存在某些特定事项或限制，导致审计师无法对某些部分发表无保留意见。这些事项可能包括财务报表中的重大错报、审计范围受限或会计政策的不一致等。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Qualified Opinion is a type of opinion expressed by an auditor in an audit report, indicating that the financial statements are fairly presented overall, but there are specific issues or limitations that prevent the auditor from issuing an unqualified opinion. These issues may include material misstatements in the financial statements, limitations on the scope of the audit, or inconsistencies in accounting policies.
