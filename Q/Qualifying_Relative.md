# Qualifying Relative

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：合格亲属（Qualifying Relative）是美国税法中的一个术语，指纳税人可以为其申报税收减免的特定亲属。根据美国国税局（IRS）的规定，合格亲属必须满足一定的条件，例如与纳税人同住、收入低于特定标准、且纳税人需为其提供超过一半的经济支持。  
  **English Explanation**: A Qualifying Relative is a term in U.S. tax law referring to a specific relative for whom a taxpayer can claim a tax exemption. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a Qualifying Relative must meet certain criteria, such as living with the taxpayer, having income below a specified threshold, and receiving more than half of their financial support from the taxpayer.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在申报个人所得税时，纳税人可以为符合资格的家庭成员（如父母、兄弟姐妹等）申请税收减免。需要注意的是，合格亲属的定义不包括配偶和子女，因为他们通常通过其他税收条款进行申报。此外，纳税人需确保所申报的亲属完全符合IRS的条件，以避免税务审计风险。  
  **English Application**: When filing individual income taxes, taxpayers can claim exemptions for eligible family members (e.g., parents, siblings) who meet the criteria. It is important to note that spouses and children are not included in this definition, as they are typically claimed under other tax provisions. Taxpayers must ensure that the claimed relative fully meets IRS requirements to avoid audit risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从税务规划的角度来看，合格亲属条款为纳税人提供了额外的税收减免机会，有助于降低整体税负。对于有经济依赖关系的家庭而言，这一条款尤为重要。同时，IRS对合格亲属的严格定义也确保了税收制度的公平性和透明度。  
  **English Significance**: From a tax planning perspective, the Qualifying Relative provision offers taxpayers additional opportunities for tax exemptions, helping to reduce overall tax liability. This provision is particularly important for families with financial dependents. Additionally, the IRS's strict definition ensures fairness and transparency in the tax system.
