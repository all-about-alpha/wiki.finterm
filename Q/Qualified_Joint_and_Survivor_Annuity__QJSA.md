# Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 合格联合生存者年金（QJSA）是一种退休金计划，通常由雇主提供，确保参与者在退休后与其配偶共同享有终身收入。根据美国《雇员退休收入保障法》（ERISA），QJSA是默认的退休金支付方式，除非参与者选择其他形式。其核心概念是保障参与者和其配偶的长期财务安全。  
  **English Explanation**: A Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA) is a type of retirement plan typically offered by employers, ensuring that participants and their spouses receive lifetime income after retirement. Under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), QJSA is the default payment method for retirement benefits unless the participant opts for an alternative. Its core concept is to provide long-term financial security for both the participant and their spouse.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: QJSA主要应用于企业退休金计划中，特别是在参与者已婚的情况下。它为夫妻双方提供终身收入保障，但需注意，选择QJSA可能会降低单月支付金额，因为年金需要覆盖两个人的寿命。此外，参与者需在退休前明确选择是否接受QJSA或选择其他支付方式。  
  **English Explanation**: QJSA is primarily used in employer-sponsored retirement plans, especially when the participant is married. It provides lifetime income security for both spouses, but it’s important to note that choosing QJSA may reduce the monthly payment amount since the annuity must cover two lifetimes. Additionally, participants must decide before retirement whether to accept QJSA or opt for an alternative payment method.
