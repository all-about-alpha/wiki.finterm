## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文历史背景**：准公共公司的概念起源于20世纪初的欧美国家，当时政府为应对经济危机和战争需求，开始介入私营企业运营。例如，美国在二战期间成立的战时生产委员会（War Production Board）就是典型的准公共机构。中国在改革开放后也逐步引入这一模式，以推动关键领域的市场化改革。  
  **English Historical Background**: The concept of Quasi-Public Corporations originated in Europe and the United States in the early 20th century when governments began intervening in private enterprises to address economic crises and wartime needs. For example, the War Production Board established by the U.S. during World War II was a typical quasi-public institution. China gradually adopted this model after its reform and opening-up to promote market-oriented reforms in key sectors.
