# Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：合格个人住宅信托（Qualified Personal Residence Trust, QPRT）是一种美国税法允许的信托工具，允许个人将自住住宅或度假屋转移至信托中，同时保留在特定期限内继续居住的权利。通过这种方式，个人可以在未来将房产以较低的价值转移给受益人，从而减少赠与税或遗产税的负担。  
  **English Explanation**: A Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT) is a trust instrument permitted under U.S. tax law that allows an individual to transfer their primary residence or vacation home into a trust while retaining the right to live in the property for a specified period. This mechanism enables the individual to transfer the property to beneficiaries at a reduced value in the future, thereby minimizing gift or estate tax liabilities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：QPRT通常用于高净值人士的遗产规划中，特别是那些希望将房产转移给子女或其他继承人的人。通过设立QPRT，委托人可以在信托期限内继续居住在该房产中，而无需支付租金。然而，如果委托人在信托期限结束前去世，房产将被纳入其遗产并可能面临较高的遗产税。此外，QPRT的设立需要严格遵守税法规定，否则可能导致税务风险。  
  **English Explanation**: QPRTs are commonly used in estate planning by high-net-worth individuals, particularly those who wish to transfer property to their children or other heirs. By establishing a QPRT, the grantor can continue to reside in the property during the trust term without paying rent. However, if the grantor passes away before the trust term ends, the property will be included in their estate and may be subject to higher estate taxes. Additionally, setting up a QPRT requires strict adherence to tax regulations; otherwise, it may lead to tax risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从税务规划的角度来看，QPRT是一种有效的工具，可以帮助个人减少赠与税和遗产税的负担。它允许委托人以较低的价值将房产转移给受益人，从而在长期内节省大量税款。此外，QPRT的使用也反映了美国税法在鼓励财产传承方面的灵活性。然而，由于其复杂性，建议在设立QPRT时咨询专业的税务和法律顾问。  
  **English Explanation**: From a tax planning perspective, QPRTs are an effective tool for reducing gift and estate tax liabilities. They allow grantors to transfer property to beneficiaries at a reduced value, resulting in significant long-term tax savings. Additionally, the use of QPRTs reflects the flexibility of U.S. tax law in encouraging property succession. However, due to their complexity, it is advisable to consult professional tax and legal advisors when establishing a QPRT.
