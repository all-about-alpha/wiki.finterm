# Q Ratio (Tobin's Q)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：托宾Q比率（Tobin's Q Ratio）是由诺贝尔经济学奖得主詹姆斯·托宾（James Tobin）提出的一种衡量企业市场价值与其资产重置成本之间关系的指标。其核心公式为：Q = 企业市场价值 / 资产重置成本。当Q > 1时，表明企业市场价值高于其资产重置成本，可能意味着企业具有较高的投资价值或市场溢价；当Q < 1时，则表明企业市场价值低于其资产重置成本，可能暗示企业被低估或存在投资风险。  
  - **English Explanation**: The Q Ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, is a metric developed by Nobel laureate James Tobin to measure the relationship between a firm's market value and the replacement cost of its assets. The core formula is: Q = Market Value of the Firm / Replacement Cost of Assets. When Q > 1, it indicates that the firm's market value exceeds the replacement cost of its assets, suggesting potential investment value or market premium. When Q < 1, it implies that the firm's market value is below the replacement cost of its assets, signaling potential undervaluation or investment risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：托宾Q比率广泛应用于企业估值、投资决策和并购分析中。投资者常用其判断股票是否被高估或低估，企业管理者则利用其评估资产配置效率。需要注意的是，该指标依赖于市场价值的波动性和资产重置成本的估算准确性，因此在市场剧烈波动或资产价值难以评估时，其应用可能受限。  
  - **English Application**: Tobin's Q Ratio is widely used in corporate valuation, investment decision-making, and merger and acquisition analysis. Investors often use it to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued, while corporate managers utilize it to assess the efficiency of asset allocation. It is important to note that this metric relies on the volatility of market value and the accuracy of estimating replacement costs, which may limit its applicability during periods of significant market fluctuations or when asset values are difficult to assess.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，托宾Q比率有助于评估企业资产配置的合理性；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了判断市场估值的重要工具；从行业角度看，该指标能够反映行业整体的投资热度与资产效率。  
  - **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Tobin's Q Ratio helps assess the rationality of corporate asset allocation. From an investment perspective, it provides investors with a critical tool for evaluating market valuations. From an industry perspective, this metric reflects the overall investment enthusiasm and asset efficiency within a sector.
