# Quoted Price

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：报价（Quoted Price）是指在金融市场中，卖方或买方对某一金融资产（如股票、债券、商品等）提出的买卖价格。通常包括买入价（Bid Price）和卖出价（Ask Price），两者之间的差额称为买卖价差（Bid-Ask Spread）。报价是市场参与者进行交易的基础，反映了市场对该资产的即时估值。  
  **English Explanation**: The quoted price refers to the price at which a financial asset (such as stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.) is offered for sale or purchase in the financial market. It typically includes the bid price (the price a buyer is willing to pay) and the ask price (the price a seller is willing to accept). The difference between these two prices is known as the bid-ask spread. The quoted price serves as the foundation for market participants to conduct transactions and reflects the market's immediate valuation of the asset.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：报价广泛应用于股票市场、外汇市场、期货市场等金融交易场所。投资者根据报价决定是否买入或卖出资产。需要注意的是，报价可能因市场流动性、交易量等因素而波动，投资者应关注买卖价差以评估交易成本。  
  **English Application**: Quoted prices are widely used in financial trading venues such as stock markets, forex markets, and futures markets. Investors decide whether to buy or sell assets based on these prices. It is important to note that quoted prices can fluctuate due to factors like market liquidity and trading volume. Investors should pay attention to the bid-ask spread to assess transaction costs.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，透明的报价有助于维护市场公平性和效率；从投资角度看，准确的报价是投资者决策的重要依据；从行业角度看，稳定的报价体系是金融市场健康运行的基础。

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：报价的概念可以追溯到17世纪的阿姆斯特丹证券交易所，这是世界上第一个正式的股票交易所。当时，商人们通过公开喊价的方式确定股票价格，形成了最早的报价机制。随着金融市场的发展，电子化交易系统逐渐取代了传统的喊价方式，但报价的核心功能未变。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of quoted prices dates back to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in the 17th century, the world's first formal stock exchange. At that time, merchants determined stock prices through open outcry, forming the earliest quoting mechanism. With the development of financial markets, electronic trading systems gradually replaced traditional outcry methods, but the core function of quoting remains unchanged.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：报价机制的完善极大地提高了金融市场的透明度和效率。现代金融市场中，实时电子报价已成为全球交易的标配，促进了资本流动和国际投资。然而，高频交易和算法交易的兴起也对传统报价模式提出了挑战。  
  **English Impact**: The refinement of quoting mechanisms has significantly enhanced transparency and efficiency in financial markets. In modern financial markets, real-time electronic quotes have become standard for global trading, facilitating capital flows and international investments.
