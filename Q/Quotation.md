# Quotation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：报价（Quotation）是指在金融市场中，交易双方对某一金融工具（如股票、债券、外汇等）的买卖价格进行确认的过程。通常包括买入价（Bid Price）和卖出价（Ask Price），两者之间的差额称为点差（Spread）。报价是市场参与者进行交易的基础，反映了市场对该金融工具的即时估值。  
  **English Explanation**: A quotation in financial markets refers to the process by which buyers and sellers confirm the price of a financial instrument (such as stocks, bonds, or foreign exchange). It typically includes the bid price (the price at which buyers are willing to purchase) and the ask price (the price at which sellers are willing to sell), with the difference between the two known as the spread. Quotations form the basis for market transactions and reflect the immediate market valuation of the instrument.
