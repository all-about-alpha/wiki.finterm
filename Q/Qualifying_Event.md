## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

  合格事件（Qualifying Event）是指在特定条件下触发某种权利或义务的事件，通常用于保险、税务或员工福利等领域。例如，在健康保险中，合格事件可能包括结婚、离婚、生育或失业等，这些事件允许个人在非开放注册期更改或申请保险计划。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Qualifying Event is an event that triggers certain rights or obligations under specific conditions, commonly used in insurance, taxation, or employee benefits. For example, in health insurance, qualifying events may include marriage, divorce, childbirth, or job loss, which allow individuals to change or apply for insurance plans outside the open enrollment period.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  在健康保险中，合格事件允许个人在特定情况下调整保险计划。例如，员工在失业后可以通过COBRA法案继续享受雇主提供的健康保险。此外，家庭结构变化（如结婚或生育）也可能触发保险计划的变更。需要注意的是，不同保险公司对合格事件的定义可能有所不同，需仔细阅读条款。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  In health insurance, qualifying events enable individuals to adjust their insurance plans under specific circumstances. For instance, employees who lose their jobs can continue their employer-provided health insurance through the COBRA Act. Additionally, changes in family structure (e.g., marriage or childbirth) may also trigger adjustments to insurance plans. It is important to note that definitions of qualifying events may vary among insurers, so careful review of terms is necessary.

As social security systems evolved, the scope and definitions of qualifying events have also been updated.
