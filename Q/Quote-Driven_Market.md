# Quote-Driven Market

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：报价驱动市场（Quote-Driven Market）是一种金融市场交易机制，其中做市商（Market Makers）通过提供买卖报价来为市场提供流动性。在这种市场中，做市商承担了买卖双方的角色，投资者通过与做市商交易来完成买卖操作。这种机制常见于外汇市场和某些股票市场。  
  **English Explanation**: A quote-driven market is a financial market mechanism where market makers provide liquidity by offering bid and ask prices. In this market, market makers act as both buyers and sellers, and investors execute trades by dealing directly with the market makers. This mechanism is commonly seen in foreign exchange markets and certain stock markets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：报价驱动市场广泛应用于外汇市场、债券市场和部分股票市场。在这种市场中，做市商通过不断调整报价来反映市场供需变化，从而确保市场的流动性。然而，投资者需注意做市商的报价可能包含价差（Spread），这会影响交易成本。此外，做市商的信用风险也是需要考虑的因素。  
  **English Explanation**: Quote-driven markets are widely used in foreign exchange markets, bond markets, and certain stock markets. In these markets, market makers continuously adjust their quotes to reflect changes in supply and demand, ensuring market liquidity. However, investors should be aware that the quotes provided by market makers may include a spread, which can affect transaction costs. Additionally, the credit risk of market makers is a factor to consider.

  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, quote-driven markets help maintain liquidity and stability, especially in low-liquidity markets.
