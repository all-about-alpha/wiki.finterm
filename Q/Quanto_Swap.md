# Quanto Swap

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Quanto Swap（跨币种互换）是一种金融衍生品，允许交易双方在两种不同货币之间进行现金流交换，但其中一方的现金流以固定汇率转换为另一种货币。这种工具通常用于对冲汇率风险，同时保留对标的资产（如利率或股票指数）的敞口。其核心概念在于将汇率风险与标的资产风险分离。  
  **English Explanation**: A Quanto Swap is a financial derivative that allows two parties to exchange cash flows in two different currencies, with one party's cash flows converted into another currency at a fixed exchange rate. This instrument is commonly used to hedge currency risk while maintaining exposure to the underlying asset (such as interest rates or stock indices). The core concept lies in decoupling currency risk from the underlying asset risk.
