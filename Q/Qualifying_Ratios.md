# Qualifying Ratios

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 合格比率（Qualifying Ratios）是金融机构在评估借款人贷款资格时使用的一组财务指标，主要用于衡量借款人的债务负担能力和还款能力。常见的合格比率包括债务收入比（DTI）和住房支出收入比（Housing Expense Ratio）。这些比率帮助贷款机构判断借款人是否有足够的收入来覆盖其债务和住房支出。  
  **English Explanation**: Qualifying Ratios are a set of financial metrics used by financial institutions to assess a borrower's eligibility for a loan, primarily measuring the borrower's debt burden and repayment capacity. Common qualifying ratios include the Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) and the Housing Expense Ratio. These ratios help lenders determine whether the borrower has sufficient income to cover their debts and housing expenses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 合格比率广泛应用于个人住房贷款、汽车贷款和其他消费贷款的审批过程中。例如，银行在审批房贷时，会计算借款人的债务收入比，确保其月供不超过收入的特定比例（如30%）。此外，这些比率也用于评估借款人的财务健康状况，帮助金融机构降低违约风险。  
  **English Application**: Qualifying ratios are widely used in the approval process for personal mortgages, auto loans, and other consumer loans. For example, when approving a mortgage, banks calculate the borrower's debt-to-income ratio to ensure that monthly payments do not exceed a certain percentage of income (e.g., 30%). Additionally, these ratios are used to assess the borrower's financial health, helping financial institutions mitigate default risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，合格比率是确保金融系统稳定性的重要工具，防止过度借贷和系统性风险。从投资角度看，这些指标帮助投资者评估贷款组合的质量。从行业角度看，它们为金融机构提供了标准化的风险评估框架，促进了公平竞争和透明操作。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, qualifying ratios are crucial tools for ensuring financial system stability by preventing over-leveraging and systemic risks. From an investment standpoint, these metrics help investors assess the quality of loan portfolios. From an industry perspective, they provide financial institutions with a standardized framework for risk assessment, promoting fair competition and transparent operations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 合格比率的起源可以追溯到20世纪中期美国住房贷款市场的规范化发展。随着二战后住房需求的激增，金融机构开始采用更科学的评估方法来确定借款人的还款能力。1970年代，《社区再投资法》（CRA）的出台进一步推动了合格比率的标准化应用。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of qualifying ratios can be traced back to the standardization of the U.S. housing loan market in the mid-20th century. With the surge in housing demand after World War II, financial institutions began adopting more scientific methods to assess borrowers' repayment capacity. The enactment of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in the 1970s further promoted the standardized application of qualifying ratios.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: 合格比率的引入显著提高了贷款审批的科学性和公平性，降低了金融机构的坏账率。然而，2008年金融危机暴露了某些情况下这些比率的局限性，促使监管机构进一步完善相关标准。目前，合格比率已成为全球金融行业的重要风险管理工具之一。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of qualifying ratios significantly improved the scientific rigor and fairness of loan approvals while reducing bad debt rates for financial institutions. However, the limitations of these ratios were exposed during the 2008 financial crisis, prompting regulators to refine related standards further. Today, qualifying ratios have become one of the essential risk management tools in the global financial industry.
