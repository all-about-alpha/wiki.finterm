# Qualification Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资格比率（Qualification Ratio）是指金融机构在评估借款人信用风险时，用于衡量借款人是否符合贷款条件的一个关键指标。它通常基于借款人的收入、债务水平、信用历史等因素计算得出，用于判断借款人是否有能力按时偿还贷款。这一比率的核心概念是确保借款人的财务健康状况能够满足贷款机构的要求。  
  **English Explanation**: The Qualification Ratio is a key metric used by financial institutions to assess a borrower's credit risk and determine whether they meet the criteria for a loan. It is typically calculated based on factors such as the borrower's income, debt levels, and credit history, and is used to evaluate the borrower's ability to repay the loan on time. The core concept of this ratio is to ensure that the borrower's financial health meets the lender's requirements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：资格比率广泛应用于个人贷款、抵押贷款和商业贷款等场景。例如，在申请住房贷款时，银行会计算借款人的债务收入比（DTI），以确定其是否有资格获得贷款。风险方面，如果资格比率过高，可能意味着借款人负债过重，违约风险较大。

For example, when applying for a home loan, banks calculate the borrower's Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio to determine their eligibility. From a risk perspective, a high Qualification Ratio may indicate that the borrower is over-leveraged, increasing the risk of default.
