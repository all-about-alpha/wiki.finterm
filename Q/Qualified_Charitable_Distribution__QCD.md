# Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：合格慈善分配（Qualified Charitable Distribution, QCD）是指年满70½岁的个人从其个人退休账户（IRA）中直接向符合条件的慈善机构进行分配的一种方式。这种分配不计入纳税人的应税收入，从而可以降低其税务负担。QCD的金额上限为每年10万美元，且必须直接从IRA账户转入慈善机构。  
  **English Explanation**: A Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) is a distribution from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) made directly to a qualified charity by an individual aged 70½ or older. This distribution is excluded from the taxpayer's taxable income, thereby reducing their tax liability. The maximum amount for a QCD is $100,000 per year, and it must be transferred directly from the IRA to the charity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：QCD主要适用于那些希望减少应税收入并支持慈善事业的退休人士。例如，一位年满70½岁的退休者可以通过QCD将其IRA中的部分资金直接捐赠给慈善机构，从而避免这部分资金被计入其应税收入。需要注意的是，QDC必须直接从IRA账户转入慈善机构，且捐赠金额不得超过10万美元。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: QCDs are primarily used by retirees who wish to reduce their taxable income while supporting charitable causes. For instance, a retiree aged 70½ or older can use a QCD to donate part of their IRA funds directly to a charity, thereby avoiding the inclusion of these funds in their taxable income. It is important to note that QDCs must be transferred directly from the IRA account to the charity, and the donation amount cannot exceed $100,000.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从税务角度来看，QDC为高收入退休人士提供了一种有效的税务规划工具，帮助他们降低应税收入并支持公益事业。从行业角度来看，QDC促进了慈善事业的发展，同时也鼓励了更多人参与公益捐赠。监管方面，QDC的设立体现了政府对公益事业的支持和对税收优惠政策的合理运用。  
  **English Significance**: From a tax perspective, QDCs provide an effective tax planning tool for high-income retirees, helping them reduce taxable income while supporting charitable causes. From an industry perspective, QDCs promote the development of charitable organizations and encourage more people to participate in philanthropic donations. In terms of regulation, the establishment of QDCs reflects government support for public welfare and the rational use of tax incentives.
