  The concept of quarterly revenue growth originated in the early 20th century during the standardization of the U.S. securities market. As the disclosure system for listed companies improved, investors began focusing on short-term financial performance, and quarterly reports gradually became an important analytical tool. After the Great Depression of 1929, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further strengthened the requirements for quarterly financial reporting.
