# Quick Liquidity Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **速动比率**，也称为酸性测试比率，是衡量企业短期偿债能力的重要财务指标。它通过比较企业的速动资产（如现金、应收账款、短期投资等）与流动负债，来评估企业在不依赖存货销售的情况下，能否迅速偿还短期债务。公式为：速动比率 = （现金 + 应收账款 + 短期投资）/ 流动负债。  
  The **Quick Liquidity Ratio**, also known as the Acid-Test Ratio, is a crucial financial metric used to assess a company's short-term liquidity. It compares a company's quick assets (such as cash, accounts receivable, and short-term investments) to its current liabilities to determine whether the company can meet its short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales. The formula is: Quick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Short-Term Investments) / Current Liabilities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在财务分析中，速动比率常用于评估企业的流动性风险。通常，速动比率大于1被视为企业具备良好的短期偿债能力；若低于1，则可能面临流动性压力。该指标特别适用于存货周转较慢或存货价值波动较大的行业，如制造业和零售业。  
  In financial analysis, the Quick Liquidity Ratio is commonly used to evaluate a company's liquidity risk. A ratio greater than 1 is generally considered indicative of strong short-term solvency, while a ratio below 1 may signal potential liquidity issues. This metric is particularly useful in industries with slow inventory turnover or significant inventory value fluctuations, such as manufacturing and retail.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，速动比率是银行和金融机构评估企业信用风险的重要工具；从投资者角度，它帮助判断企业的财务健康状况；从行业角度，它是企业优化资产结构和提高运营效率的参考依据。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Quick Liquidity Ratio is an essential tool for banks and financial institutions to assess credit risk. For investors, it helps gauge a company's financial health. From an industry standpoint, it serves as a reference for optimizing asset structures and improving operational efficiency.
