# Impairment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  减值（Impairment）是指资产的可回收金额低于其账面价值的情况。根据国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和中国企业会计准则，当资产的可回收金额（即使用价值或公允价值减去处置费用后的较高者）低于其账面价值时，企业需要确认资产减值损失。减值的核心概念包括可回收金额、账面价值和减值损失。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Impairment refers to a situation where the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount. According to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises, when the recoverable amount of an asset (the higher of its value in use or fair value less costs of disposal) is lower than its carrying amount, the company must recognize an impairment loss. The core concepts include recoverable amount, carrying amount, and impairment loss.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  减值通常应用于固定资产、无形资产、商誉以及长期股权投资等资产类别。例如，当一家企业的设备因技术过时而无法产生预期的现金流时，可能需要对该设备进行减值测试并确认减值损失。风险提示：减值测试需要依赖管理层的主观判断和未来现金流预测，可能存在操纵空间。  
  **English Application**：  
  Impairment is commonly applied to asset categories such as fixed assets, intangible assets, goodwill, and long-term equity investments. For example, if a company's equipment becomes obsolete and fails to generate expected cash flows, the company may need to perform an impairment test and recognize an impairment loss. Risk Note: Impairment testing relies on management's subjective judgment and future cash flow projections, which may leave room for manipulation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，减值有助于确保财务报表真实反映企业资产的实际价值，防止资产虚高。从投资角度看，减值损失可能影响企业的盈利能力和股价表现。从行业角度看，减值测试是评估企业资产健康状况的重要工具。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, impairment ensures that financial statements accurately reflect the true value of a company's assets, preventing overstatement. From an investment perspective, impairment losses can impact a company's profitability and stock performance. From an industry perspective, impairment testing is a critical tool for assessing the health of a company's assets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  减值概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的会计实践，但直到20世纪80年代，随着国际会计准则委员会（IASC）的成立，减值才被正式纳入会计准则。1998年，IAS 36《资产减值》发布，成为全球范围内减值会计的基准。中国企业会计准则在2006年引入减值概念，与国际准则接轨。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of impairment can be traced back to early 20th-century accounting practices, but it was not formally incorporated into accounting standards until the 1980s with the establishment of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). In 1998, IAS 36 "Impairment of Assets" was issued, becoming the global benchmark for impairment accounting. Chinese Accounting Standards introduced the concept of impairment in 2006, aligning with international standards.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  减值准则的实施对全球企业产生了深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机期间，许多企业因资产价值大幅下降而确认巨额减值损失，导致财务报表严重恶化。目前，减值测试已成为企业年度审计的重要环节，尤其是在高波动性行业如科技和能源领域。  
  **English Impact**：  
  The implementation of impairment standards has had a profound impact on global businesses. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, many companies recognized significant impairment losses due to sharp declines in asset values, leading to severe deterioration in financial statements. Today, impairment testing is a critical part of annual audits, especially in high-volatility industries like technology and energy.
