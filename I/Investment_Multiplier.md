# Investment Multiplier

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **投资乘数**是由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）提出的概念，用于描述初始投资对整体经济产出的放大效应。其核心思想是，当政府或企业增加投资时，会通过消费、生产和收入循环带动更多的经济活动，从而产生数倍于初始投资的总体经济效果。  
  The **Investment Multiplier** is a concept introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes, describing the amplifying effect of initial investment on overall economic output. The core idea is that when governments or businesses increase investment, it stimulates more economic activity through consumption, production, and income cycles, resulting in a total economic impact that is a multiple of the initial investment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，投资乘数理论被广泛应用于宏观经济政策制定中，特别是在经济刺激计划中。例如，2008年金融危机后，中国政府通过大规模基础设施投资拉动经济增长。然而，过度依赖投资乘数可能导致资源错配和债务风险。  
  In China, the Investment Multiplier theory is widely applied in macroeconomic policy-making, especially in economic stimulus plans. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese government stimulated economic growth through large-scale infrastructure investments. However, over-reliance on the Investment Multiplier may lead to resource misallocation and debt risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，理解投资乘数有助于制定更有效的财政政策；从投资者角度看，它可以帮助评估政策对市场的影响；从行业角度看，它是衡量经济活动效率的重要工具。  
  From a regulatory perspective, understanding the Investment Multiplier helps formulate more effective fiscal policies; from an investor's perspective, it aids in assessing policy impacts on markets; from an industry perspective, it is a crucial tool for measuring economic activity efficiency.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  投资乘数的概念起源于20世纪30年代的大萧条时期。凯恩斯在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中首次提出这一理论，旨在解释如何通过政府干预刺激经济复苏。这一理论成为凯恩斯主义经济学的基石之一。  
  The concept of the Investment Multiplier originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Keynes first introduced this theory in his work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money*, aiming to explain how government intervention could stimulate economic recovery. This theory became one of the cornerstones of Keynesian economics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，投资乘数理论在改革开放后的经济发展中发挥了重要作用，特别是在基础设施建设领域。目前，随着中国经济转型，该理论的应用也在不断调整以适应新的发展需求。在全球范围内，投资乘数被广泛应用于各国经济政策的制定与评估中。  
  In China, the Investment Multiplier theory played a significant role in post-reform economic development, particularly in infrastructure construction. Currently, as China's economy transitions, its application is being adjusted to meet new development needs. Globally, the Investment Multiplier is widely used in formulating and evaluating economic policies.
