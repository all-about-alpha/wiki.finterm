# Inter-Vivos Trust

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Inter-Vivos Trust，中文称为“生前信托”，是一种在委托人（即设立信托的人）在世时设立并生效的信托。与遗嘱信托不同，生前信托在委托人去世前就已经开始运作，通常用于资产管理和遗产规划。其核心概念包括委托人、受托人和受益人三方关系，以及信托财产的独立性和法律保护。  
  **English Explanation**: An Inter-Vivos Trust, also known as a "living trust," is a trust established and effective during the lifetime of the grantor (the person who creates the trust). Unlike a testamentary trust, an inter-vivos trust begins operation before the grantor's death and is commonly used for asset management and estate planning. Its core concepts include the three-party relationship of grantor, trustee, and beneficiary, as well as the independence and legal protection of trust assets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：生前信托广泛应用于个人和家庭的财富管理，特别是在高净值人群中。它可以帮助规避遗产税、简化遗产分配流程，并在委托人丧失行为能力时确保资产得到妥善管理。然而，设立生前信托需要支付一定的法律和管理费用，且其复杂性和灵活性可能带来一定的法律风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Living trusts are widely used in personal and family wealth management, especially among high-net-worth individuals. They can help avoid estate taxes, simplify the inheritance distribution process, and ensure proper asset management if the grantor becomes incapacitated. However, establishing a living trust requires certain legal and administrative fees, and its complexity and flexibility may pose legal risks.
