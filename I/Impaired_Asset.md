# Impaired Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：减值资产是指由于市场环境变化、技术过时、法律限制或其他因素，导致其未来可收回金额低于其账面价值的资产。根据国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和中国企业会计准则，企业需定期对资产进行减值测试，并在必要时确认减值损失。  
  **English Explanation**: An impaired asset is an asset whose recoverable amount has fallen below its carrying value due to changes in market conditions, technological obsolescence, legal restrictions, or other factors. According to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Chinese Accounting Standards, companies are required to conduct regular impairment tests and recognize impairment losses when necessary.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：减值资产的概念广泛应用于固定资产、无形资产和商誉等长期资产的会计处理中。例如，当一家公司的设备因技术更新而贬值，或一项专利因法律纠纷而失去价值时，这些资产可能被确认为减值资产。企业在确认减值损失时需谨慎评估未来现金流和折现率等关键参数。  
  **English Application**: The concept of impaired assets is widely applied in the accounting treatment of long-term assets such as fixed assets, intangible assets, and goodwill. For example, when a company's equipment depreciates due to technological advancements or a patent loses value due to legal disputes, these assets may be recognized as impaired. Companies must carefully evaluate key parameters such as future cash flows and discount rates when recognizing impairment losses.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，减值资产的确认有助于提高财务报表的透明度和准确性；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者识别企业的潜在风险；从行业角度看，它促使企业更合理地管理资产配置和风险控制。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, recognizing impaired assets enhances the transparency and accuracy of financial statements; from an investment perspective, it helps investors identify potential risks in companies; from an industry perspective, it encourages more rational asset allocation and risk management.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：减值资产的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的会计实践，但直到20世纪90年代国际会计准则委员会（IASC）发布相关准则后，才被广泛采用。2001年国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的推出进一步规范了减值资产的会计处理。中国企业会计准则在2006年与国际接轨后也引入了这一概念。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of impaired assets can be traced back to early 20th-century accounting practices but was not widely adopted until the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) issued relevant standards in the 1990s. The introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2001 further standardized the accounting treatment of impaired assets. Chinese Accounting Standards introduced this concept after aligning with international standards in 2006.

* **影响 / Impact**
