# Import Substitution Industrialization

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **进口替代工业化**是一种经济发展战略，旨在通过减少对进口商品的依赖，发展本国工业来生产这些商品。该战略的核心是通过关税、配额和其他贸易壁垒保护国内产业，促进本土制造业的成长。这一概念最早由拉美经济学家在20世纪中叶提出，并在许多发展中国家得到应用。  
  **Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI)** is an economic development strategy aimed at reducing dependency on imported goods by fostering domestic industries to produce these goods. The core of this strategy involves protecting domestic industries through tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers to promote the growth of local manufacturing. This concept was first proposed by Latin American economists in the mid-20th century and has been applied in many developing countries.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，进口替代工业化曾在上世纪80年代至90年代被部分采用，特别是在汽车、电子和机械制造领域。通过高关税和限制外资进入，中国成功培育了一批本土企业。然而，这一策略也带来了效率低下和技术落后的问题。  
  In China, Import Substitution Industrialization was partially adopted from the 1980s to the 1990s, particularly in industries such as automobiles, electronics, and machinery manufacturing. By imposing high tariffs and restricting foreign investment, China successfully nurtured a number of domestic enterprises. However, this strategy also led to inefficiencies and technological backwardness.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，进口替代工业化有助于保护新兴工业免受国际竞争冲击；从投资角度看，它为本土企业提供了发展机会；从行业角度看，它促进了产业链的完善和技术积累。然而，过度依赖这一策略可能导致市场封闭和创新不足。  
  From a regulatory perspective, Import Substitution Industrialization helps protect emerging industries from international competition; from an investment perspective, it provides opportunities for domestic enterprises; from an industry perspective, it promotes the improvement of industrial chains and technological accumulation. However, over-reliance on this strategy may lead to market closure and insufficient innovation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  进口替代工业化的概念起源于20世纪40年代的拉丁美洲，特别是阿根廷、巴西和墨西哥等国家。这些国家在二战后试图通过减少对发达国家的经济依赖来实现自主发展。经济学家劳尔·普雷维什（Raúl Prebisch）是这一理论的主要倡导者之一。  
  The concept of Import Substitution Industrialization originated in Latin America in the 1940s, particularly in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. These countries sought to achieve self-reliance by reducing their economic dependence on developed nations after World War II. Economist Raúl Prebisch was one of the main proponents of this theory.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在拉美国家，进口替代工业化初期取得了一定成效，推动了工业基础的建立。然而，长期实施导致生产效率低下、债务危机和经济停滞等问题。目前，许多国家已转向出口导向型战略或混合模式以平衡发展与开放的关系。  
  In Latin American countries, Import Substitution Industrialization initially achieved some success by promoting the establishment of an industrial base. However, long-term implementation led to issues such as low production efficiency, debt crises, and economic stagnation. Currently, many countries have shifted to export-oriented strategies or mixed models to balance development and openness.
