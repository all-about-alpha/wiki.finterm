## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：介绍经纪人模式起源于20世纪初的美国期货市场。当时，许多小型农场主和商人需要进入期货市场进行风险管理，但缺乏直接与大型经纪商打交道的渠道。于是，一些中间人开始充当桥梁角色，将客户介绍给主经纪商并从中获利。这一模式逐渐扩展到其他金融市场并全球化发展。  
  **English Explanation**: The Introducing Broker model originated in the early 20th century in the U.S. futures market. At that time, many small farmers and merchants needed access to futures markets for risk management but lacked direct channels to large brokers. As a result, intermediaries began acting as bridges, referring clients to primary brokers for profit. This model gradually expanded to other financial markets and developed globally.
