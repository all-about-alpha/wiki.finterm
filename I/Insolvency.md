## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  **中文解释**: 破产（Insolvency）是指企业或个人无法偿还到期债务的财务状态。通常分为两种类型：流动性破产（无法及时变现资产偿还债务）和资产负债表破产（负债超过资产）。这一概念最早源于古罗马法，后在现代商业法律中得以系统化。  
  **English Explanation**: Insolvency refers to the financial state in which an individual or entity is unable to meet its debt obligations when they are due. It is generally categorized into two types: cash-flow insolvency (inability to liquidate assets to pay debts) and balance-sheet insolvency (liabilities exceed assets). The concept originated in Roman law and was later systematized in modern commercial law.
