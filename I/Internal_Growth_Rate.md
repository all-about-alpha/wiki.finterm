# Internal Growth Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **内部增长率**（Internal Growth Rate, IGR）是指企业在不依赖外部融资（如发行新股或借款）的情况下，仅通过内部资源（如留存收益和资产再投资）实现的最大可持续增长率。这一概念由财务学家提出，核心在于衡量企业自我造血能力和财务健康度。  
  The **Internal Growth Rate (IGR)** refers to the maximum sustainable growth rate a company can achieve without relying on external financing (such as issuing new shares or borrowing), solely through internal resources (such as retained earnings and asset reinvestment). This concept was introduced by financial scholars, focusing on measuring a company's self-sustaining ability and financial health.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文语境中，内部增长率常用于评估企业的内生增长潜力，特别是在初创企业或成熟企业的战略规划中。它帮助管理层判断是否需要外部融资或优化内部资源配置。需要注意的是，过高的内部增长率可能导致企业过度依赖留存收益，影响股东分红。  
  In English contexts, the Internal Growth Rate is often used to evaluate a company's potential for organic growth, particularly in strategic planning for startups or mature enterprises. It helps management determine whether external financing is needed or if internal resource allocation should be optimized. It’s important to note that an excessively high IGR may lead to over-reliance on retained earnings, potentially affecting shareholder dividends.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，内部增长率是衡量企业财务稳健性和长期发展能力的重要指标。对于投资者而言，高内部增长率通常意味着企业具备较强的盈利能力和资本效率；对于监管机构而言，它是评估企业风险的重要参考；对于行业而言，它反映了企业的竞争力和市场地位。  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Internal Growth Rate is a crucial metric for assessing a company's financial stability and long-term development potential. For investors, a high IGR often indicates strong profitability and capital efficiency; for regulators, it serves as an important reference for evaluating corporate risk; for industries, it reflects a company's competitiveness and market position.
