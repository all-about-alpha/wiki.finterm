# Income Annuity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：收入年金（Income Annuity）是一种金融产品，通常由保险公司提供，投保人一次性或分期支付保费后，保险公司承诺在未来某一时间开始，按照约定的周期（如每月或每年）向投保人支付固定金额的收入，直至投保人身故或合同期满。其核心概念是为投保人提供长期、稳定的收入来源，常用于退休规划。  
  - **English Explanation**: An income annuity is a financial product typically offered by insurance companies. The policyholder pays a lump sum or periodic premiums, and in return, the insurer promises to provide fixed payments at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or annually) starting at a future date, continuing until the policyholder's death or the end of the contract term. Its core concept is to provide a long-term, stable income stream, often used for retirement planning.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景与风险提示**：收入年金常用于退休规划，帮助个人在退休后获得稳定的收入来源。其应用场景包括补充养老金、规避长寿风险（即退休后收入不足的风险）。然而，投保人需注意流动性风险，因为一旦购买年金，资金通常无法提前支取。此外，通货膨胀可能削弱年金的实际购买力。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**: Income annuities are commonly used in retirement planning to provide a steady income stream post-retirement. Applications include supplementing pension income and mitigating longevity risk (the risk of outliving one's savings). However, policyholders should be aware of liquidity risks, as funds are typically inaccessible once the annuity is purchased. Additionally, inflation may erode the real value of annuity payments over time.

  - **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, income annuities are a critical component of the insurance industry, subject to strict oversight to protect policyholders. From an investment standpoint, they offer a low-risk tool for securing retirement income. From an industry perspective, annuity products drive diversification in the insurance market and help insurers manage long-term liabilities.
