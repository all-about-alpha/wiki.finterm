    反向ETF（Inverse ETF）是一种交易所交易基金，旨在通过使用衍生工具（如期货、期权和互换合约）提供与标的指数或资产相反的日回报。例如，如果某指数下跌1%，反向ETF可能上涨1%。它通常用于对冲市场下跌风险或进行短期投机。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    An Inverse ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a type of ETF designed to provide the opposite daily return of a target index or asset by using derivatives such as futures, options, and swap contracts. For example, if an index drops by 1%, the inverse ETF may rise by 1%. It is commonly used for hedging against market declines or short-term speculation.

* **应用 / Application**

    反向ETF主要用于对冲市场下跌风险或进行短期投机。例如，投资者在市场预期下跌时购买反向ETF以获利。然而，由于其高波动性和复利效应，长期持有可能导致显著损失。因此，它更适合经验丰富的投资者进行短期操作。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    Inverse ETFs are primarily used for hedging against market declines or short-term speculation. For instance, investors may buy inverse ETFs when anticipating a market downturn to profit. However, due to their high volatility and compounding effects, long-term holding can lead to significant losses. Thus, they are more suitable for experienced investors engaging in short-term trading.
