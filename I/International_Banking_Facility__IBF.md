    An International Banking Facility (IBF) is a specialized financial instrument within the U.S. banking system that allows U.S.-based banks to offer offshore banking services to foreign clients through a separate accounting system. IBFs are exempt from many domestic banking regulations but are restricted to transactions with non-U.S. residents or entities. Established by the Federal Reserve in 1981, the IBF was designed to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. banks in the global financial market.
