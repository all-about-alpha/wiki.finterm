# Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：故意缺陷授予人信托（IDGT）是一种特殊的信托结构，其“缺陷”在于授予人（Grantor）在税务上仍被视为信托资产的所有者，尽管法律上资产已转移至信托。这种设计允许授予人继续为信托的所得税负责，同时实现资产转移和遗产税减免的目的。  
  **English Explanation**: An Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT) is a specialized trust structure where the "defect" lies in the grantor being treated as the owner of the trust assets for income tax purposes, even though the assets have been legally transferred to the trust. This design allows the grantor to remain responsible for the trust's income taxes while achieving asset transfer and estate tax reduction goals.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：IDGT常用于高净值人士的财富传承规划中，特别是在需要减少遗产税负担的情况下。通过将资产转移至IDGT，授予人可以在生前减少应税遗产规模，同时保留对信托资产的某些控制权。需要注意的是，这种结构可能涉及复杂的税务和法律问题，需谨慎操作。  
  **English Explanation**: IDGTs are commonly used in estate planning for high-net-worth individuals, particularly when there is a need to reduce estate tax burdens. By transferring assets to an IDGT, the grantor can reduce the size of their taxable estate during their lifetime while retaining certain control over the trust assets. It is important to note that this structure may involve complex tax and legal issues and should be approached with caution.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从税务和财富管理角度来看，IDGT提供了一种有效的工具来优化遗产规划和税务策略。它允许授予人在不增加所得税负担的情况下转移资产，同时为受益人提供长期的财务保障。在监管层面，IDGT的使用也推动了信托法和税法的进一步完善。  
  **English Explanation**: From a tax and wealth management perspective, IDGTs provide an effective tool for optimizing estate planning and tax strategies. They allow grantors to transfer assets without increasing income tax liabilities while providing long-term financial security for beneficiaries. On a regulatory level, the use of IDGTs has also driven further refinement of trust and tax laws.
