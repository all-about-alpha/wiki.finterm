# Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：激励性股票期权（Incentive Stock Options, ISOs）是一种由公司授予员工的股票期权，旨在激励员工长期为公司服务并提升公司价值。ISOs通常享有税收优惠，员工在行权时无需缴纳普通所得税，只有在出售股票时才需缴纳资本利得税。  
  **English Explanation**: Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) are a type of stock option granted by a company to its employees, designed to incentivize long-term service and enhance company value. ISOs typically offer tax advantages, as employees are not subject to ordinary income tax upon exercise but only pay capital gains tax when the shares are sold.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景与风险提示**：ISOs常用于初创公司或高科技企业，作为吸引和保留关键人才的手段。员工需注意行权价格、持有期限（通常为一年以上）以及市场波动带来的风险。此外，ISOs的税收优惠条件较为严格，未满足条件可能导致税收优惠失效。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: ISOs are commonly used in startups or high-tech companies as a means to attract and retain key talent. Employees should be aware of the exercise price, holding period (typically over one year), and risks associated with market fluctuations. Additionally, the tax benefits of ISOs come with strict conditions, and failure to meet these may result in the loss of tax advantages.
