## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    国际标准化组织（ISO）是一个独立的非政府国际组织，成立于1947年，总部位于瑞士日内瓦。ISO的主要职责是制定和发布国际标准，以促进全球贸易、技术交流和产品质量提升。其标准涵盖各个行业，包括技术、安全、环境、医疗等领域。ISO标准旨在确保产品、服务和系统的质量、安全性和效率，从而促进全球市场的互操作性和一致性。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization established in 1947, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO's primary mission is to develop and publish international standards to facilitate global trade, technological exchange, and product quality improvement. Its standards cover various industries, including technology, safety, environment, and healthcare. ISO standards aim to ensure the quality, safety, and efficiency of products, services, and systems, thereby promoting interoperability and consistency in global markets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    ISO标准广泛应用于制造业、服务业、信息技术、医疗设备等领域。例如，ISO 9001是质量管理体系的国际标准，帮助企业提高运营效率和客户满意度；ISO 14001是环境管理体系的国际标准，帮助企业减少环境影响。在中国，许多企业通过ISO认证来提升国际竞争力，尤其是在出口贸易中，ISO认证常被视为产品质量的保证。需要注意的是，ISO认证并非强制性，但未获得认证的企业可能在国际市场中处于劣势。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    ISO standards are widely applied in industries such as manufacturing, services, information technology, and medical devices. For example, ISO 9001 is an international standard for quality management systems, helping businesses improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction; ISO 14001 is an international standard for environmental management systems, assisting companies in reducing their environmental impact. In China, many enterprises obtain ISO certification to enhance their international competitiveness, especially in export trade, where ISO certification is often seen as a guarantee of product quality. It is important to note that ISO certification is not mandatory, but companies without certification may be at a disadvantage in the global market.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，ISO标准为各国政府提供了制定法规的参考依据；从投资角度看，ISO认证是企业合规性和管理水平的体现，有助于吸引投资者；从行业角度看，ISO标准推动了技术创新和产业升级，促进了全球供应链的整合。在中国，ISO标准的推广与“中国制造2025”战略高度契合，助力中国企业走向国际化。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, ISO standards provide governments with a reference for formulating regulations; from an investment perspective, ISO certification reflects a company's compliance and management level, helping to attract investors; from an industry perspective, ISO standards drive technological innovation and industrial upgrading, promoting the integration of global supply chains. In China, the promotion of ISO standards aligns closely with the "Made in China 2025" strategy, supporting Chinese enterprises in their internationalization efforts.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    ISO的起源可以追溯到20世纪初，当时工业革命推动了全球贸易和技术交流，但缺乏统一的标准导致了许多问题。1946年，来自25个国家的代表在伦敦召开会议，决定成立一个国际标准化组织。1947年2月23日，ISO正式成立，其名称“ISO”源自希腊语“isos”，意为“平等”，体现了标准化的核心理念。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The origin of ISO dates back to the early 20th century when the Industrial Revolution spurred global trade and technological exchange, but the lack of unified standards caused numerous issues. In 1946, representatives from 25 countries met in London and decided to establish an international standardization organization. On February 23, 1947, ISO was officially founded. The name "ISO" is derived from the Greek word "isos," meaning "equal," reflecting the core concept of standardization.

* **影响 / Impact**
