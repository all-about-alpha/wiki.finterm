# Impaired Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：受损信用（Impaired Credit）是指借款人或发行人的信用状况显著恶化，导致其偿还债务的能力受到质疑。通常表现为信用评级下调、违约风险增加或财务状况恶化。这一概念在金融风险管理中尤为重要，常用于评估贷款、债券等金融工具的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Impaired Credit refers to a significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of a borrower or issuer, raising doubts about their ability to repay debts. It is often characterized by credit rating downgrades, increased default risk, or deteriorating financial conditions. This concept is crucial in financial risk management and is commonly used to assess the risk of loans, bonds, and other financial instruments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：受损信用广泛应用于银行、保险公司和投资机构的风险评估中。例如，银行在发放贷款前会评估借款人的信用状况，若发现其信用受损，可能会提高利率或拒绝贷款。此外，债券投资者也会关注发行人的信用状况，以避免投资于高风险债券。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Impaired Credit is widely used in risk assessment by banks, insurance companies, and investment institutions. For instance, banks evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness before issuing loans; if impaired credit is detected, they may increase interest rates or deny the loan. Similarly, bond investors monitor issuers' credit conditions to avoid high-risk investments.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，受损信用的识别有助于防范系统性金融风险；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者规避潜在损失；从行业角度看，它推动了更严格的信用评估标准和风险管理工具的发展。

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：受损信用的概念起源于20世纪初的金融市场发展过程中。随着信贷市场的扩大和复杂化，金融机构开始意识到借款人违约风险的增加。1929年的大萧条进一步凸显了信用风险管理的重要性，促使学术界和业界深入研究这一领域。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of impaired credit emerged during the development of financial markets in the early 20th century. As credit markets expanded and became more complex, financial institutions began to recognize the increasing risk of borrower defaults. The Great Depression of 1929 further highlighted the importance of credit risk management, prompting academic and industry research into this area.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：受损信用的识别和管理对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。2008年金融危机期间，大量次级贷款违约暴露了信用评估的不足，促使各国加强监管并改进风险评估模型。如今，受损信用的管理已成为金融机构日常运营的核心环节之一。
