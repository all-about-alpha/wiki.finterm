## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：损益表的雏形可追溯至14世纪的意大利复式记账法。随着工业革命的兴起和企业规模的扩大，19世纪末至20世纪初，现代意义上的损益表逐渐形成并成为财务报表的核心组成部分。1929年经济大萧条后，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的成立进一步推动了损益表的标准化和规范化。  
  **English Origin**: The prototype of the income statement can be traced back to double-entry bookkeeping in 14th-century Italy. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of businesses, the modern income statement gradually took shape in the late 19th to early 20th century and became a core component of financial statements. After the Great Depression of 1929, the establishment of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further promoted its standardization.
