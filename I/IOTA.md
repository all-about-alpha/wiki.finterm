# IOTA

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  IOTA 是一种基于分布式账本技术的加密货币，专为物联网（IoT）设计。它由 David Sønstebø、Sergey Ivancheglo、Dominik Schiener 和 Serguei Popov 于 2015 年创立，采用了一种称为“Tangle”的新型数据结构，取代了传统的区块链技术。IOTA 的核心概念包括无手续费交易、高扩展性和数据完整性。  
  IOTA is a cryptocurrency based on distributed ledger technology, specifically designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). It was founded in 2015 by David Sønstebø, Sergey Ivancheglo, Dominik Schiener, and Serguei Popov. IOTA uses a novel data structure called "Tangle," which replaces traditional blockchain technology. Its core concepts include feeless transactions, high scalability, and data integrity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  IOTA 主要应用于物联网设备之间的微支付和数据传输。例如，智能城市中的传感器可以通过 IOTA 实现自动支付和数据交换。此外，IOTA 还被用于供应链管理、能源交易和数字身份验证等领域。需要注意的是，IOTA 技术仍处于发展阶段，可能存在网络安全和稳定性风险。  
  IOTA is primarily used for micropayments and data transfer between IoT devices. For example, sensors in smart cities can use IOTA for automated payments and data exchange. Additionally, IOTA is applied in supply chain management, energy trading, and digital identity verification. It is important to note that IOTA technology is still in development and may face risks related to cybersecurity and stability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，IOTA 的无手续费和高效特性使其在物联网领域具有独特优势，但也可能引发新的监管挑战。从投资角度看，IOTA 的创新技术吸引了大量关注，但其市场表现波动较大。从行业角度看，IOTA 为物联网设备的经济交互提供了新的可能性，推动了去中心化技术的发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, IOTA's feeless and efficient features give it a unique advantage in the IoT space, but they may also pose new regulatory challenges. From an investment perspective, IOTA's innovative technology has attracted significant attention, but its market performance is highly volatile. From an industry perspective, IOTA enables new possibilities for economic interactions among IoT devices and promotes the development of decentralized technologies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  IOTA 的构想始于 2015 年，创始团队旨在解决区块链技术在物联网应用中的局限性。2016 年，IOTA 基金会成立，负责项目的开发和推广。Tangle 技术的提出标志着 IOTA 与传统区块链的分道扬镳，其灵感来源于有向无环图（DAG）数据结构。  
  The concept of IOTA began in 2015, with the founding team aiming to address the limitations of blockchain technology in IoT applications. In 2016, the IOTA Foundation was established to oversee the project's development and promotion. The introduction of Tangle technology marked IOTA's departure from traditional blockchain, inspired by the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  IOTA 的出现对物联网行业产生了深远影响，推动了设备间经济交互的自动化。目前，IOTA 已与多家企业和政府机构合作，探索其在智能城市、能源管理和供应链等领域的应用。然而，其技术复杂性和潜在的安全漏洞也引发了行业的广泛讨论。  
  The emergence of IOTA has had a profound impact on the IoT industry, promoting the automation of economic interactions between devices. Currently, IOTA has partnered with numerous enterprises and government agencies to explore its applications in smart cities, energy management, and supply chains. However, its technical complexity and potential security vulnerabilities have sparked widespread discussion in the industry.
