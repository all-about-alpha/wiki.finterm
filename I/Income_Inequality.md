# Income Inequality

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  收入不平等（Income Inequality）是指在一个社会或经济体中，个人或家庭之间的收入分配存在显著差异的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家如皮凯蒂（Thomas Piketty）等人在研究财富分配时提出，核心在于衡量收入分布的集中程度。  
  Income inequality refers to the significant disparity in income distribution among individuals or households within a society or economy. This concept was initially introduced by economists such as Thomas Piketty in their studies on wealth distribution, focusing on measuring the concentration of income.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，收入不平等现象在城乡差距、行业薪酬差异以及区域经济发展不均衡中尤为明显。例如，东部沿海地区与西部内陆地区的收入差距较大，金融行业与制造业的薪酬水平也存在显著差异。需要注意的是，过度的收入不平等可能引发社会不稳定和消费能力下降等风险。  
  In China, income inequality is particularly evident in the urban-rural divide, industry wage gaps, and regional economic disparities. For instance, the income gap between coastal areas in the east and inland regions in the west is significant, and there are notable differences in wages between the financial sector and manufacturing. It is important to note that excessive income inequality may lead to social instability and reduced consumer spending.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，中国政府通过税收政策和社会保障体系来缓解收入不平等；从投资角度看，收入不平等影响消费结构和市场需求；从行业角度看，高收入行业与低收入行业的差距可能加剧人才流失和资源分配不均。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Chinese government addresses income inequality through tax policies and social security systems; from an investment perspective, it affects consumption patterns and market demand; from an industry perspective, the gap between high-income and low-income sectors may exacerbate talent drain and resource misallocation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  收入不平等的概念可以追溯到19世纪工业革命时期，当时资本家和工人之间的财富差距迅速扩大。20世纪初，经济学家如维尔弗雷多·帕累托（Vilfredo Pareto）提出了“帕累托法则”，进一步揭示了财富分配的不平等现象。21世纪以来，皮凯蒂的《21世纪资本论》重新将这一问题带入公众视野。  
  The concept of income inequality dates back to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century when wealth disparities between capitalists and workers rapidly widened. In the early 20th century, economists like Vilfredo Pareto introduced the "Pareto Principle," further revealing inequalities in wealth distribution. Since the 21st century, Thomas Piketty's *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* has brought this issue back into public focus.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，改革开放后经济快速增长的同时也加剧了收入不平等问题。近年来，政府通过精准扶贫和区域协调发展战略逐步缩小差距。在全球范围内，收入不平等已成为各国政府和经济组织关注的核心议题之一。  
  In China, rapid economic growth following reform and opening-up has exacerbated income inequality. In recent years, the government has gradually narrowed this gap through targeted poverty alleviation and regional coordinated development strategies. Globally, income inequality has become a central issue for governments and economic organizations.
