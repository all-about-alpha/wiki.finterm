# Implied Contract

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：默示合同（Implied Contract）是指合同双方并未通过明确的书面或口头协议达成一致，而是通过双方的行为、交易习惯或法律推定形成的具有法律约束力的协议。其核心概念在于合同的成立并非基于明确的表达，而是基于双方的默示行为或特定情境下的合理推断。  
  **English Explanation**: An implied contract is a legally binding agreement formed not through explicit written or verbal communication, but through the actions, conduct, or circumstances of the parties involved. Its core concept lies in the fact that the contract is established based on implied behavior or reasonable inference in specific situations rather than explicit expression.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：默示合同常见于日常交易、雇佣关系和服务提供等场景。例如，顾客在餐厅点餐后未明确签订合同，但餐厅提供服务的行为和顾客支付费用的行为构成默示合同。需要注意的是，默示合同的认定依赖于具体情境和法律规定，可能存在争议风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Implied contracts are commonly seen in daily transactions, employment relationships, and service provisions. For example, when a customer orders food at a restaurant without signing an explicit contract, the act of the restaurant providing service and the customer paying constitutes an implied contract. It is important to note that the recognition of an implied contract depends on specific circumstances and legal regulations, which may lead to disputes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从法律和行业角度来看，默示合同填补了明确合同缺失时的空白，保障了交易双方的权益。在投资和商业活动中，理解默示合同有助于避免法律纠纷并维护商业信誉。监管机构也通过相关法律确保默示合同的公平性和可执行性。  
  **English Explanation**: From legal and industry perspectives, implied contracts fill gaps where explicit contracts are absent, protecting the rights of both parties in a transaction. In investment and business activities, understanding implied contracts helps avoid legal disputes and maintain commercial credibility. Regulatory bodies also ensure the fairness and enforceability of implied contracts through relevant laws.
