## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：铁鹰策略（Iron Condor）是一种期权交易策略，由同时卖出两个不同行权价的看涨期权和看跌期权，并买入两个更远离当前价格的行权价的看涨期权和看跌期权组成。该策略旨在通过收取期权权利金获利，同时限制潜在亏损。其核心概念是利用市场波动性较低的环境，通过构建一个价格区间（即“鹰翼”）来获取收益。  
  **English Explanation**: The Iron Condor is an options trading strategy that involves simultaneously selling a call option and a put option at different strike prices, while also buying a call option and a put option at strike prices further away from the current price.

Its core concept is to capitalize on low market volatility by establishing a price range (the "wings") to generate income.
