# Interest Rate Floor

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：利率下限（Interest Rate Floor）是一种金融衍生工具，通常用于保护借款人免受利率下降的影响。它设定了一个最低利率水平，当市场利率低于这个水平时，借款人仍按设定的下限利率支付利息。利率下限通常与浮动利率贷款或债券结合使用，以确保借款人的利息支出不会低于某一预定水平。  
  **English Explanation**: An interest rate floor is a financial derivative instrument designed to protect borrowers from the impact of declining interest rates. It sets a minimum interest rate level, ensuring that if market rates fall below this level, the borrower still pays interest at the predetermined floor rate. Interest rate floors are often used in conjunction with floating-rate loans or bonds to guarantee that the borrower's interest payments do not fall below a specified threshold.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：利率下限常用于企业或金融机构的浮动利率贷款中，特别是在利率波动较大的市场环境下。例如，银行可能为贷款设定一个利率下限，以确保即使在市场利率大幅下降时，仍能获得最低的利息收入。对于借款人而言，利率下限可以锁定最低利息成本，但同时也可能增加融资成本。  
  **English Application**: Interest rate floors are commonly used in floating-rate loans for corporations or financial institutions, especially in volatile interest rate environments. For example, a bank might set an interest rate floor on a loan to ensure a minimum interest income even if market rates drop significantly. For borrowers, an interest rate floor can lock in a minimum interest cost but may also increase financing expenses.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，利率下限有助于稳定金融市场，防止利率过度波动带来的风险。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了一种风险管理工具，尤其是在利率下行周期中。从行业角度看，利率下限的使用有助于金融机构更好地管理资产负债表的利率风险。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, interest rate floors help stabilize financial markets by mitigating risks associated with excessive interest rate volatility. From an investment standpoint, they provide a risk management tool, particularly during periods of declining interest rates. From an industry perspective, the use of interest rate floors enables financial institutions to better manage interest rate risks on their balance sheets.
