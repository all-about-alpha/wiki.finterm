# Irrevocable Beneficiary

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **不可撤销受益人**是指在保险或信托等金融安排中，被指定为受益人且其受益权不能被保单持有人或信托设立人单方面更改或撤销的个人或实体。这一安排确保了受益人的权益不受后续变更的影响。  
  An **irrevocable beneficiary** is an individual or entity designated in financial arrangements such as insurance or trusts whose beneficiary rights cannot be unilaterally altered or revoked by the policyholder or trust settlor. This ensures the beneficiary's rights are protected from subsequent changes.

* **应用 / Application**  
  不可撤销受益人常见于人寿保险、信托基金等场景，通常用于保障特定人群（如配偶、子女）的长期利益。需要注意的是，一旦设定为不可撤销受益人，保单持有人或信托设立人无法在不经受益人同意的情况下更改受益权，这可能导致灵活性受限。  
  Irrevocable beneficiaries are commonly used in life insurance and trust funds to secure the long-term interests of specific individuals (e.g., spouses, children). It is important to note that once designated as an irrevocable beneficiary, the policyholder or trust settlor cannot alter the beneficiary rights without the beneficiary's consent, which may limit flexibility.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和行业角度来看，不可撤销受益人的设定有助于保护弱势群体的权益，防止保单持有人或信托设立人滥用权力。在投资领域，这种安排也增强了合同的稳定性和可预测性。  
  From regulatory and industry perspectives, the designation of irrevocable beneficiaries helps protect the rights of vulnerable groups and prevents abuse of power by policyholders or trust settlors. In investment contexts, this arrangement enhances contract stability and predictability.
