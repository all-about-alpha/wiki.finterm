# Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：增量资本产出率（ICOR）是衡量一个国家或地区经济效率的指标，表示每增加一单位产出所需的资本投入量。它由经济学家在20世纪中期提出，核心概念是通过资本投入与产出增长的关系来评估经济增长的效率。  
  **English Explanation**: The Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) is a metric used to measure the economic efficiency of a country or region, indicating the amount of capital investment required to generate an additional unit of output. It was introduced by economists in the mid-20th century, with the core concept being to assess the efficiency of economic growth through the relationship between capital input and output growth.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：ICOR常用于宏观经济分析中，帮助政府和企业评估投资效率。例如，在制定经济发展规划时，较低的ICOR表明资本利用效率高，而较高的ICOR则可能意味着资源浪费或经济结构问题。需要注意的是，ICOR受技术水平和产业结构影响较大，需结合其他指标综合判断。  
  **English Application**: ICOR is commonly used in macroeconomic analysis to help governments and businesses evaluate investment efficiency. For instance, when formulating economic development plans, a lower ICOR indicates high capital utilization efficiency, while a higher ICOR may suggest resource waste or structural issues in the economy. It is important to note that ICOR is significantly influenced by technological levels and industrial structure, requiring comprehensive judgment alongside other indicators.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，ICOR是评估经济增长质量的重要工具；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者识别高效的投资领域；从行业角度看，低ICOR的行业通常更具竞争力。因此，优化ICOR是提升经济整体效率的关键。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, ICOR is a crucial tool for assessing the quality of economic growth; from an investment perspective, it helps investors identify high-efficiency sectors; from an industry perspective, sectors with low ICOR are generally more competitive. Therefore, optimizing ICOR is key to enhancing overall economic efficiency.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：ICOR的概念最早由经济学家在20世纪50年代提出，主要用于分析战后各国经济重建的效率。随着发展经济学兴起，这一指标被广泛应用于发展中国家经济增长的研究中。其发现过程与对资本积累和产出关系的探索密切相关。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of ICOR was first introduced by economists in the 1950s, primarily used to analyze the efficiency of post-war economic reconstruction in various countries. With the rise of development economics, this metric became widely applied in studies on economic growth in developing countries. Its discovery process is closely tied to exploring the relationship between capital accumulation and output.

* **影响 / Impact**
