# Revocable Trust

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 可撤销信托（Revocable Trust）是一种由委托人（Grantor）设立的信托，允许委托人在其有生之年随时修改或撤销信托条款。这种信托的核心概念在于其灵活性和控制权，委托人可以保留对信托资产的管理权和受益权，同时指定受益人。  
  **English Explanation**: A revocable trust is a type of trust established by a grantor that allows the grantor to modify or revoke the trust terms at any time during their lifetime. The core concept of this trust lies in its flexibility and control, as the grantor retains management and beneficiary rights over the trust assets while designating beneficiaries.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 可撤销信托常用于遗产规划，帮助委托人避免遗嘱认证程序，确保资产在委托人去世后顺利转移给受益人。此外，它还可用于管理委托人在丧失行为能力时的资产。需要注意的是，由于委托人对信托资产的控制权，这些资产仍可能被视为委托人的个人财产，从而影响税务和债务责任。  
  **English Explanation**: Revocable trusts are commonly used in estate planning to help grantors avoid probate proceedings and ensure smooth asset transfer to beneficiaries after the grantor's death. Additionally, they can be used to manage assets if the grantor becomes incapacitated. It is important to note that because the grantor retains control over the trust assets, these assets may still be considered personal property, affecting tax and liability implications.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，可撤销信托为委托人提供了法律上的灵活性；从投资角度看，它有助于优化资产配置和税务规划；从行业角度看，它是财富管理和遗产规划的重要工具。然而，由于其可撤销性，它可能无法提供与不可撤销信托相同的资产保护功能。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, revocable trusts offer legal flexibility to grantors; from an investment standpoint, they aid in optimizing asset allocation and tax planning; from an industry perspective, they are a crucial tool in wealth management and estate planning. However, due to their revocability, they may not provide the same level of asset protection as irrevocable trusts.
