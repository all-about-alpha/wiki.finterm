# Reinvestment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：再投资（Reinvestment）是指将投资收益（如利息、股息或资本利得）重新投入市场或原有资产中，以期望获得更多的收益。这一概念最早由经济学家提出，强调通过复利效应实现财富增长。核心在于利用已有收益进行二次投资，而非将其作为消费支出。  
  **English Explanation**: Reinvestment refers to the process of reinvesting investment returns (such as interest, dividends, or capital gains) back into the market or the original asset, with the aim of generating additional returns. This concept, originally proposed by economists, emphasizes wealth accumulation through the power of compounding. The core idea is to use existing returns for secondary investment rather than spending them.

  **English Application**: Reinvestment is widely used in financial products such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. For example, investors can choose to reinvest stock dividends to purchase more shares or use bond interest to buy additional bonds. It is important to note that while reinvestment can generate compounding returns, it also carries market volatility risks. Investors should make decisions based on their risk tolerance.
