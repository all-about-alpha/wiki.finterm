# Risk-Return Tradeoff

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：风险-收益权衡（Risk-Return Tradeoff）是金融学中的一个核心概念，由现代投资组合理论的奠基人哈里·马科维茨（Harry Markowitz）在20世纪50年代提出。它指的是投资者在追求更高收益时，必须承担更高的风险；反之，若选择低风险投资，则预期收益也会相应降低。这一概念强调了风险与收益之间的正相关关系。  
  **English Explanation**: The Risk-Return Tradeoff is a fundamental concept in finance, introduced by Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory, in the 1950s. It refers to the principle that higher potential returns on investment come with higher levels of risk, while lower-risk investments typically yield lower returns. This concept highlights the positive correlation between risk and return.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：在实际投资中，风险-收益权衡广泛应用于资产配置、投资组合管理和个人理财决策。例如，股票通常被视为高风险高回报的资产，而债券则被认为是低风险低回报的投资工具。投资者需根据自身的风险承受能力和投资目标来平衡风险和收益。需要注意的是，过度追求高收益可能导致不可控的风险暴露。  
  **English Explanation**: In practice, the Risk-Return Tradeoff is widely applied in asset allocation, portfolio management, and personal financial planning. For instance, stocks are generally considered high-risk, high-return assets, while bonds are viewed as low-risk, low-return investments. Investors must balance risk and return based on their risk tolerance and financial goals. It is crucial to note that excessive pursuit of high returns may lead to uncontrollable risk exposure.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，风险-收益权衡是金融决策的基础。它帮助投资者理性评估不同资产的风险和回报潜力，从而做出更科学的投资选择。同时，这一概念也推动了金融产品的创新和风险管理工具的发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Risk-Return Tradeoff is foundational to financial decision-making. It enables investors to rationally assess the risks and return potentials of different assets, leading to more informed investment choices. Additionally, this concept has driven innovation in financial products and the development of risk management tools.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：风险-收益权衡的概念起源于20世纪50年代哈里·马科维茨的现代投资组合理论（Modern Portfolio Theory）。马科维茨通过数学建模证明了分散投资可以降低非系统性风险，并首次系统性地阐述了风险与回报之间的关系。这一理论为后来的资本资产定价模型（CAPM）和有效市场假说（EMH）奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the Risk-Return Tradeoff originated in the 1950s with Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Markowitz used mathematical modeling to demonstrate that diversification reduces unsystematic risk and systematically articulated the relationship between risk and return for the first time. This theory laid the groundwork for later developments such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：马科维茨的理论对全球金融行业产生了深远影响，推动了资产管理、风险评估和金融工程等领域的快速发展。如今，风险-收益权衡已成为投资者教育的重要内容，并在全球范围内广泛应用于个人和机构投资者的决策过程中。  
  **English Explanation**: Markowitz's theory has had a profound impact on the global financial industry, driving rapid advancements in asset management, risk assessment, and financial engineering. Today, the Risk-Return Tradeoff is a key component of investor education and is widely applied in decision-making processes for both individual and institutional investors worldwide.
