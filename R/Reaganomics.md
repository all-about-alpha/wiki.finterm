## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：里根经济学（Reaganomics）是指美国前总统罗纳德·里根在1980年代推行的一系列经济政策，核心内容包括减税、减少政府开支、放松管制和紧缩货币供应。其理论基础源自供给学派经济学，强调通过刺激生产和投资来促进经济增长。  
  **English Explanation**: Reaganomics refers to the economic policies implemented by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s, centered on tax cuts, reduced government spending, deregulation, and tight monetary supply. Its theoretical foundation lies in supply-side economics, emphasizing economic growth through stimulating production and investment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：里根经济学主要应用于美国经济复苏时期，旨在解决滞涨问题（高通胀与高失业率并存）。其政策通过减税鼓励企业投资和个人消费，同时减少政府干预以提升市场效率。然而，这些政策也导致财政赤字扩大和收入不平等加剧。  
  **English Explanation**: Reaganomics was primarily applied during the U.S. economic recovery period to address stagflation (high inflation coupled with high unemployment). Its policies encouraged business investment and personal consumption through tax cuts while reducing government intervention to enhance market efficiency. However, these policies also led to increased fiscal deficits and income inequality.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，里根经济学推动了市场自由化；从投资角度看，减税政策刺激了资本流动；从行业角度看，放松管制促进了创新和竞争。然而，其长期影响仍存在争议，尤其是在财政可持续性和社会公平方面。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Reaganomics promoted market liberalization; from an investment perspective, tax cuts stimulated capital flows; from an industry perspective, deregulation fostered innovation and competition. However, its long-term impact remains debated, particularly regarding fiscal sustainability and social equity.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：里根经济学的起源可追溯到1970年代末的美国滞涨危机。罗纳德·里根在1981年就任总统后，采纳了供给学派经济学家如阿瑟·拉弗的建议，推出了以减税为核心的经济改革计划。这一政策标志着美国经济从凯恩斯主义向供给学派的转变。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of Reaganomics can be traced back to the stagflation crisis in the late 1970s in the United States. After assuming office in 1981, Ronald Reagan adopted recommendations from supply-side economists like Arthur Laffer and launched an economic reform plan centered on tax cuts. This policy marked a shift from Keynesian economics to supply-side economics in the U.S.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：里根经济学对美国经济产生了深远影响，短期内推动了经济增长和就业率上升，但也导致财政赤字大幅增加和贫富差距扩大。其放松管制的理念对全球金融市场产生了广泛影响，成为许多国家经济改革的参考模板。  
  **English Explanation**: Reaganomics had a profound impact on the U.S. economy, driving short-term economic growth and employment but also leading to significant fiscal deficits and widening wealth gaps. Its deregulation philosophy influenced global financial markets widely and became a reference model for economic reforms in many countries.
