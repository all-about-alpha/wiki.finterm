# Reinvestment Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **再投资率** 是指投资者将投资收益（如利息、股息或资本利得）重新投入到相同或不同的投资工具中的比例。这一概念由现代金融理论发展而来，核心在于通过复利效应实现财富的持续增长。  
  The **Reinvestment Rate** refers to the proportion of investment returns (such as interest, dividends, or capital gains) that an investor reinvests into the same or different investment vehicles. This concept originates from modern financial theory and emphasizes the power of compounding to achieve sustained wealth growth.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文语境中，再投资率常用于评估企业或个人在获得收益后的资金管理策略。例如，企业可能将利润再投资于研发或扩张，而个人投资者则可能将股息再投入股市以增加长期回报。需要注意的是，高再投资率并不总是有利的，需结合市场环境和风险承受能力进行权衡。  
  In English contexts, the reinvestment rate is often used to evaluate the capital management strategies of businesses or individuals after earning returns. For instance, a company might reinvest profits into R&D or expansion, while individual investors may reinvest dividends into stocks to enhance long-term returns. It’s important to note that a high reinvestment rate isn’t always beneficial and must be balanced with market conditions and risk tolerance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，再投资率是衡量经济活力和企业成长潜力的重要指标。高再投资率通常被视为积极信号，表明企业或个人对未来充满信心并致力于长期发展。然而，过高的再投资率也可能导致现金流紧张或过度扩张的风险。  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the reinvestment rate is a key indicator of economic vitality and growth potential. A high reinvestment rate is often seen as a positive sign, reflecting confidence in the future and commitment to long-term development. However, excessively high rates may lead to cash flow strain or overexpansion risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context
