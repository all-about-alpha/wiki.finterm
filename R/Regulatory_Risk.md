  **English Explanation**: Regulatory Risk refers to the uncertainty or potential loss faced by businesses or investors due to changes in laws, regulations, policies, or the regulatory environment.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：监管风险的概念最早可追溯至20世纪初，随着现代金融体系的建立和政府干预经济的加强，监管风险逐渐成为企业和投资者关注的焦点。例如，1929年大萧条后，美国出台《格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案》，严格分离商业银行和投资银行业务，这一政策变化对金融机构产生了深远影响。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Regulatory Risk can be traced back to the early 20th century, as the establishment of modern financial systems and increased government intervention in the economy made it a growing concern for businesses and investors. For example, after the Great Depression of 1929, the U.S. enacted the Glass-Steagall Act, which strictly separated commercial and investment banking, significantly impacting financial institutions.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：监管风险对全球各行业产生了深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机后，全球范围内加强了对金融行业的监管，如《多德-弗兰克法案》的出台。这些法规不仅改变了金融机构的运营模式，也影响了全球资本流动和市场稳定性。当前，随着数字化转型和气候变化问题的加剧，监管风险在科技和环保领域的重要性日益凸显。  
  **English Explanation**: Regulatory Risk has had a profound impact on industries worldwide. For instance, after the 2008 financial crisis, global regulations on the financial sector were strengthened, such as the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.
