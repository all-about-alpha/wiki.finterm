# Rollover Risk

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：展期风险（Rollover Risk）是指借款人在债务到期时无法顺利续借或再融资，导致无法偿还债务的风险。这种风险通常出现在短期债务频繁展期的场景中，尤其是在市场流动性紧张或信用环境恶化时。  
  **English Explanation**: Rollover risk refers to the risk that a borrower is unable to renew or refinance their debt upon maturity, leading to potential default. This risk is particularly prevalent in scenarios where short-term debt is frequently rolled over, especially during periods of tight market liquidity or deteriorating credit conditions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：展期风险常见于企业依赖短期融资来支持长期项目的情况。例如，房地产开发商可能通过短期贷款来支持长期建设项目，若在贷款到期时无法续借，可能导致资金链断裂。此外，金融机构在管理流动性时也需警惕展期风险，尤其是在市场波动较大的时期。  
  **English Application**: Rollover risk is often seen in businesses that rely on short-term financing for long-term projects. For instance, real estate developers may use short-term loans to fund long-term construction projects. If they cannot roll over the debt upon maturity, it may lead to a liquidity crisis. Financial institutions also need to be vigilant about rollover risk when managing liquidity, especially during periods of high market volatility.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，展期风险是金融稳定性的重要考量因素之一。监管机构通常会要求金融机构进行压力测试，以评估其在极端市场条件下的展期能力。从投资角度看，投资者需关注企业的债务结构及其应对展期风险的能力，以评估其信用风险。从行业角度看，高展期风险可能导致系统性金融风险的积累。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, rollover risk is a critical factor in financial stability. Regulators often require financial institutions to conduct stress tests to assess their ability to roll over debt under extreme market conditions. From an investment standpoint, investors need to evaluate a company's debt structure and its ability to manage rollover risk as part of their credit risk assessment. From an industry perspective, high rollover risk can contribute to the accumulation of systemic financial risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：展期风险的概念最早可追溯至20世纪70年代的美国银行业危机。当时许多银行依赖短期存款来支持长期贷款业务，当市场利率上升时，存款流失导致银行无法续借资金，进而引发流动性危机。这一事件促使监管机构加强对金融机构流动性管理的监管。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of rollover risk can be traced back to the U.S. banking crisis in the 1970s. At that time, many banks relied on short-term deposits to fund long-term loans. When market interest rates rose, deposit outflows made it difficult for banks to roll over their funding, leading to liquidity crises. This event prompted regulators to strengthen oversight of financial institutions' liquidity management.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：展期风险的教训深刻影响了全球金融体系的改革。2008年金融危机期间，许多金融机构因无法续借短期债务而陷入困境，进一步凸显了管理展期风险的重要性。如今，各国监管机构已将展期风险管理纳入宏观审慎政策框架中。  
  **English Impact**: The lessons from rollover risk have profoundly influenced global financial system reforms. During the 2008 financial crisis, many financial institutions faced difficulties due to their inability to roll over short-term debt, further highlighting the importance of managing this risk. Today, regulators worldwide have incorporated rollover risk management into macroprudential policy frameworks.
