## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：重组的实践可以追溯到19世纪末的工业革命时期，当时企业为应对市场竞争和规模扩张需求开始进行结构调整。20世纪初的美国大萧条时期，破产法（如《美国破产法》第11章）的出台为现代企业重组提供了法律框架。中国在改革开放后逐步引入市场化重组机制，特别是在国有企业改革中广泛应用。  
  **English Origin**: The practice of reorganization dates back to the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century when companies began structural adjustments to cope with market competition and scale expansion. During the Great Depression in the early 20th century, bankruptcy laws (e.g., Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) provided a legal framework for modern corporate reorganization. China introduced market-oriented reorganization mechanisms after its reform and opening-up policy, particularly in state-owned enterprise reforms.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：重组对全球经济发展产生了深远影响。例如，美国通用汽车（GM）在2009年的破产重组使其成功转型并恢复盈利能力；中国的国有企业通过混合所有制改革实现了资源整合和效率提升。目前，随着全球经济环境的变化，跨国企业和新兴市场企业的重组活动日益频繁。  
  **English Impact**: Reorganization has had a profound impact on global economic development.
