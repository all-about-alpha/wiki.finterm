* **应用 / Application**

  In business operations, receivables are common financial items, especially in credit sales models. Companies expand sales through credit sales but also face risks of customer default or delayed payments. Therefore, businesses need to strengthen credit management, regularly assess customer creditworthiness, and take collection measures to reduce bad debt risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  应收账款的起源可以追溯到古代贸易活动。在早期的物物交换中，交易双方逐渐发展出信用交易模式，即先交货后付款的形式。随着商业的发展，特别是中世纪欧洲的贸易繁荣，“应收账款”作为一种财务概念逐渐形成并广泛应用于商业活动中。  
  The origin of receivables can be traced back to ancient trade activities. In early barter systems, trading parties gradually developed credit transactions—delivering goods first and paying later. With the growth of commerce, especially during the trade boom in medieval Europe, "receivables" as a financial concept gradually formed and became widely used in business activities.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  应收账款的出现极大地促进了商业信用的发展，推动了全球贸易的繁荣。在现代经济中，应收账款已成为企业财务管理的重要组成部分。随着金融工具的创新（如保理、资产证券化），应收账款的流动性得到进一步提升，为企业提供了更多融资渠道和风险管理手段。  
  The emergence of receivables significantly promoted the development of commercial credit and drove global trade prosperity. In modern economies, receivables have become an essential part of corporate financial management. With innovations in financial instruments (e.g., factoring, asset securitization), the liquidity of receivables has been further enhanced, providing businesses with more financing channels and risk management tools.
