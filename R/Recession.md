  **中文解释**：经济衰退（Recession）是指一个国家或地区的经济活动显著下降，通常表现为国内生产总值（GDP）连续两个季度或更长时间的负增长。经济衰退通常伴随着失业率上升、消费减少、投资下降和企业利润缩减等现象。这一概念最早由经济学家在20世纪初提出，用于描述经济周期中的下行阶段。  
  **English Explanation**: A recession is a significant decline in economic activity within a country or region, typically characterized by negative GDP growth for two consecutive quarters or more. It is often accompanied by rising unemployment, reduced consumer spending, decreased investment, and declining corporate profits. The term was first introduced by economists in the early 20th century to describe the downturn phase of the economic cycle.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：经济衰退通常出现在经济过热后的调整期，如2008年全球金融危机后的全球经济衰退。在衰退期间，政府可能采取财政刺激政策（如增加公共支出）和货币政策（如降息）来提振经济。投资者需警惕资产价格下跌和信用风险上升的风险。  
  **English Application**: Recessions often occur during the adjustment period following economic overheating, such as the global recession after the 2008 financial crisis. During a recession, governments may implement fiscal stimulus measures (e.g., increased public spending) and monetary policies (e.g., interest rate cuts) to stimulate the economy. Investors should be cautious about declining asset prices and rising credit risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，识别和应对经济衰退是维护金融稳定的关键；从投资角度看，理解衰退周期有助于优化资产配置；从行业角度看，企业需调整战略以应对需求萎缩和成本压力。
