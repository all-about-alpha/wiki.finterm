# Real Estate Operating Company (REOC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：房地产运营公司（Real Estate Operating Company, REOC）是指专注于房地产开发、管理和运营的企业，通常通过购买、开发、租赁和销售房地产资产来获取收益。与房地产投资信托（REITs）不同，REOC不享有税收优惠，且其利润主要来源于房地产项目的运营而非长期持有。  
  **English Explanation**: A Real Estate Operating Company (REOC) is a business entity focused on the development, management, and operation of real estate properties. It typically generates revenue through the acquisition, development, leasing, and sale of real estate assets. Unlike Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), REOCs do not benefit from tax advantages, and their profits primarily stem from the operation of real estate projects rather than long-term holdings.

  **English Application Scenarios**: REOCs are widely used in commercial real estate, residential development, and industrial properties. Companies enhance asset value by developing new projects or renovating existing properties and generate profits through leasing or sales. It is important to note that since REOCs do not enjoy tax benefits, their financial structures may face higher tax burdens.
