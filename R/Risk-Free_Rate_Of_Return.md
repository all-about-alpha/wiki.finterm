# Risk-Free Rate Of Return

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **无风险收益率** 是指投资者在没有任何风险的情况下，预期能够获得的回报率。通常以政府债券（如美国国债）的收益率作为基准，因为这些债券被认为几乎没有违约风险。  
  The **Risk-Free Rate of Return** refers to the return that an investor can expect to earn with zero risk. It is typically benchmarked against government bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds), as these are considered to have virtually no default risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在投资决策中，无风险收益率常被用作计算资本资产定价模型（CAPM）中的基准利率，帮助评估其他投资项目的风险和回报。投资者需注意，虽然政府债券被视为无风险，但在极端经济环境下仍可能存在流动性风险或通胀风险。  
  In investment decisions, the risk-free rate is often used as a benchmark in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to evaluate the risk and return of other investments. Investors should note that while government bonds are considered risk-free, they may still face liquidity or inflation risks in extreme economic conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，无风险收益率是金融市场的重要参考指标，用于制定货币政策和经济政策。从投资角度看，它是评估资产定价和投资组合管理的基础工具。行业层面，它影响贷款利率、企业融资成本等关键经济变量。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the risk-free rate is a crucial reference for financial markets, influencing monetary and economic policies. From an investment standpoint, it serves as a foundational tool for asset pricing and portfolio management. At the industry level, it affects key economic variables such as loan rates and corporate financing costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  无风险收益率的概念起源于20世纪初的金融理论发展期，随着现代投资组合理论的提出而逐渐成型。经济学家哈里·马科维茨（Harry Markowitz）和威廉·夏普（William Sharpe）在其研究中将其作为资本资产定价模型的核心要素之一。  
  The concept of the risk-free rate originated in the early 20th century during the development of financial theory and became formalized with the advent of modern portfolio theory. Economists Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe incorporated it as a core element in their Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
