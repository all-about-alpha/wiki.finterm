# Regulatory Capture

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **监管俘获**（Regulatory Capture）是指监管机构在制定和执行政策时，被其所监管的行业或企业所影响或控制，导致监管行为偏离公共利益，转而服务于被监管者的利益。这一概念最早由经济学家乔治·斯蒂格勒（George Stigler）在1971年提出，核心在于揭示监管者与被监管者之间的利益关系。  
  **Regulatory Capture** refers to a situation where regulatory agencies, in the process of formulating and enforcing policies, are influenced or controlled by the industries or companies they are supposed to regulate. This results in regulatory actions deviating from the public interest and instead serving the interests of the regulated entities. The concept was first introduced by economist George Stigler in 1971, highlighting the relationship between regulators and the regulated.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，监管俘获现象可能出现在金融、能源、电信等关键行业。例如，某些金融机构可能通过游说或利益输送影响监管政策，导致政策偏向于保护行业利益而非消费者权益。风险在于可能导致市场不公平竞争、资源错配以及系统性风险的积累。  
  In China, regulatory capture may occur in key sectors such as finance, energy, and telecommunications. For instance, certain financial institutions might influence regulatory policies through lobbying or benefits transfer, leading to policies that favor industry interests over consumer rights. The risks include unfair market competition, resource misallocation, and the accumulation of systemic risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，识别和防范监管俘获是确保市场公平和效率的关键；从投资角度看，了解这一现象有助于评估行业政策和风险；从产业角度看，避免监管俘获有助于促进行业健康发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, identifying and preventing regulatory capture is crucial for ensuring market fairness and efficiency; from an investment perspective, understanding this phenomenon helps assess industry policies and risks; from an industry perspective, avoiding regulatory capture promotes healthy sector development.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  监管俘获的概念起源于20世纪70年代的美国。乔治·斯蒂格勒在其论文《经济规制理论》中首次提出这一理论，认为政府规制往往会被受规制的行业所利用，从而服务于其自身利益。这一理论后来成为公共选择经济学的重要组成部分。  
  The concept of regulatory capture originated in the United States in the 1970s. George Stigler first introduced this theory in his paper "The Theory of Economic Regulation," arguing that government regulation is often exploited by regulated industries to serve their own interests. This theory later became a key component of public choice economics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在全球范围内，监管俘获现象对金融危机的爆发起到了推波助澜的作用。例如，2008年全球金融危机中，部分金融机构通过影响政策制定规避了有效监管。目前，各国政府和国际组织正加强措施以防范此类现象的发生。  
  Globally, regulatory capture has contributed to financial crises. For example, during the 2008 global financial crisis, some financial institutions influenced policy-making to evade effective regulation. Currently, governments and international organizations are strengthening measures to prevent such occurrences.
