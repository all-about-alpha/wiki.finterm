    定期扣款（Recurring Billing）是一种支付模式，指商家与客户达成协议后，按照约定的周期（如每月、每季度或每年）自动从客户的支付账户中扣除费用。这种模式通常用于订阅服务、会员制或长期合同，如流媒体平台、健身房会员或软件服务（SaaS）。其核心概念在于自动化和周期性，减少了人工干预，提高了支付效率。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Recurring Billing is a payment model where a merchant automatically charges a customer's payment account at agreed intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) based on a prior agreement. This model is commonly used for subscription services, memberships, or long-term contracts, such as streaming platforms, gym memberships, or SaaS (Software as a Service). The core concepts are automation and periodicity, which reduce manual intervention and improve payment efficiency.
