## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **风险溢价**是指投资者因承担额外风险而要求的超过无风险收益率的额外回报。它反映了市场对不确定性的补偿，通常用于衡量投资的风险与收益之间的关系。核心概念包括无风险收益率、市场风险和投资者风险偏好。  
  **Risk Premium** refers to the additional return that investors demand for taking on extra risk beyond the risk-free rate. It reflects the market's compensation for uncertainty and is commonly used to measure the relationship between risk and return in investments. Key concepts include the risk-free rate, market risk, and investor risk appetite.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在投资决策中，风险溢价用于评估股票、债券等资产的预期回报率。例如，股票的风险溢价通常高于债券，因为股票的风险更大。投资者需注意，高溢价可能伴随高风险，需结合自身风险承受能力进行选择。  
  In investment decisions, the risk premium is used to evaluate the expected return of assets such as stocks and bonds. For example, stocks typically have a higher risk premium than bonds due to their greater risk. Investors should note that a high premium may come with high risks and should align their choices with their own risk tolerance.
