# Risk Parity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：风险平价（Risk Parity）是一种资产配置策略，由桥水基金（Bridgewater Associates）的创始人雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）在20世纪90年代提出。其核心理念是通过平衡不同资产类别的风险贡献，而非传统的资本权重，来实现投资组合的优化。具体来说，风险平价策略旨在使股票、债券、商品等各类资产对投资组合的整体风险贡献相等，从而降低单一资产波动对整体组合的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Risk Parity is an asset allocation strategy pioneered by Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, in the 1990s. Its core concept is to optimize a portfolio by balancing the risk contributions of different asset classes rather than using traditional capital weighting. Specifically, the Risk Parity strategy aims to equalize the risk contributions of assets such as stocks, bonds, and commodities to the overall portfolio, thereby reducing the impact of volatility from any single asset.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：风险平价策略广泛应用于养老金、主权财富基金和对冲基金等机构投资者的资产配置中。其优势在于能够在市场波动时提供更稳定的回报，尤其适用于低利率环境或经济不确定性较高的时期。然而，该策略依赖于杠杆的使用来提升低风险资产的回报率，因此需警惕杠杆带来的潜在风险和流动性压力。  
  **English Explanation**: The Risk Parity strategy is widely applied in asset allocation by institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds. Its advantage lies in providing more stable returns during market volatility, particularly in low-interest-rate environments or periods of high economic uncertainty. However, the strategy relies on leverage to enhance returns from low-risk assets, necessitating caution regarding potential risks and liquidity pressures associated with leverage.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，风险平价策略有助于降低系统性风险；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了多元化的风险管理工具；从行业角度看，该策略推动了资产管理行业的创新和发展。特别是在全球金融市场日益复杂的背景下，风险平价策略为投资者提供了一种更为稳健的资产配置方式。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the Risk Parity strategy helps reduce systemic risk; from an investment perspective, it provides investors with diversified risk management tools; and from an industry perspective, it drives innovation and development in asset management. Particularly in the increasingly complex global financial markets, the Risk Parity strategy offers a more robust approach to asset allocation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：风险平价的概念最早由雷·达里奥在20世纪90年代提出并实践于桥水基金的“全天候”（All Weather）投资策略中。达里奥发现传统60/40股债配置无法有效应对不同经济环境下的市场波动，因此提出了通过平衡各类资产的风险贡献来实现更稳定的回报。这一理念逐渐被学术界和业界广泛接受和应用。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Risk Parity was first introduced and implemented by Ray Dalio in the 1990s through Bridgewater Associates' "All Weather" investment strategy. Dalio observed that traditional 60/40 stock-bond allocations were ineffective in managing market volatility across different economic environments. He thus proposed balancing the risk contributions of various assets to achieve more stable returns. This idea gradually gained widespread acceptance and application in both academia and industry.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：风险平价策略对资产管理行业产生了深远影响，推动了多资产配置和风险管理技术的发展。目前，该策略已成为全球机构投资者的重要工具之一，尤其在2008年金融危机后得到进一步推广和应用。同时，它也引发了关于杠杆使用和模型依赖性的讨论与反思。  
  **English Explanation**: The Risk Parity strategy has had a profound impact on the asset management industry, driving advancements in multi-asset allocation and risk management techniques.
