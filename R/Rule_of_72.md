# Rule of 72

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：72法则是一种简化的金融计算工具，用于估算投资本金在特定年化收益率下翻倍所需的时间。其公式为：翻倍时间 = 72 ÷ 年化收益率（%）。该法则由意大利数学家卢卡·帕乔利（Luca Pacioli）在15世纪提出，核心概念是通过简单的除法快速估算复利效应。  
  **English Explanation**: The Rule of 72 is a simplified financial calculation tool used to estimate the time required for an investment to double at a given annual rate of return. The formula is: Doubling Time = 72 ÷ Annual Rate of Return (%). This rule was introduced by Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in the 15th century, with the core concept being a quick estimation of compound interest effects through simple division.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：72法则广泛应用于个人理财、投资规划和金融教育中。例如，投资者可以用它估算在年化收益率为6%的情况下，本金翻倍需要12年（72 ÷ 6 = 12）。需要注意的是，该法则仅适用于固定收益率且未考虑税收、通胀等因素，实际结果可能与估算值存在偏差。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: The Rule of 72 is widely used in personal finance, investment planning, and financial education. For example, an investor can use it to estimate that at an annual return of 6%, the principal will double in 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12). It’s important to note that this rule applies only to fixed rates of return and does not account for taxes, inflation, or other factors, so actual results may differ from estimates.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，72法则因其简单易用而成为普及金融知识的重要工具。它帮助投资者快速理解复利的力量，从而做出更明智的财务决策。同时，它也是金融教育中的基础概念之一。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Rule of 72 is an essential tool for promoting financial literacy due to its simplicity. It helps investors quickly grasp the power of compound interest, enabling them to make more informed financial decisions. Additionally, it is a foundational concept in financial education.
