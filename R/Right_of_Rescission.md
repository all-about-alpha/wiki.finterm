## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  撤销权的概念最早可追溯到古罗马法中的“解除契约”原则，后来在近代民法体系中得到进一步发展。20世纪以来，随着消费者保护运动的兴起，许多国家在法律中明确规定了撤销权条款。中国在《合同法》和《消费者权益保护法》中也引入了这一制度。  
  The concept of the Right of Rescission can be traced back to the principle of "contract dissolution" in ancient Roman law, which was further developed in modern civil law systems. Since the 20th century, with the rise of consumer protection movements, many countries have explicitly included this right in their legal frameworks. China has also introduced this system in its Contract Law and Consumer Protection Law.
