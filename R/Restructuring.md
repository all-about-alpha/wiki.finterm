## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：重组的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的美国，当时企业为应对经济危机和市场竞争，开始尝试通过调整业务和资产结构来提升竞争力。20世纪80年代，随着杠杆收购（LBO）和敌意收购的兴起，重组成为企业应对并购压力的重要策略。中国在20世纪90年代引入重组概念，主要用于国有企业改革和不良资产处置。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of restructuring dates back to the early 20th century in the United States, when companies began adjusting their business and asset structures to enhance competitiveness in response to economic crises and market competition. In the 1980s, with the rise of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and hostile takeovers, restructuring became a key strategy for companies to address acquisition pressures. China introduced the concept of restructuring in the 1990s, primarily for state-owned enterprise reforms and non-performing asset disposal.

  **English Impact**: Restructuring has had a profound impact on global enterprises. In the United States, restructuring helped many companies survive financial crises, such as General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis.
