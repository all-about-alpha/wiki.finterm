## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：风险度量是指用于量化和管理金融风险的一系列方法和工具。其核心概念包括风险的识别、评估和控制，常用的度量指标有VaR（在险价值）、标准差、贝塔系数等。这一概念最早由现代投资组合理论的奠基人哈里·马科维茨（Harry Markowitz）提出，并在后续的金融研究中不断完善。  
  **English Explanation**: Risk measures refer to a set of methods and tools used to quantify and manage financial risks. Core concepts include risk identification, assessment, and control, with common metrics such as VaR (Value at Risk), standard deviation, and beta coefficient. This concept was initially introduced by Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory, and has been refined in subsequent financial research.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：风险度量广泛应用于投资组合管理、金融机构的风险控制以及企业财务决策中。例如，银行使用VaR来评估市场风险，保险公司用极端值理论衡量巨灾风险。需要注意的是，不同风险度量方法有其局限性，需结合实际情况选择合适工具。  
  **English Explanation**: Risk measures are widely applied in portfolio management, risk control in financial institutions, and corporate financial decision-making. For instance, banks use VaR to assess market risk, while insurance companies employ extreme value theory to measure catastrophic risks. It is important to note that different risk measures have limitations and should be chosen based on specific contexts.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，风险度量是金融机构合规的重要工具；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者优化资产配置；从行业角度看，它是风险管理体系的核心组成部分。有效的风险度量能够提升市场透明度和稳定性。

Effective risk measures enhance market transparency and stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：风险度量的概念起源于20世纪50年代哈里·马科维茨的现代投资组合理论（MPT）。他首次提出用方差来衡量投资组合的风险，为后续的风险度量研究奠定了基础。20世纪90年代，VaR模型由JP摩根公司推广，成为市场风险的标准化工具。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of risk measures originated in the 1950s with Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). He introduced the use of variance to measure portfolio risk, laying the foundation for subsequent research. In the 1990s, the VaR model was popularized by J.P. Morgan as a standardized tool for market risk.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：风险度量的发展深刻影响了全球金融行业。它不仅成为金融机构内部管理的核心工具，还被纳入巴塞尔协议等国际监管框架中。目前，随着金融市场的复杂化，风险度量方法也在不断演进以适应新挑战。
