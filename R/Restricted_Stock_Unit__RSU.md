# Restricted Stock Unit (RSU)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：限制性股票单位（RSU）是一种员工激励计划，公司授予员工一定数量的股票单位，但这些单位在特定条件（如工作年限或业绩目标）满足后才能转换为实际股票。RSU通常用于吸引和留住关键人才，同时与公司的长期发展目标保持一致。  
  **English Explanation**: A Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) is an employee incentive plan where a company grants a certain number of stock units to employees, which can only be converted into actual shares upon meeting specific conditions (such as tenure or performance goals). RSUs are commonly used to attract and retain key talent while aligning with the company's long-term development objectives.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：RSU广泛应用于科技、金融等高薪行业，作为薪酬包的一部分。员工在满足归属条件后获得股票，但需注意税务问题，因为归属时可能产生应税收入。此外，RSU的价值随公司股价波动，存在市场风险。  
  **English Application**: RSUs are widely used in high-paying industries such as technology and finance as part of compensation packages. Employees receive shares upon meeting vesting conditions but must be aware of tax implications, as vesting may trigger taxable income. Additionally, the value of RSUs fluctuates with the company's stock price, introducing market risk.
