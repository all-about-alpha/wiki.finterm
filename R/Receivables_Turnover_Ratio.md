# Receivables Turnover Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：应收账款周转率（Receivables Turnover Ratio）是衡量企业在一定期间内应收账款转化为现金的效率的财务指标。它反映了企业收回应收账款的速度，通常通过将净赊销收入除以平均应收账款余额来计算。该比率越高，表明企业收回应收账款的速度越快，资金周转效率越高。  
  **English Explanation**: The Receivables Turnover Ratio is a financial metric that measures the efficiency with which a company converts its accounts receivable into cash over a specific period. It indicates how quickly a company collects its receivables and is typically calculated by dividing net credit sales by the average accounts receivable balance. A higher ratio suggests that the company is collecting its receivables more quickly, indicating better liquidity management.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：应收账款周转率广泛应用于企业的财务分析中，特别是在评估企业的信用政策和收款效率时。高比率可能表明企业有严格的信用政策或高效的收款流程，但也可能意味着企业过于依赖短期融资。低比率则可能暗示企业在收款方面存在问题，如客户拖欠或信用政策过于宽松。投资者和债权人常用此指标来评估企业的财务健康状况和流动性风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The Receivables Turnover Ratio is widely used in financial analysis, particularly in evaluating a company's credit policies and collection efficiency. A high ratio may indicate strict credit policies or efficient collection processes but could also suggest over-reliance on short-term financing. A low ratio may signal issues with collections, such as customer defaults or overly lenient credit policies. Investors and creditors often use this metric to assess a company's financial health and liquidity risk.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，应收账款周转率是衡量企业运营效率和财务稳健性的重要指标。高比率通常被视为积极的信号，表明企业能够快速将应收账款转化为现金，从而减少坏账风险并提高资金使用效率。然而，过高的比率也可能意味着企业过于保守的信用政策，可能影响销售增长。因此，企业在追求高周转率的同时，也需平衡销售与风险控制之间的关系。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Receivables Turnover Ratio is a crucial metric for assessing operational efficiency and financial stability. A high ratio is generally seen as positive, indicating that the company can quickly convert receivables into cash, reducing bad debt risk and improving capital efficiency. However, an excessively high ratio may suggest overly conservative credit policies that could hinder sales growth. Therefore, while pursuing a high turnover ratio, companies must balance sales growth with risk management.
