# Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    住房抵押贷款支持证券（Residential Mortgage-Backed Security, RMBS）是一种由住房抵押贷款作为基础资产的金融工具。发行机构（如银行或金融机构）将大量住房抵押贷款打包，形成一个资产池，然后以该资产池为基础发行证券。投资者购买这些证券后，可以获得来自抵押贷款还款的现金流。RMBS的核心概念是将分散的住房抵押贷款集中化，并通过证券化的方式分散风险。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS) is a financial instrument backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans. Issuers (such as banks or financial institutions) bundle a large number of mortgage loans into an asset pool and issue securities based on this pool. Investors who purchase these securities receive cash flows from the mortgage repayments. The core concept of RMBS is to centralize dispersed mortgage loans and distribute risks through securitization.
