# Rabbi Trust

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Rabbi Trust是一种不可撤销的信托安排，通常由公司设立，用于为高管或关键员工提供递延薪酬或退休福利。该信托的资金独立于公司的资产，但仍受公司债权人的追索权影响。其名称源于1980年代美国国税局（IRS）首次批准此类信托时涉及的犹太教拉比（Rabbi）案例。  
  **English Explanation**: A Rabbi Trust is an irrevocable trust arrangement typically established by a company to provide deferred compensation or retirement benefits for executives or key employees. The trust's assets are separate from the company's assets but remain subject to the claims of the company's creditors. The name originates from a case involving a rabbi in the 1980s, when the IRS first approved this type of trust.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Rabbi Trust常用于企业为高管提供长期激励计划或退休福利，确保资金安全且独立于公司运营风险。然而，由于信托资产在公司破产时可能被债权人追索，其安全性并非绝对。适用于希望保留税务优惠同时提供福利的企业。  
  **English Application**: Rabbi Trusts are often used by companies to provide long-term incentive plans or retirement benefits for executives, ensuring that funds are secure and separate from operational risks. However, since trust assets may be claimed by creditors in the event of bankruptcy, their security is not absolute. They are suitable for companies seeking to retain tax advantages while offering benefits.

  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Rabbi Trusts comply with tax laws and provide companies with a legitimate tool for deferred compensation.
