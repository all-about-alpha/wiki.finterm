# Rule of 78

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “78法则”是一种用于计算贷款提前还款时利息分配的方法。其名称来源于1到12个月的数字之和为78（即1+2+3+…+12=78）。该方法假设贷款利息在还款期内按比例分配，前期支付的利息较多，后期较少。  
  **English Explanation**: The "Rule of 78" is a method used to calculate the allocation of interest when a loan is repaid early. Its name derives from the sum of the digits from 1 to 12, which equals 78 (i.e., 1+2+3+…+12=78). This method assumes that interest is distributed proportionally over the loan term, with more interest paid in the early stages and less in the later stages.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: “78法则”常用于分期贷款或消费信贷中，特别是在借款人提前还款时计算剩余利息。需要注意的是，这种方法对借款人不利，因为前期支付的利息比例较高，可能导致提前还款时节省的利息较少。  
  **English Application**: The Rule of 78 is commonly used in installment loans or consumer credit, especially when calculating remaining interest for early repayment. It’s important to note that this method is less favorable to borrowers, as a higher proportion of interest is paid upfront, potentially reducing savings from early repayment.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: “78法则”在金融行业中曾广泛使用，但随着消费者保护意识的增强和监管政策的完善，许多国家和地区已限制或禁止其使用。它提醒借款人在签订贷款合同时需仔细了解利息计算方式。  
  **English Significance**: The Rule of 78 was widely used in the financial industry, but with increased consumer protection awareness and regulatory improvements, many regions have restricted or banned its use. It serves as a reminder for borrowers to carefully understand interest calculation methods when signing loan agreements.
