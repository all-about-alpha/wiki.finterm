# Real Estate Owned (REO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 银行或其他金融机构持有的不动产（Real Estate Owned, REO）是指通过止赎程序收回的房产，通常是因为借款人未能按时偿还贷款。这些房产由金融机构持有，直到它们被出售或处置。  
  **English Explanation**: Real Estate Owned (REO) refers to properties that have been repossessed by banks or other financial institutions through foreclosure proceedings, typically due to the borrower's failure to repay the loan. These properties are held by the institution until they are sold or otherwise disposed of.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: REO房产通常由银行或金融机构在市场上出售，价格可能低于市场价以吸引买家。投资者和购房者可以通过购买REO房产获得潜在的投资回报或低价购房机会。然而，购买REO房产也存在风险，如房屋状况不佳、法律问题等。  
  **English Explanation**: REO properties are typically sold by banks or financial institutions on the market, often at prices below market value to attract buyers. Investors and homebuyers can potentially gain investment returns or purchase homes at lower prices by acquiring REO properties. However, purchasing REO properties also carries risks, such as poor property conditions and legal issues.

  **English Explanation**: REO properties play a significant role in the real estate market, especially during economic downturns or real estate market slumps. They provide additional supply to the market, helping to stabilize property prices.
