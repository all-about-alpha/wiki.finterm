# Regressive Tax

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 累退税（Regressive Tax）是一种税收制度，其税率随着纳税人收入的增加而递减。这意味着低收入者相对于高收入者承担了更高的税负比例。累退税的核心概念是税收负担的不平等分配，通常体现在消费税、销售税等间接税种中。  
  **English Explanation**: A regressive tax is a tax system where the tax rate decreases as the taxpayer's income increases. This means that low-income individuals bear a higher proportion of the tax burden compared to high-income earners. The core concept of a regressive tax is the unequal distribution of tax burden, often seen in indirect taxes such as consumption taxes and sales taxes.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 累退税常见于消费税、增值税和某些财产税中。例如，购买日常消费品时，无论收入高低，消费者支付的税率相同，但低收入者因此类支出占其收入比例较高而承受更大压力。需要注意的是，累退税可能加剧社会贫富差距，影响经济公平性。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Regressive taxes are commonly applied in consumption taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), and certain property taxes. For instance, when purchasing daily consumer goods, all consumers pay the same tax rate regardless of income level, but low-income individuals face greater pressure as such expenses constitute a higher proportion of their income. It is important to note that regressive taxes may exacerbate social inequality and impact economic fairness.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，累退税可能被视为一种不公平的税收制度，因为它对低收入群体造成更大负担。在投资和行业层面，累退税可能影响消费行为和市场结构。例如，高额的消费税可能抑制低收入者的消费能力，从而影响相关行业的发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, regressive taxes may be viewed as an unfair taxation system due to their disproportionate burden on low-income groups. In terms of investment and industry, regressive taxes can influence consumer behavior and market structure. For example, high consumption taxes may suppress the purchasing power of low-income individuals, thereby affecting the development of related industries.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 累退税的概念可以追溯到古代社会的税收制度。例如，古罗马时期的“人头税”就是一种典型的累退税形式，无论贫富均需缴纳相同金额的税款。现代社会中，累退税的形式更加多样化，但其核心特征——对低收入者的不公平负担——始终存在。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of regressive taxation dates back to ancient taxation systems. For instance, the "poll tax" in ancient Rome was a typical form of regressive tax where everyone paid the same amount regardless of wealth. In modern society, forms of regressive taxation have diversified, but their core characteristic—unfair burden on low-income individuals—remains consistent.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: 累退税在历史上曾引发多次社会不满和改革运动。例如，英国历史上的人头税骚乱就是因累退性质的人头税引发的社会动荡。如今，许多国家通过调整税收政策来减轻累退税的影响，但这一问题在全球范围内仍未完全解决。  
  **English Impact**: Regressive taxation has historically sparked social discontent and reform movements. For example, the Poll Tax Riots in UK history were caused by social unrest over the regressive nature of poll taxes. Today, many countries adjust their tax policies to mitigate the effects of regressive taxation, but this issue remains unresolved globally.
