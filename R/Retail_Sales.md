## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  零售销售的统计起源于20世纪初的工业化国家，随着大规模生产和消费社会的兴起，政府和企业开始系统地收集和分析零售数据以指导经济活动。在中国，现代意义上的零售销售统计体系是在改革开放后逐步建立和完善的，特别是在加入世界贸易组织（WTO）后，中国与国际接轨的统计方法进一步提升了数据的准确性和可比性。  
  The statistics of retail sales originated in industrialized countries in the early 20th century. With the rise of mass production and consumer society, governments and businesses began systematically collecting and analyzing retail data to guide economic activities. In China, the modern retail sales statistical system was gradually established and improved after the reform and opening-up policy. Especially after joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's alignment with international statistical methods further enhanced the accuracy and comparability of its data.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，零售销售数据的发布对市场情绪和投资决策具有重要影响。例如，“双十一”购物节期间的零售销售额常常被视为中国消费市场活力的晴雨表。在全球范围内，中国的零售销售数据也受到国际投资者和企业的关注，因为它反映了全球第二大经济体的消费能力和市场潜力。  
  In China, the release of retail sales data has a significant impact on market sentiment and investment decisions. For example, retail sales during the "Double Eleven" shopping festival are often seen as a barometer of the vitality of China's consumer market. Globally, China's retail sales data is also closely watched by international investors and businesses as it reflects the consumption capacity and market potential of the world's second-largest economy.
