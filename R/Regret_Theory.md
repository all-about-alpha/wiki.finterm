# Regret Theory

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **后悔理论**（Regret Theory）由心理学家Graham Loomes和Robert Sugden于1982年提出，是行为经济学中的一个重要理论。该理论认为，人们在做出决策时，不仅会考虑结果本身，还会考虑如果选择其他选项可能带来的后悔或满足感。核心概念是“后悔”和“欣喜”，即对未选择选项的潜在情感反应。  
  **Regret Theory**, proposed by psychologists Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden in 1982, is a significant theory in behavioral economics. It suggests that when making decisions, people not only consider the outcomes themselves but also the potential regret or satisfaction they might feel if they had chosen differently. The core concepts are "regret" and "rejoicing," which refer to the emotional responses to unchosen alternatives.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在投资决策中，后悔理论常被用来解释投资者为何倾向于避免可能导致后悔的行为，如卖出亏损股票或错过高收益机会。例如，投资者可能因害怕未来股价上涨而持有亏损股票，以避免“卖错”的后悔感。然而，这种心理可能导致“损失厌恶”和过度保守的投资策略。  
  In investment decision-making, Regret Theory is often used to explain why investors tend to avoid actions that might lead to regret, such as selling losing stocks or missing high-return opportunities. For instance, investors may hold onto losing stocks to avoid the regret of "selling too early," even if it leads to further losses. However, this mindset can result in "loss aversion" and overly conservative investment strategies.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，理解后悔理论有助于设计更有效的投资者保护机制；从投资角度看，它揭示了非理性行为背后的心理动因；从行业角度看，金融机构可利用这一理论优化产品设计和客户沟通策略。  
  From a regulatory perspective, understanding Regret Theory helps design more effective investor protection mechanisms; from an investment perspective, it reveals the psychological motivations behind irrational behaviors; from an industry perspective, financial institutions can use this theory to optimize product design and client communication strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  后悔理论的提出源于20世纪80年代行为经济学的兴起。Graham Loomes和Robert Sugden在研究人类决策行为时发现，传统经济学模型无法完全解释人们在不确定条件下的选择偏差。他们通过实验和理论研究提出了这一理论，填补了传统期望效用理论的不足。  
  Regret Theory emerged during the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s. Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden discovered that traditional economic models could not fully explain decision-making biases under uncertainty. Through experiments and theoretical research, they proposed this theory to address the limitations of traditional expected utility theory.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  后悔理论对金融行业产生了深远影响，特别是在行为金融学领域。它帮助解释了市场中的诸多异常现象，如过度交易、羊群效应等。如今，该理论已被广泛应用于投资策略设计、风险管理以及消费者行为研究等领域。  
  Regret Theory has had a profound impact on the financial industry, particularly in behavioral finance. It has helped explain many market anomalies, such as overtrading and herd behavior. Today, the theory is widely applied in investment strategy design, risk management, and consumer behavior research.
