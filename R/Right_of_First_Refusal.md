# Right of First Refusal

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：优先购买权（Right of First Refusal）是指在特定交易中，某一方（通常是现有股东、合作伙伴或承租人）在第三方提出购买或租赁某项资产时，享有优先于第三方购买或租赁该资产的权利。这一权利通常通过合同条款约定，旨在保护现有利益相关者的权益，防止资产被外部竞争者获取。  
  **English Explanation**: The Right of First Refusal (ROFR) is a contractual right that grants a party (typically an existing shareholder, partner, or tenant) the priority to purchase or lease an asset before it is offered to a third party. This right is designed to protect the interests of existing stakeholders by preventing the asset from being acquired by external competitors.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：优先购买权常见于股权转让、房地产交易、知识产权许可等领域。例如，在公司股权转让中，现有股东可能享有优先购买权，以确保公司控制权不被外部投资者轻易获取。在房地产租赁中，承租人可能享有优先购买权，以便在房东出售房产时优先购买。需要注意的是，优先购买权的行使通常有时间限制，且可能涉及复杂的法律程序。  
  **English Application**: The Right of First Refusal is commonly used in equity transfers, real estate transactions, and intellectual property licensing. For instance, in equity transfers, existing shareholders may have the ROFR to ensure that control of the company is not easily acquired by external investors. In real estate leasing, tenants may have the ROFR to purchase the property before it is sold to others. It is important to note that exercising the ROFR often involves time constraints and complex legal procedures.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，优先购买权有助于维护市场秩序，防止恶意收购或资产流失。从投资角度看，它为现有投资者提供了额外的保护，确保其在关键交易中的优先地位。从行业角度看，优先购买权促进了长期合作关系的稳定，减少了因资产转移带来的不确定性。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the ROFR helps maintain market order and prevents hostile takeovers or asset loss. From an investment standpoint, it provides additional protection for existing investors, ensuring their priority in critical transactions. From an industry perspective, the ROFR fosters stability in long-term partnerships and reduces uncertainty caused by asset transfers.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：优先购买权的概念可以追溯到中世纪欧洲的土地交易。当时，封建领主为了保护自己的土地权益，赋予佃户优先购买土地的权利。这一制度后来被引入商业领域，成为现代公司法中的重要条款。20世纪初，随着公司法和合同法的完善，优先购买权逐渐被广泛应用于股权交易和商业合作中。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of the Right of First Refusal dates back to medieval European land transactions. At that time, feudal lords granted tenants the ROFR to protect their land interests. This practice was later adopted in the commercial sector and became a key provision in modern corporate law. In the early 20th century, with the development of corporate and contract law, the ROFR became widely used in equity transactions and business partnerships.
