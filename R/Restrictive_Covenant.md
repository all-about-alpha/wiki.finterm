  **English Explanation**: A restrictive covenant is a clause in a contract or agreement that imposes specific limitations or constraints on one party, typically to protect the interests of the other party or ensure the fulfillment of the contract. These clauses are commonly found in loan agreements, employment contracts, real estate transactions, and business cooperation agreements, aiming to restrict certain actions or activities, such as prohibiting competition, limiting information disclosure, or specifying timeframes for specific behaviors.
