# Risk/Reward Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **风险/收益比** 是金融投资中用于衡量潜在收益与潜在风险之间关系的指标。它通过比较投资者可能获得的回报与可能承担的风险，帮助投资者评估投资决策的合理性。该概念最早由现代投资理论提出，核心在于量化风险和收益的平衡。  
  The **Risk/Reward Ratio** is a financial metric used to evaluate the relationship between potential returns and potential risks in an investment. It compares the possible rewards an investor might gain against the risks they might take, aiding in the assessment of investment decisions. This concept originated from modern investment theory, focusing on quantifying the balance between risk and reward.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文语境中，风险/收益比常用于股票、基金、期货等投资领域。投资者通过计算该比率，判断某项投资是否值得进行。例如，在股票交易中，如果一只股票的潜在收益是10%，而潜在亏损是5%，则其风险/收益比为1:2。需要注意的是，该比率仅提供参考，实际投资还需结合市场环境和个人风险承受能力。  
  In English contexts, the Risk/Reward Ratio is widely used in investments such as stocks, funds, and futures. Investors calculate this ratio to determine whether an investment is worthwhile. For example, in stock trading, if a stock has a potential return of 10% and a potential loss of 5%, its Risk/Reward Ratio is 1:2. It’s important to note that this ratio is only a reference; actual investments should also consider market conditions and individual risk tolerance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从中文视角看，风险/收益比在监管、投资和行业层面具有重要意义。监管机构鼓励投资者使用该工具以降低系统性风险；投资者依赖其优化资产配置；行业则将其作为衡量产品吸引力的标准之一。  
  From an English perspective, the Risk/Reward Ratio holds significant importance in regulation, investment, and industry. Regulatory bodies encourage its use to mitigate systemic risks; investors rely on it to optimize asset allocation; and industries adopt it as a standard for measuring product attractiveness.
