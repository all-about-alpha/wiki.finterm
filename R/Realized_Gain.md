# Realized Gain

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：已实现收益（Realized Gain）是指通过出售或处置资产（如股票、债券、房地产等）所获得的实际利润。其核心概念在于，只有当资产被实际出售或处置时，收益才被视为“已实现”，而非仅仅是账面价值的增加。  
  **English Explanation**: Realized Gain refers to the actual profit obtained from selling or disposing of an asset (such as stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). The core concept is that the gain is only considered "realized" when the asset is actually sold or disposed of, rather than just an increase in book value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：已实现收益常见于投资组合管理、税务规划和财务报告中。例如，投资者在出售股票后计算资本利得税时，需明确区分已实现收益和未实现收益。风险提示：已实现收益可能触发税务义务，投资者需提前规划以避免不必要的税负。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Realized Gain is commonly seen in portfolio management, tax planning, and financial reporting. For example, when investors calculate capital gains tax after selling stocks, they need to clearly distinguish between realized and unrealized gains. Risk Note: Realized gains may trigger tax obligations, and investors should plan ahead to avoid unnecessary tax burdens.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，已实现收益是税务部门征收资本利得税的依据；从投资角度看，它反映了投资者的实际盈利水平；从行业角度看，它是衡量资产管理公司绩效的重要指标之一。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, realized gains are the basis for tax authorities to levy capital gains taxes; from an investment perspective, they reflect the actual profitability of investors; from an industry perspective, they are one of the key metrics for evaluating the performance of asset management companies.
