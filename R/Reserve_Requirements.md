# Reserve Requirements

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  存款准备金率（Reserve Requirements）是指中央银行规定的商业银行必须持有的最低准备金比例，以确保银行体系的流动性和稳定性。这一比例通常以存款总额的百分比表示，由中央银行根据经济形势和货币政策目标进行调整。核心概念包括流动性管理、货币供应量控制和金融风险防范。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Reserve Requirements refer to the minimum percentage of deposits that commercial banks are required to hold as reserves, as mandated by the central bank, to ensure liquidity and stability in the banking system. This ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of total deposits and is adjusted by the central bank based on economic conditions and monetary policy objectives. Key concepts include liquidity management, money supply control, and financial risk mitigation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  存款准备金率广泛应用于货币政策调控中。当中央银行希望收紧流动性时，会提高准备金率，减少银行可贷资金；反之，降低准备金率可增加市场流动性。例如，在经济过热时，提高准备金率有助于抑制通胀；在经济低迷时，降低准备金率可刺激信贷和投资。需要注意的是，过高的准备金率可能限制银行盈利能力，而过低则可能增加金融风险。  
  **English Application**：  
  Reserve Requirements are widely used in monetary policy regulation. When the central bank aims to tighten liquidity, it raises the reserve ratio, reducing the funds available for lending by banks. Conversely, lowering the reserve ratio increases market liquidity. For example, during economic overheating, raising the reserve ratio helps curb inflation, while lowering it during economic downturns can stimulate credit and investment. It is important to note that excessively high reserve ratios may limit banks' profitability, while excessively low ratios may increase financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  存款准备金率是中央银行实施货币政策的重要工具之一，对金融体系的稳定性和货币供应量具有直接影响。从监管角度看，它有助于防范银行挤兑和系统性风险；从投资角度看，它影响市场流动性和资金成本；从行业角度看，它决定了银行的信贷能力和盈利能力。  
  **English Significance**：  
  Reserve Requirements are one of the key tools for central banks to implement monetary policy, directly impacting the stability of the financial system and the money supply. From a regulatory perspective, they help prevent bank runs and systemic risks; from an investment perspective, they influence market liquidity and funding costs; and from an industry perspective, they determine banks' lending capacity and profitability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  存款准备金制度的起源可以追溯到19世纪的美国。1863年，美国《国家银行法》首次规定了银行必须持有一定比例的存款准备金。这一制度的初衷是为了防止银行过度放贷，确保银行在面临挤兑时能够满足客户的提款需求。20世纪初，美联储成立后，准备金制度逐渐成为全球中央银行调控货币政策的标准化工具。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The origin of reserve requirements dates back to 19th-century America. The National Bank Act of 1863 first mandated that banks hold a certain percentage of deposits as reserves. The initial purpose of this system was to prevent banks from over-lending and to ensure they could meet customer withdrawal demands during bank runs. In the early 20th century, after the establishment of the Federal Reserve, reserve requirements gradually became a standardized tool for central banks worldwide to regulate monetary policy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  存款准备金制度对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。它不仅是中央银行调控货币供应量的核心工具，还在2008年全球金融危机后成为防范系统性风险的重要手段。目前，许多国家将准备金率与其他货币政策工具（如利率和公开市场操作）结合使用，以应对复杂的经济环境。  
  **English Impact**：  
  The reserve requirement system has had a profound impact on the global financial system. It is not only a core tool for central banks to regulate the money supply but also became a critical measure to prevent systemic risks after the 2008 global financial crisis. Currently, many countries combine reserve requirements with other monetary policy tools, such as interest rates and open market operations, to address complex economic environments.
