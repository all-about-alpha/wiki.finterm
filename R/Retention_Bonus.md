## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：留任奖金的概念起源于20世纪80年代的企业并购潮。当时，许多企业发现并购后关键人才的流失严重影响了整合效果，因此开始采用留任奖金作为激励手段。例如，1989年KKR收购RJR Nabisco时，就向高管支付了高额留任奖金。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of retention bonuses emerged during the merger wave of the 1980s. At that time, many companies realized that the loss of key talent post-merger severely impacted integration efforts, leading to the adoption of retention bonuses as an incentive. For example, during KKR's acquisition of RJR Nabisco in 1989, significant retention bonuses were paid to executives.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：留任奖金现已成为全球企业并购和重组中的常见工具。在中国，随着企业国际化进程加快，留任奖金在跨境并购中的应用也日益增多。然而，其高额支付也引发了对薪酬公平性和企业成本的讨论。  
  **English Impact**: Retention bonuses have become a common tool in global mergers and acquisitions.
