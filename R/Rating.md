## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：评级（Rating）是指由专业机构或组织对某一实体（如企业、政府、金融产品等）的信用状况、财务健康度或风险水平进行评估并赋予相应等级的过程。评级的核心概念包括信用风险、偿债能力和市场表现。常见的评级机构包括标准普尔（S&P）、穆迪（Moody's）和惠誉（Fitch）。  
  **English Explanation**: Rating refers to the process by which a professional agency or organization evaluates the creditworthiness, financial health, or risk level of an entity (such as a company, government, or financial product) and assigns it a corresponding grade. Core concepts include credit risk, debt repayment ability, and market performance. Common rating agencies include Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's, and Fitch.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：评级广泛应用于债券发行、银行贷款、投资决策和风险管理等领域。例如，投资者依赖信用评级来评估债券的违约风险，银行则利用评级决定贷款利率。需要注意的是，评级并非绝对准确，可能受到市场波动或机构主观判断的影响。  
  **English Application**: Ratings are widely used in bond issuance, bank lending, investment decisions, and risk management. For instance, investors rely on credit ratings to assess the default risk of bonds, while banks use ratings to determine loan interest rates. It is important to note that ratings are not infallible and may be influenced by market fluctuations or subjective judgments by agencies.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，评级是金融市场透明度和稳定性的重要工具；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了决策依据；从行业角度看，评级推动了资本市场的健康发展。然而，过度依赖评级也可能导致系统性风险，如2008年金融危机中暴露的问题。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, ratings are crucial tools for transparency and stability in financial markets; from an investment perspective, they provide decision-making references for investors; from an industry perspective, they promote the healthy development of capital markets. However, over-reliance on ratings can lead to systemic risks, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：现代信用评级的起源可追溯到19世纪末的美国。1909年，约翰·穆迪（John Moody）首次发布了铁路债券的评级报告，标志着系统化评级的开始。此后，标准普尔和惠誉等机构相继成立，逐步形成了全球化的评级体系。  
  **English Origin**: The modern credit rating system originated in the late 19th century in the United States.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：评级对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。它不仅为投资者提供了风险评估工具，还成为各国政府和企业在国际资本市场融资的重要参考。然而，评级的权威性也因金融危机中的失误而受到质疑，促使监管机构加强了对评级行业的监督。  
  **English Impact**: Ratings have had a profound impact on global financial markets. They not only provide investors with risk assessment tools but also serve as critical references for governments and corporations seeking financing in international capital markets.
