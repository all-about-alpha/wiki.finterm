## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：接管（Receivership）是一种法律程序，通常由法院或债权人指定一名接管人（Receiver）来管理和控制债务人的资产，以确保债权人的利益得到保护。接管人可以是个人或机构，其职责包括清算资产、偿还债务或重组企业。  
  **English Explanation**: Receivership is a legal process in which a court or creditor appoints a receiver to manage and control the assets of a debtor to protect the interests of creditors. The receiver, who can be an individual or an institution, is responsible for liquidating assets, repaying debts, or reorganizing the business.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：接管通常应用于企业破产、债务违约或财务困境时，以确保债权人能够收回部分或全部债务。例如，当一家公司无法偿还贷款时，银行可能会申请法院指定接管人来处理公司资产。需要注意的是，接管可能导致企业停止运营或资产被低价出售。  
  **English Application**: Receivership is commonly applied in cases of corporate bankruptcy, debt default, or financial distress to ensure creditors can recover part or all of their debts. For instance, when a company fails to repay a loan, a bank may petition the court to appoint a receiver to handle the company's assets. It is important to note that receivership may lead to the cessation of business operations or the sale of assets at low prices.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **中文起源**：接管的起源可以追溯到中世纪欧洲的商人法（Lex Mercatoria），当时商人之间出现债务纠纷时，会由第三方来管理债务人的财产以偿还债务。19世纪工业革命后，随着企业规模的扩大和金融市场的复杂化，接管制度逐渐被纳入现代法律体系。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of receivership can be traced back to medieval Europe's Lex Mercatoria (Merchant Law), where third parties would manage debtors' properties to settle disputes between merchants. After the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, as businesses grew larger and financial markets became more complex, receivership was gradually incorporated into modern legal systems.
