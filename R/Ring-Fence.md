# Ring-Fence

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Ring-Fence（隔离机制）是一种金融监管或公司治理手段，旨在将特定资产、负债或业务与其他部分隔离开来，以保护其免受外部风险的影响。这一概念最早由英国金融监管机构提出，核心在于通过法律或合同手段确保某些资源或业务的独立性。  
  **English Explanation**: Ring-Fence is a financial regulation or corporate governance mechanism designed to isolate specific assets, liabilities, or operations from the rest of the entity to protect them from external risks. This concept was initially introduced by UK financial regulators, with its core principle being the legal or contractual assurance of the independence of certain resources or operations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在银行业中，Ring-Fence常用于隔离零售银行业务与投资银行业务，以防止系统性风险。例如，英国《2013年金融服务（银行改革）法案》要求大型银行将零售业务与高风险业务分开。此外，Ring-Fence也用于保险、资产管理等领域，确保客户资金安全。需注意过度隔离可能导致效率降低和成本增加。  
  **English Application**: In banking, Ring-Fence is often used to separate retail banking from investment banking to prevent systemic risks. For example, the UK's Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 requires large banks to segregate retail operations from high-risk activities. Additionally, Ring-Fence is applied in insurance and asset management to safeguard client funds. However, excessive isolation may lead to reduced efficiency and increased costs.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，Ring-Fence有助于增强金融系统的稳定性；从投资角度看，它降低了投资者面临的风险；从行业角度看，它促进了透明度和责任划分。特别是在金融危机后，这一机制被视为防范系统性风险的重要工具。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Ring-Fence enhances the stability of the financial system; from an investment standpoint, it reduces risks for investors; and from an industry viewpoint, it promotes transparency and accountability. Especially after financial crises, this mechanism is regarded as a crucial tool for preventing systemic risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：Ring-Fence的概念起源于20世纪80年代的英国银行业改革。2008年全球金融危机后，英国政府为应对“大而不能倒”问题，于2011年委托约翰·维克斯爵士（Sir John Vickers）领导独立委员会提出银行改革建议。2013年，《金融服务（银行改革）法案》正式引入Ring-Fence机制。
