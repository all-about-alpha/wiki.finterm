# Mill Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Mill Rate，中文称为“千分率”或“税率千分比”，是用于计算财产税的一种比率。它表示每1,000美元（或其他货币单位）的财产评估价值中需要缴纳的税款金额。例如，如果Mill Rate为20，则每1,000美元的财产价值需缴纳20美元的税款。  
  **English Explanation**: The Mill Rate, also known as the "millage rate," is a tax rate used to calculate property taxes. It represents the amount of tax payable per $1,000 (or other currency unit) of assessed property value. For example, if the Mill Rate is 20, then $20 in taxes is owed for every $1,000 of property value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Mill Rate广泛应用于地方政府对房产、土地等不动产的征税过程中。它是确定纳税人应缴税额的关键指标，通常由地方政府根据预算需求和财产评估结果设定。需要注意的是，Mill Rate的高低直接影响纳税人的税负水平，因此其调整往往受到公众关注。

It is a critical factor in determining the amount of tax a property owner must pay and is typically set by local governments based on budget requirements and property assessments.
