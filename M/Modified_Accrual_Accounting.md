## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  修正权责发生制会计起源于20世纪80年代的美国，由美国政府会计准则委员会（GASB）提出并推广。当时，美国政府面临财政管理混乱的问题，急需一种既能反映实际财务状况又能简化操作的会计方法。经过多次讨论和实践，GASB最终确定了这一方法并纳入政府会计准则体系。  
  Modified Accrual Accounting originated in the United States in the 1980s, proposed and promoted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). At that time, the U.S. government faced chaotic fiscal management issues and urgently needed an accounting method that could reflect actual financial conditions while simplifying operations. After multiple discussions and practices, GASB finalized this method and incorporated it into government accounting standards.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，修正权责发生制会计的引入推动了地方政府财务管理体系的改革。它不仅提高了财政数据的准确性，还增强了公众对政府财政状况的信任感。目前，这一方法已在中国多个省市试点并逐步推广至全国范围。在全球范围内，许多国家也借鉴了这一方法以改善其公共部门财务管理水平。  
  In China, the introduction of Modified Accrual Accounting has driven reforms in local government financial management systems. It not only improves the accuracy of fiscal data but also enhances public trust in government financial conditions. Currently, this method has been piloted in multiple provinces and cities across China and is gradually being promoted nationwide. Globally, many countries have also adopted this approach to improve their public sector financial management.
