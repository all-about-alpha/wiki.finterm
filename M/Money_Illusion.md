# Money Illusion

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 货币幻觉（Money Illusion）是指人们在评估经济状况或做出财务决策时，只关注名义货币价值而忽略实际购买力变化的现象。这一概念由经济学家欧文·费雪（Irving Fisher）在20世纪初提出，核心在于人们往往被名义金额所迷惑，而忽视了通货膨胀或通货紧缩对实际价值的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Money Illusion refers to the tendency of individuals to focus on nominal monetary values while ignoring changes in real purchasing power when evaluating economic conditions or making financial decisions. This concept was introduced by economist Irving Fisher in the early 20th century, emphasizing that people are often misled by nominal amounts and overlook the impact of inflation or deflation on real value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 货币幻觉在日常生活和投资决策中广泛存在。例如，员工可能因名义工资上涨而感到满意，但若物价上涨更快，实际收入反而下降。投资者也可能因资产名义价值的增长而忽视通货膨胀对其实际收益的侵蚀。风险在于，这种幻觉可能导致错误的消费、储蓄和投资行为。  
  **English Explanation**: Money Illusion is prevalent in daily life and investment decisions. For instance, employees may feel satisfied with a nominal wage increase, but if prices rise faster, their real income actually decreases. Investors might also focus on the nominal growth of assets while ignoring the erosion of real returns due to inflation. The risk lies in the potential for misguided consumption, saving, and investment behaviors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管、投资和行业角度来看，理解货币幻觉至关重要。监管机构需通过政策引导公众关注实际经济指标；投资者应避免被名义收益迷惑，注重实际回报；企业则需在定价和薪酬策略中考虑通货膨胀因素，以维护长期竞争力。  
  **English Explanation**: Understanding Money Illusion is crucial from regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives. Regulators need to guide the public to focus on real economic indicators through policies; investors should avoid being misled by nominal returns and prioritize real gains; businesses must consider inflation in pricing and compensation strategies to maintain long-term competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: 货币幻觉的概念最早由美国经济学家欧文·费雪在其1928年的著作《货币幻觉》（The Money Illusion）中系统阐述。费雪通过研究通货膨胀对经济行为的影响，揭示了人们在面对价格变动时的认知偏差。这一理论为后来的行为经济学奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Money Illusion was first systematically articulated by American economist Irving Fisher in his 1928 book *The Money Illusion*. Through his research on the impact of inflation on economic behavior, Fisher revealed cognitive biases in people’s responses to price changes. This theory laid the groundwork for later developments in behavioral economics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: 货币幻觉对经济学和行为金融学产生了深远影响。它帮助解释了为什么人们在通货膨胀期间仍倾向于以名义价值衡量财富，以及为何政策制定者需要关注公众的实际经济感知。如今，这一概念在全球范围内的货币政策设计和消费者行为研究中仍具有重要参考价值。  
  **English Explanation**: Money Illusion has had a profound impact on economics and behavioral finance. It helps explain why people tend to measure wealth in nominal terms during inflation and why policymakers need to focus on the public’s perception of real economic conditions. Today, this concept remains a valuable reference in global monetary policy design and consumer behavior research.
