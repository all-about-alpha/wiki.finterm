# Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **边际收益产品（MRP）** 是指在其他生产要素不变的情况下，增加一单位某种生产要素所带来的额外收益。它由边际产量（MP）和边际收益（MR）共同决定，公式为 MRP = MP × MR。这一概念由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）在19世纪末提出，是微观经济学中分析生产要素需求的重要工具。  
  **Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)** refers to the additional revenue generated by employing one more unit of a factor of production, holding all other factors constant. It is determined by the product of Marginal Product (MP) and Marginal Revenue (MR), expressed as MRP = MP × MR. This concept was introduced by economist Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century and is a key tool in microeconomics for analyzing the demand for factors of production.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在企业决策中，MRP用于确定最优的要素投入量。例如，企业会根据劳动力的MRP来决定雇佣人数，以确保边际成本不超过边际收益。需要注意的是，如果市场不完全竞争或存在外部性，MRP的计算可能会受到影响。  
  In business decision-making, MRP is used to determine the optimal level of factor input. For instance, firms decide on the number of employees to hire based on the MRP of labor, ensuring that marginal cost does not exceed marginal revenue. It is important to note that in imperfectly competitive markets or in the presence of externalities, the calculation of MRP may be affected.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从投资和行业角度来看，MRP帮助企业优化资源配置，提高生产效率。在监管层面，理解MRP有助于制定合理的劳动政策和税收制度。对于投资者而言，分析企业的MRP可以评估其盈利能力和增长潜力。  
  From an investment and industry perspective, MRP helps firms optimize resource allocation and improve production efficiency. At the regulatory level, understanding MRP aids in formulating sound labor policies and tax systems. For investors, analyzing a firm’s MRP can assess its profitability and growth potential.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  边际收益产品的概念起源于19世纪末的新古典经济学派，由阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔在其著作《经济学原理》中首次系统阐述。马歇尔将边际分析方法引入生产要素市场的研究中，为现代微观经济学奠定了基础。  
  The concept of Marginal Revenue Product originated in the late 19th century with the neoclassical school of economics and was first systematically articulated by Alfred Marshall in his seminal work *Principles of Economics*. Marshall introduced marginal analysis into the study of factor markets, laying the foundation for modern microeconomics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  自提出以来，MRP理论在全球范围内被广泛应用于企业管理和政策制定中。它不仅推动了生产效率的提升，还为劳动经济学和资本市场的理论研究提供了重要支持。如今，MRP仍然是企业决策和经济分析的核心工具之一。  
  Since its introduction, MRP theory has been widely applied globally in business management and policy formulation. It has not only driven improvements in production efficiency but also provided significant support for theoretical research in labor economics and capital markets. Today, MRP remains one of the core tools for business decision-making and economic analysis.
