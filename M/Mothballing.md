# Mothballing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Mothballing（封存）是指将设备、工厂或项目暂时停止使用或运营，但保持其完好状态以便未来重新启用的过程。这一术语源自于将衣物放入樟脑丸（mothballs）以防止虫蛀的做法，引申为对资产进行保护性停用。  
  **English Explanation**: Mothballing refers to the process of temporarily shutting down equipment, factories, or projects while maintaining them in good condition for potential future reactivation. The term originates from the practice of storing clothes with mothballs to prevent moth damage, extended here to the protective shutdown of assets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Mothballing常用于制造业、能源行业和矿业等领域。例如，在市场需求低迷时，企业可能选择封存部分生产线以降低成本；或在资源价格下跌时，矿业公司可能封存矿山等待市场回暖。需要注意的是，封存期间仍需投入一定资金进行维护，且重新启动可能面临技术或市场风险。  
  **English Application**: Mothballing is commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, energy, and mining. For instance, during periods of low market demand, companies may mothball production lines to reduce costs; or in the case of falling resource prices, mining companies may mothball mines until market conditions improve. It is important to note that maintenance costs are still incurred during mothballing, and reactivation may face technical or market risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，Mothballing有助于企业在经济波动中保持灵活性；从投资角度看，它可以帮助企业减少亏损并保留资产价值；从行业角度看，它是应对市场不确定性的重要策略之一。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, mothballing helps companies maintain flexibility during economic fluctuations; from an investment perspective, it can reduce losses and preserve asset value; from an industry perspective, it is a key strategy for dealing with market uncertainties.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：Mothballing的概念最早可追溯到二战时期，当时许多军事设施和工厂在战争结束后被封存以备未来之需。20世纪70年代石油危机期间，这一策略被广泛应用于能源行业。如今，它已成为全球多个行业的通用做法。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of mothballing dates back to World War II when many military facilities and factories were shut down after the war for potential future use. During the oil crisis of the 1970s, this strategy was widely adopted in the energy industry. Today, it has become a common practice across multiple global industries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：Mothballing对行业的影响主要体现在帮助企业应对周期性波动和资源价格变化。例如，在石油价格暴跌时，许多油田被封存以减少亏损；而在需求回升时，这些油田可以迅速恢复生产。目前，这一策略在矿业、制造业和能源行业中仍被广泛使用。  
  **English Impact**: Mothballing has significantly impacted industries by helping companies navigate cyclical fluctuations and resource price changes. For example, during oil price crashes, many oil fields are mothballed to minimize losses; when demand rebounds, these fields can quickly resume production. Currently, this strategy remains widely used in mining, manufacturing, and energy industries.
