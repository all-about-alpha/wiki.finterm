# Market Segmentation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **市场细分** 是由美国营销学家温德尔·史密斯（Wendell Smith）于1956年提出的概念，指企业根据消费者的需求、行为、特征等将整体市场划分为若干具有相似需求的子市场的过程。核心概念包括目标市场选择、差异化营销和精准定位。  
  **Market Segmentation** is a concept introduced by American marketing scholar Wendell Smith in 1956, referring to the process by which businesses divide the overall market into smaller groups of consumers with similar needs, behaviors, or characteristics. Key concepts include target market selection, differentiated marketing, and precise positioning.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在市场细分中，企业通过地理、人口统计、心理和行为等因素划分市场，从而制定针对性的营销策略。例如，奢侈品品牌会针对高收入群体进行精准营销，而快消品则可能根据不同地区的消费习惯调整产品组合。需要注意的是，过度细分可能导致资源分散和市场定位模糊。  
  In market segmentation, businesses divide the market based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral factors to develop targeted marketing strategies. For example, luxury brands focus on high-income groups, while fast-moving consumer goods may adjust product portfolios based on regional consumption habits. However, excessive segmentation can lead to resource dispersion and unclear market positioning.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，市场细分有助于企业合规经营；从投资角度看，它帮助企业优化资源配置；从行业角度看，它推动市场竞争和创新。例如，互联网行业通过用户画像实现精准广告投放，提升转化率。  
  From a regulatory perspective, market segmentation helps businesses operate compliantly; from an investment perspective, it optimizes resource allocation; from an industry perspective, it drives competition and innovation. For instance, the internet industry uses user profiling for precise ad targeting to improve conversion rates.
