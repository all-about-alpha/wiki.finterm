## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 抵押贷款（Mortgage）是一种以不动产（如房屋或土地）作为抵押物的贷款形式。借款人将房产作为担保，向贷款机构（如银行）借款，并承诺按期偿还本金和利息。如果借款人未能按时还款，贷款机构有权依法处置抵押物以弥补损失。  
  **English Explanation**: A mortgage is a type of loan secured by real estate (such as a house or land). The borrower pledges the property as collateral to the lender (e.g., a bank) and agrees to repay the principal and interest over time. If the borrower fails to make payments, the lender has the legal right to seize and sell the property to recover the debt.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 抵押贷款广泛应用于个人购房、企业融资以及房地产投资等领域。在中国，购房者通常通过按揭贷款购买住房，而企业则可能利用商业地产进行抵押融资。需要注意的是，借款人需评估自身还款能力，避免因违约导致房产被收回的风险。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Mortgages are widely used for personal home purchases, business financing, and real estate investments. In China, homebuyers typically use mortgage loans to purchase properties, while businesses may leverage commercial real estate for financing. Borrowers must assess their repayment capacity to avoid default risks, which could lead to property foreclosure.
