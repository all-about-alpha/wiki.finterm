# Married Put

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Married Put（配对看跌期权）是一种投资策略，投资者在购买股票的同时，购买相应数量的看跌期权（Put Option）。这种策略的核心目的是为持有的股票提供下行保护，即当股票价格下跌时，看跌期权的收益可以抵消股票的损失。该策略由期权交易市场发展而来，结合了股票投资和期权交易的双重特性。  
  **English Explanation**: A Married Put is an investment strategy where an investor purchases a stock and simultaneously buys a corresponding number of put options. The core purpose of this strategy is to provide downside protection for the held stock, meaning that if the stock price falls, the gains from the put option can offset the losses from the stock. This strategy originated from the options trading market and combines the dual characteristics of stock investment and options trading.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：Married Put常用于投资者对某只股票长期看好但担心短期市场波动的情况。例如，当投资者持有某科技股并预期其长期上涨，但担忧近期市场调整时，可以通过购买看跌期权来对冲风险。需要注意的是，购买看跌期权需要支付权利金（Premium），这会增加投资成本。此外，如果股价上涨而非下跌，看跌期权将失效，权利金将成为沉没成本。  
  **English Explanation**: Married Put is often used when investors are bullish on a stock in the long term but concerned about short-term market volatility. For example, if an investor holds a tech stock and expects it to rise in the long term but worries about recent market adjustments, they can hedge risks by purchasing put options. It’s important to note that buying put options requires paying a premium, which increases investment costs. Additionally, if the stock price rises instead of falls, the put option will expire worthless, and the premium becomes a sunk cost.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，Married Put作为一种风险管理工具，有助于稳定市场情绪；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了灵活的风险对冲方式；从行业角度看，它促进了期权市场的流动性和发展。在中国资本市场逐步开放和衍生品市场日益成熟的背景下，Married Put等策略的应用将更加广泛。

Against the backdrop of China’s gradual capital market liberalization and increasing maturity of derivative markets, strategies like Married Put will see broader applications.
