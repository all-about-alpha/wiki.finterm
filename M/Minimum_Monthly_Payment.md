# Minimum Monthly Payment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 最低月还款额是指信用卡或贷款持有人在每月必须偿还的最低金额，通常由发卡机构或贷款方根据未偿还余额、利率和合同条款计算得出。这一金额旨在确保借款人能够逐步减少债务，同时避免违约。  
  **English Explanation**: The minimum monthly payment is the lowest amount a credit card or loan holder must repay each month, typically calculated by the card issuer or lender based on the outstanding balance, interest rate, and contractual terms. This amount ensures that borrowers can gradually reduce their debt while avoiding default.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 最低月还款额广泛应用于信用卡和分期贷款中。对于持卡人而言，支付最低还款额可以避免逾期罚款和信用记录受损，但长期仅支付最低金额会导致利息累积，增加还款压力。金融机构则通过这一机制降低坏账风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The minimum monthly payment is widely used in credit cards and installment loans. For cardholders, paying the minimum amount helps avoid late fees and credit score damage, but consistently paying only the minimum can lead to interest accumulation and increased repayment pressure. Financial institutions use this mechanism to reduce bad debt risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，最低月还款额是保护消费者权益的重要措施，防止过度负债；从投资和行业角度看，它是金融机构风险管理的关键工具，有助于维持信贷市场的稳定。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the minimum monthly payment is a crucial measure to protect consumer rights and prevent over-indebtedness. From an investment and industry standpoint, it is a key tool for financial institutions' risk management, helping maintain stability in the credit market.

  **English Explanation**: The introduction of the minimum monthly payment significantly reduced bad debt rates for financial institutions while promoting consumer credit growth.
