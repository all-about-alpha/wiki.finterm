  **English Explanation**: Maintenance Expenses refer to the ongoing costs incurred by businesses or individuals to keep assets or equipment in proper working condition. These expenses typically include routine repairs, upkeep, and replacement of parts to ensure the longevity and efficiency of the assets. The core concept of maintenance expenses lies in their preventive and continuous nature, aimed at avoiding larger losses due to lack of maintenance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：维护费用广泛应用于制造业、房地产、交通运输等行业。例如，工厂需要定期维护机器设备，以确保生产线的正常运行；物业管理公司需要支付建筑物的日常维护费用，如电梯保养、管道维修等。需要注意的是，维护费用应与资本性支出区分开，后者通常用于资产的新增或重大改造。  
  **English Explanation**: Maintenance expenses are widely applied in industries such as manufacturing, real estate, and transportation. For example, factories need to regularly maintain machinery to ensure the smooth operation of production lines; property management companies need to pay for routine building maintenance, such as elevator servicing and plumbing repairs. It is important to note that maintenance expenses should be distinguished from capital expenditures, which are typically used for asset acquisition or major renovations.

  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，维护费用的合理计提和支出是企业财务健康的重要指标；从投资角度看，高额的维护费用可能意味着资产老化或管理不善，影响企业估值；从行业角度看，维护费用的优化管理有助于提高资产利用率和降低运营成本。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the reasonable allocation and expenditure of maintenance expenses are key indicators of a company's financial health. From an investment perspective, high maintenance costs may indicate asset aging or poor management, affecting company valuation. From an industry perspective, optimized management of maintenance expenses helps improve asset utilization and reduce operational costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：维护费用的概念最早可追溯到工业革命时期，随着机械化生产的普及，工厂主开始意识到定期维护设备的重要性。20世纪初，科学管理理论的提出进一步推动了维护费用的系统化管理，例如泰勒制（Taylorism）强调通过标准化操作提高效率。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of maintenance expenses dates back to the Industrial Revolution, when factory owners began to recognize the importance of regular equipment maintenance with the rise of mechanized production. In the early 20th century, the development of scientific management theories, such as Taylorism, further promoted the systematic management of maintenance expenses by emphasizing efficiency through standardized operations.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：维护费用的管理对现代工业发展产生了深远影响。例如，日本在20世纪70年代提出的“全面生产维护”（TPM）理念，将维护费用管理提升到战略高度，显著提高了制造业的竞争力。如今，随着物联网和人工智能技术的应用，维护费用管理正朝着智能化和预测性方向发展。  
  **English Explanation**: The management of maintenance expenses has had a profound impact on modern industrial development. For example, Japan's "Total Productive Maintenance" (TPM) concept in the 1970s elevated maintenance expense management to a strategic level, significantly enhancing the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. Today, with the application of IoT and AI technologies, maintenance expense management is moving towards intelligence and predictive capabilities.
