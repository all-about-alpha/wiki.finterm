# Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    抵押贷款服务权（Mortgage Servicing Rights, MSR）是指贷款机构或第三方服务商在发放抵押贷款后，获得的对该贷款进行管理和服务的权利。这包括收取还款、管理账户、处理违约和提供客户服务等职责。MSR通常由贷款发起人（如银行或抵押贷款公司）出售给专门的抵押贷款服务商，以转移服务责任并获得一次性收入。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) refer to the rights acquired by a lender or a third-party servicer to manage and service a mortgage loan after its origination. This includes responsibilities such as collecting payments, managing accounts, handling defaults, and providing customer service. MSRs are often sold by loan originators (e.g., banks or mortgage companies) to specialized mortgage servicers to transfer servicing responsibilities and receive a lump-sum payment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    MSR广泛应用于抵押贷款市场，特别是在贷款发起人希望释放资本或减少管理负担时。服务商通过收取服务费（通常为贷款余额的一定比例）来盈利。然而，MSR的价值受利率变动、提前还款风险和违约风险等因素影响，因此服务商需要具备强大的风险管理能力。  
  - **English Application**  
    MSRs are widely used in the mortgage market, particularly when loan originators seek to free up capital or reduce administrative burdens. Servicers profit by charging servicing fees, typically a percentage of the loan balance. However, the value of MSRs is influenced by factors such as interest rate fluctuations, prepayment risks, and default risks, necessitating robust risk management capabilities.

  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, MSRs are a critical component of the mortgage market, enhancing liquidity and efficiency. From an investment standpoint, MSRs are considered an asset class with stable cash flows and potential high returns.
