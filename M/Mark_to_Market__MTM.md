## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  市值计价（Mark to Market，简称MTM）是一种会计和金融估值方法，指根据当前市场价格对资产或负债进行重新估值，以反映其真实市场价值。该方法广泛应用于金融衍生品、证券投资组合和资产负债表的估值中。核心概念是“以市定价”，确保资产和负债的账面价值与其市场价值一致。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Mark to Market (MTM) is an accounting and financial valuation method that involves revaluing assets or liabilities based on their current market prices to reflect their true market value. This method is widely used in the valuation of financial derivatives, investment portfolios, and balance sheets. The core concept is "pricing to market," ensuring that the book value of assets and liabilities aligns with their market value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景与风险提示**：  
  市值计价常用于期货、期权等金融衍生品的每日结算，以及投资组合的定期估值。在金融市场波动较大时，市值计价可能导致资产价值的剧烈波动，进而影响企业的财务状况和投资者的决策。此外，市值计价可能加剧市场恐慌，尤其是在金融危机期间。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  MTM is commonly used in the daily settlement of financial derivatives such as futures and options, as well as in the periodic valuation of investment portfolios. During periods of high market volatility, MTM can lead to significant fluctuations in asset values, impacting a company's financial health and investor decisions. Additionally, MTM can exacerbate market panic, particularly during financial crises.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，市值计价有助于提高财务透明度，防止企业通过虚报资产价值掩盖风险。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更准确的市场信息，有助于做出理性决策。从行业角度看，市值计价是金融市场标准化和国际化的重要工具。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, MTM enhances financial transparency by preventing companies from overstating asset values to hide risks. From an investment standpoint, it provides investors with more accurate market information for informed decision-making. From an industry perspective, MTM is a crucial tool for standardizing and globalizing financial markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文历史背景**：  
  市值计价的起源可以追溯到19世纪的商品交易市场，当时交易商开始使用市场价格来评估库存价值。20世纪80年代后，随着金融衍生品的兴起和国际会计准则的推广，市值计价逐渐成为主流的估值方法。2008年全球金融危机期间，市值计价的争议性进一步凸显。  
  **English Historical Background**：  
  The origins of MTM can be traced back to the commodity trading markets of the 19th century when traders began using market prices to assess inventory value. After the 1980s, with the rise of financial derivatives and the adoption of international accounting standards, MTM gradually became a mainstream valuation method. Its controversial nature was further highlighted during the global financial crisis of 2008.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文行业影响与现状**：  
  市值计价的广泛应用推动了金融市场的透明化和规范化，但也因其在危机中的放大效应而受到批评。目前，许多国家和国际组织正在探索改进市值计价的方法，以平衡其优点与潜在风险。例如，《国际财务报告准则》（IFRS）和美国《公认会计原则》（GAAP）均对市值计价的适用范围进行了调整和完善。  
  **English Impact Description**：  
  The widespread use of MTM has promoted transparency and standardization in financial markets but has also been criticized for its amplifying effects during crises. Currently, many countries and international organizations are exploring ways to improve MTM methods to balance its benefits with potential risks. For example, both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) have adjusted and refined the scope of MTM applications.
