## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 微型金融（Microfinance）是指为低收入群体或小微企业提供小额贷款、储蓄、保险和其他金融服务的金融活动。其核心理念是通过金融服务帮助贫困人群改善生活条件，促进经济发展。这一概念最早由孟加拉国的经济学家穆罕默德·尤努斯（Muhammad Yunus）提出，他创办的格莱珉银行（Grameen Bank）是微型金融的典范。  
  **English Explanation**: Microfinance refers to the provision of small loans, savings, insurance, and other financial services to low-income individuals or micro-enterprises. Its core concept is to help impoverished populations improve their living conditions and promote economic development through financial services. This concept was first introduced by Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus, whose Grameen Bank is a model of microfinance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 微型金融广泛应用于发展中国家和农村地区，特别是为缺乏传统银行服务的人群提供支持。例如，农民可以通过小额贷款购买种子和农具，女性创业者可以获得启动资金开展小生意。然而，微型金融也面临高违约率、运营成本高等风险，需谨慎管理。  
  **English Explanation**: Microfinance is widely used in developing countries and rural areas, particularly to support populations lacking access to traditional banking services. For example, farmers can use small loans to purchase seeds and tools, while female entrepreneurs can obtain startup capital for small businesses. However, microfinance also faces risks such as high default rates and operational costs, requiring careful management.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，微型金融有助于减少贫困和不平等；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了社会责任投资的机会；从行业角度看，它推动了普惠金融的发展。微型金融不仅是经济工具，更是社会变革的催化剂。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, microfinance helps reduce poverty and inequality; from an investment perspective, it offers opportunities for socially responsible investing; from an industry perspective, it promotes the development of inclusive finance. Microfinance is not just an economic tool but also a catalyst for social change.
