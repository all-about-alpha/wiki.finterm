# Market Value Added (MVA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：市场增加值（MVA）是衡量公司为股东创造价值的能力的指标，计算方式为公司的市场价值减去其投入的资本总额。它反映了公司在资本市场上的表现与其实际投入资本之间的差异。这一概念由美国经济学家斯特恩·斯图尔特（Stern Stewart）提出，核心在于评估公司是否通过经营活动和投资决策为股东带来了超额回报。  
  **English Explanation**: Market Value Added (MVA) is a metric that measures a company's ability to create value for its shareholders, calculated as the company's market value minus its total invested capital. It reflects the difference between a company's performance in the capital market and its actual invested capital. This concept was introduced by American economist Stern Stewart, with the core idea being to assess whether a company has generated excess returns for shareholders through its operations and investment decisions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：MVA常用于企业绩效评估、投资决策和并购分析中。例如，投资者可以通过比较不同公司的MVA来判断哪家公司更具投资价值。此外，企业管理层也可以利用MVA来优化资源配置，提升股东回报。需要注意的是，MVA受市场波动影响较大，因此在短期内的变化可能无法准确反映公司长期价值创造能力。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: MVA is commonly used in corporate performance evaluation, investment decision-making, and merger and acquisition analysis. For instance, investors can compare the MVA of different companies to determine which one offers better investment potential. Additionally, corporate management can use MVA to optimize resource allocation and enhance shareholder returns. It is important to note that MVA is highly sensitive to market fluctuations, so short-term changes may not accurately reflect a company's long-term value creation capabilities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，MVA有助于评估企业的市场表现是否符合其资本投入；从投资角度看，它是衡量公司是否为股东创造超额回报的重要指标；从行业角度看，高MVA的企业通常被视为行业领导者或创新者。因此，MVA在资本市场和企业管理中具有重要地位。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, MVA helps assess whether a company's market performance aligns with its capital investment; from an investment perspective, it is a key metric for determining whether a company generates excess returns for shareholders; from an industry perspective, companies with high MVA are often seen as industry leaders or innovators. Thus, MVA holds significant importance in both capital markets and corporate management.
