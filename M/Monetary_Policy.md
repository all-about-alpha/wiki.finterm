## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  货币政策是指中央银行通过控制货币供应量和利率等手段，以实现经济稳定、促进就业和控制通货膨胀等宏观经济目标的政策工具。其核心概念包括货币供应量、利率、公开市场操作、存款准备金率等。  
  Monetary policy refers to the tools used by a central bank to control the money supply and interest rates, aiming to achieve economic stability, promote employment, and control inflation. Core concepts include money supply, interest rates, open market operations, and reserve requirements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，货币政策由中国人民银行制定和执行，常见手段包括调整基准利率、存款准备金率以及公开市场操作。例如，在经济过热时，央行可能提高利率以抑制通胀；在经济低迷时，则可能降低利率以刺激经济增长。需要注意的是，货币政策的效果存在滞后性，且可能受到外部经济环境的影响。  
  In China, monetary policy is formulated and implemented by the People's Bank of China. Common tools include adjusting benchmark interest rates, reserve requirements, and open market operations. For example, during economic overheating, the central bank may raise interest rates to curb inflation; during economic downturns, it may lower rates to stimulate growth. It is important to note that the effects of monetary policy are often delayed and can be influenced by external economic conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，货币政策是宏观经济调控的重要手段之一；从投资角度看，货币政策的变化直接影响资本市场和资产价格；从行业角度看，货币政策的松紧程度会影响企业的融资成本和经营环境。因此，理解货币政策对投资者、企业和政策制定者都至关重要。  
  From a regulatory perspective, monetary policy is a key tool for macroeconomic management; from an investment perspective, changes in monetary policy directly impact capital markets and asset prices; from an industry perspective, the tightness or looseness of monetary policy affects corporate financing costs and operating environments. Thus, understanding monetary policy is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  现代货币政策的雏形可以追溯到20世纪初的西方国家。1929年大萧条后，凯恩斯主义经济学兴起，强调政府通过财政和货币政策干预经济的重要性。中国在改革开放后逐步引入现代货币政策框架，1995年《中国人民银行法》的颁布标志着中国货币政策的正式制度化。  
  The origins of modern monetary policy can be traced back to Western countries in the early 20th century. After the Great Depression of 1929, Keynesian economics emerged, emphasizing the importance of government intervention in the economy through fiscal and monetary policies. China gradually introduced a modern monetary policy framework after its reform and opening-up period. The enactment of the People's Bank of China Law in 1995 marked the formal institutionalization of China's monetary policy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  货币政策在全球范围内对经济发展产生了深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机后，各国央行普遍采取宽松货币政策以刺激经济复苏。在中国，货币政策的调整对房地产、制造业和金融市场等行业产生了显著影响。当前，随着全球经济不确定性增加，货币政策的灵活性和精准性变得尤为重要。  
  Monetary policy has had a profound impact on global economic development. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, central banks worldwide adopted accommodative monetary policies to stimulate recovery. In China, adjustments in monetary policy have significantly impacted industries such as real estate, manufacturing, and financial markets. Currently, with increasing global economic uncertainty, the flexibility and precision of monetary policy have become particularly important.
