  **Market Neutral** is an investment strategy designed to hedge market risk by simultaneously holding long and short positions, thereby generating returns that are independent of overall market movements. The core concept lies in precise asset allocation and risk management to eliminate systemic market risk, focusing on capturing relative value differences between individual stocks or assets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，市场中性策略常用于对冲基金和量化投资领域。投资者通过构建多空组合，利用统计套利、配对交易等方法，在A股、港股等市场中寻找定价偏差的机会。需要注意的是，该策略对模型精度和交易成本要求较高，且可能面临流动性风险和模型失效的风险。

Investors construct long-short portfolios using methods like statistical arbitrage and pairs trading to identify pricing discrepancies in markets such as A-shares and H-shares. It’s important to note that this strategy requires high model accuracy and incurs significant transaction costs, while also facing risks such as liquidity risk and model failure.
