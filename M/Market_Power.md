# Market Power

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **市场力量** 是指企业或组织在市场中通过控制价格、产量或其他关键因素，影响市场供需关系的能力。这一概念最早由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）提出，核心在于企业在竞争环境中占据主导地位的能力。  
  **Market Power** refers to the ability of a firm or organization to influence the supply and demand dynamics in a market by controlling prices, output, or other key factors. This concept was first introduced by economist Alfred Marshall and centers on a firm's dominance in a competitive environment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在市场力量的应用中，企业可能通过垄断或寡头垄断形式限制竞争，从而获取超额利润。例如，中国电信行业曾因市场力量集中而引发反垄断调查。需要注意的是，滥用市场力量可能导致资源配置效率低下和消费者福利受损。  
  In practice, firms may use market power to restrict competition through monopolies or oligopolies, thereby earning excess profits. For instance, China's telecommunications industry has faced antitrust investigations due to concentrated market power. It is important to note that the abuse of market power can lead to inefficient resource allocation and reduced consumer welfare.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，市场力量的滥用可能破坏市场竞争秩序，因此反垄断法规成为重要工具。从投资角度，拥有强大市场力量的企业通常被视为更具投资价值。在行业层面，市场力量的合理运用有助于推动创新和效率提升。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the abuse of market power can disrupt market competition, making antitrust laws essential. From an investment standpoint, firms with significant market power are often seen as more valuable. At the industry level, the judicious use of market power can drive innovation and efficiency.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  市场力量的概念起源于19世纪末的经济学理论，特别是阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔的《经济学原理》。马歇尔通过分析企业行为与市场价格的关系，首次系统阐述了市场力量的理论框架。20世纪初，随着工业革命的深入，大型企业的崛起使得这一概念得到广泛应用。  
  The concept of market power originated in late 19th-century economic theory, particularly in Alfred Marshall's *Principles of Economics*. Marshall systematically articulated the theoretical framework of market power by analyzing the relationship between firm behavior and market prices. In the early 20th century, with the Industrial Revolution advancing, the rise of large corporations led to widespread application of this concept.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，市场力量的集中曾导致部分行业出现垄断现象，如能源和通信领域。近年来，中国政府通过反垄断法和市场监管措施逐步规范企业行为。在全球范围内，市场力量的滥用已成为跨国公司和各国监管机构关注的焦点。  
  In China, concentrated market power has led to monopolistic practices in industries such as energy and telecommunications. In recent years, the Chinese government has gradually regulated corporate behavior through antitrust laws and market supervision measures. Globally, the abuse of market power has become a focal point for multinational corporations and regulatory bodies.
