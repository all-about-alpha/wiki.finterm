# Momentum Investing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **动量投资**是一种投资策略，基于“强者恒强”的理念，认为过去表现良好的资产（如股票、基金等）在未来一段时间内仍会继续表现良好。该策略的核心是追踪资产的价格趋势和交易量变化，通过买入近期表现优异的资产并卖出表现不佳的资产来获取收益。  
  **Momentum Investing** is an investment strategy based on the idea that assets (such as stocks or funds) that have performed well in the past will continue to perform well in the near future. The core of this strategy is to track price trends and trading volume changes, buying assets with strong recent performance and selling those with weak performance to generate returns.

* **应用 / Application**  
  动量投资常用于股票市场，投资者通过技术分析工具（如移动平均线、相对强弱指数等）识别趋势并制定交易策略。然而，该策略存在一定风险，如市场反转或趋势突然中断可能导致损失。因此，投资者需结合风险管理工具（如止损单）以降低潜在风险。  
  Momentum investing is commonly used in stock markets, where investors use technical analysis tools (such as moving averages or relative strength index) to identify trends and develop trading strategies. However, this strategy carries risks, such as market reversals or sudden trend interruptions, which may lead to losses. Therefore, investors need to incorporate risk management tools (e.g., stop-loss orders) to mitigate potential risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  动量投资的概念最早可追溯到20世纪中期，由美国学者Jegadeesh和Titman于1993年在其论文《Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers》中系统提出。他们通过对美股市场的实证研究发现，过去3至12个月内表现优异的股票在未来3至12个月内仍会持续跑赢市场。这一发现为动量投资奠定了学术基础。  
  The concept of momentum investing dates back to the mid-20th century and was systematically proposed by American scholars Jegadeesh and Titman in their 1993 paper *Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers*. Through empirical research on the U.S. stock market, they found that stocks with strong performance over the past 3 to 12 months continued to outperform the market in the subsequent 3 to 12 months. This discovery laid the academic foundation for momentum investing.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  动量投资的提出对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。它不仅成为量化投资领域的重要策略之一，还推动了算法交易和高频交易的发展。如今，动量投资已被广泛应用于全球股市、外汇市场和商品市场，成为机构投资者和个人投资者的重要工具之一。然而，其依赖历史数据的特性也引发了关于市场有效性和行为金融学的广泛讨论。

It has become one of the key strategies in quantitative investing and has driven the development of algorithmic and high-frequency trading. Today, momentum investing is widely applied in global stock markets, forex markets, and commodity markets, serving as an important tool for both institutional and individual investors.
