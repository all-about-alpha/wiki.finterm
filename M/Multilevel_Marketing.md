# Multilevel Marketing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  多层次营销（Multilevel Marketing，简称MLM），又称网络营销或直销，是一种通过建立多层次的销售网络来推广和销售产品或服务的商业模式。参与者不仅通过销售产品获得佣金，还可以通过招募新的销售人员（下线）并从中获取一定比例的佣金。这种模式的核心在于“团队建设”和“层级收益”。多层次营销的创始概念可追溯到20世纪中叶，由美国公司如安利（Amway）等推广开来。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Multilevel Marketing (MLM), also known as network marketing or direct selling, is a business model that promotes and sells products or services through the establishment of a multi-tiered sales network. Participants earn commissions not only by selling products but also by recruiting new salespeople (downlines) and receiving a percentage of their sales. The core of this model lies in "team building" and "hierarchical earnings." The concept of MLM originated in the mid-20th century and was popularized by companies like Amway in the United States.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：  
  多层次营销广泛应用于健康产品、化妆品、家居用品等领域。在中国，多层次营销受到严格监管，因其容易与非法传销混淆。合法的多层次营销公司需获得政府批准，并遵守相关法律法规。参与者需注意风险，避免陷入以招募下线为主要盈利模式的非法传销活动。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Multilevel marketing is widely used in industries such as health products, cosmetics, and household goods. In China, MLM is strictly regulated due to its potential confusion with illegal pyramid schemes. Legitimate MLM companies must obtain government approval and comply with relevant laws and regulations. Participants should be aware of the risks and avoid illegal pyramid schemes that primarily focus on recruiting downlines for profit.

  **English Explanation**:  
  From a regulatory perspective, the legality of multilevel marketing is crucial for maintaining market order. From an investment perspective, it offers low-barrier entrepreneurial opportunities but also carries high risks. From an industry perspective, MLM has driven the development of the direct selling industry but has also sparked widespread debate over its ethical and legal compliance.
