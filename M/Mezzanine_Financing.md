# Mezzanine Financing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：夹层融资（Mezzanine Financing）是一种介于股权融资和债权融资之间的混合融资方式。它通常以次级债务或可转换债券的形式出现，投资者在获得固定利息的同时，还可能通过股权转换权获得额外收益。夹层融资常用于企业扩张、并购或资本重组等场景，因其灵活性和高风险高回报特性而受到青睐。  
  **English Explanation**: Mezzanine financing is a hybrid form of financing that sits between equity and debt. It typically takes the form of subordinated debt or convertible bonds, where investors receive fixed interest payments and may also gain additional returns through equity conversion rights. This type of financing is often used for business expansion, mergers and acquisitions, or capital restructuring, valued for its flexibility and high-risk, high-reward nature.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：夹层融资广泛应用于企业扩张、杠杆收购（LBO）和资本重组等场景。由于其风险较高，通常适用于现金流稳定且增长潜力大的企业。投资者需注意其次级债务性质，即在企业破产时偿还顺序低于优先债务。此外，夹层融资的利率较高，可能增加企业的财务负担。  
  **English Explanation**: Mezzanine financing is widely used in scenarios such as business expansion, leveraged buyouts (LBOs), and capital restructuring. Due to its higher risk, it is typically suitable for companies with stable cash flow and significant growth potential. Investors should be aware of its subordinated nature, meaning it ranks below senior debt in the event of bankruptcy. Additionally, the higher interest rates associated with mezzanine financing can increase a company’s financial burden.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，夹层融资为企业提供了多样化的融资渠道，有助于优化资本结构；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了高收益机会；从行业角度看，夹层融资推动了并购和资本市场的活跃度。然而，其高风险特性也要求企业和投资者谨慎评估。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, mezzanine financing provides companies with diversified funding options, helping optimize capital structures; from an investment standpoint, it offers high-yield opportunities for investors; from an industry perspective, it drives activity in mergers and acquisitions as well as capital markets. However, its high-risk nature requires careful evaluation by both companies and investors.
