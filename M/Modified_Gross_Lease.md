# Modified Gross Lease

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 修正总租约（Modified Gross Lease）是一种介于全服务租约（Gross Lease）和净租约（Net Lease）之间的租赁形式。在这种租约中，房东和租户共同分担某些运营费用，如物业税、保险和维护费用。通常，房东负责支付建筑物的结构维护和公共区域的费用，而租户则承担其租赁空间内的运营成本。  
  **English Explanation**: A Modified Gross Lease is a hybrid leasing arrangement that falls between a Gross Lease and a Net Lease. In this type of lease, both the landlord and the tenant share certain operating expenses, such as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Typically, the landlord is responsible for structural maintenance and common area expenses, while the tenant covers the operational costs within their leased space.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 修正总租约常见于商业地产租赁，尤其是办公空间和零售物业。这种租约形式为双方提供了灵活性，房东可以减轻部分运营负担，而租户则能更好地控制其内部成本。然而，双方需在合同中明确费用分担的具体条款，以避免未来纠纷。  
  **English Explanation**: Modified Gross Leases are commonly used in commercial real estate, particularly for office spaces and retail properties. This leasing arrangement offers flexibility to both parties: landlords can reduce some operational burdens, while tenants gain better control over their internal costs. However, it is crucial for both parties to clearly define the expense-sharing terms in the contract to avoid future disputes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 修正总租约在商业地产市场中具有重要意义，因为它平衡了房东和租户的利益。从监管角度看，这种租约形式有助于明确责任划分；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更稳定的现金流；从行业角度看，它促进了租赁市场的多样性和灵活性。  
  **English Explanation**: The Modified Gross Lease holds significant importance in the commercial real estate market as it balances the interests of landlords and tenants. From a regulatory perspective, this lease type helps clarify responsibility divisions; from an investment standpoint, it offers more stable cash flows; and from an industry perspective, it promotes diversity and flexibility in the leasing market.
