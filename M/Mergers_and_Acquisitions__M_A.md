  **中文解释**：现代意义上的并购起源于19世纪末的美国工业革命时期。当时，铁路、石油和钢铁等行业的企业通过大规模合并形成了垄断性企业集团，如标准石油公司和美国钢铁公司。20世纪80年代后，全球范围内的跨国并购逐渐兴起。  
  **English Explanation**: The modern concept of M&A originated during the late 19th-century Industrial Revolution in the United States. Companies in industries such as railroads, oil, and steel formed monopolistic conglomerates through large-scale mergers, such as Standard Oil and U.S. Steel.
