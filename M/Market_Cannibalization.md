# Market Cannibalization

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：市场蚕食（Market Cannibalization）是指企业推出新产品或服务时，导致现有产品或服务的市场份额减少的现象。这种现象通常发生在企业内部，当新产品与现有产品在目标市场或功能上存在重叠时，新产品的成功可能以牺牲现有产品的销售为代价。  
  **English Explanation**: Market Cannibalization refers to the phenomenon where the introduction of a new product or service by a company leads to a reduction in the market share of its existing products or services. This typically occurs internally within a company when the new product overlaps with the existing product in terms of target market or functionality, and the success of the new product may come at the expense of sales of the existing product.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：市场蚕食常见于科技、零售和消费品行业。例如，苹果公司推出新款iPhone时，可能会影响旧款iPhone的销量。企业在推出新产品时需谨慎评估其可能对现有产品线的影响，并制定相应的营销策略以最小化蚕食效应。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Market cannibalization is commonly seen in industries such as technology, retail, and consumer goods. For example, when Apple releases a new iPhone model, it may impact the sales of older iPhone models. Companies need to carefully assess the potential impact on their existing product lines when launching new products and develop marketing strategies to minimize cannibalization effects.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从投资和行业角度来看，市场蚕食是企业创新和市场竞争中的双刃剑。一方面，它表明企业正在积极创新以满足市场需求；另一方面，它可能导致短期利润下降和品牌价值稀释。监管机构也关注这一现象，因为它可能影响市场竞争格局。  
  **English Significance**: From an investment and industry perspective, market cannibalization is a double-edged sword in corporate innovation and market competition. On one hand, it indicates that companies are actively innovating to meet market demands; on the other hand, it may lead to short-term profit declines and brand value dilution. Regulatory bodies also pay attention to this phenomenon as it can impact market competition dynamics.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：市场蚕食的概念最早可追溯到20世纪中期的市场营销理论。随着企业多元化战略的兴起，学者们开始研究企业内部产品之间的竞争关系。1970年代，哈佛商学院的研究进一步明确了这一现象的定义和影响机制。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of market cannibalization can be traced back to mid-20th-century marketing theories. With the rise of corporate diversification strategies, scholars began studying competitive relationships between products within companies. In the 1970s, research from Harvard Business School further clarified the definition and mechanisms of this phenomenon.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：市场蚕食对行业的影响深远。在科技行业，快速的产品迭代使得企业必须不断推出新产品以保持竞争力，但这也加剧了内部竞争的风险。目前，许多企业通过差异化战略和创新管理来应对这一挑战。  
  **English Impact**: Market cannibalization has profound impacts on industries. In the technology sector, rapid product iterations force companies to continuously launch new products to maintain competitiveness, but this also increases internal competition risks.
