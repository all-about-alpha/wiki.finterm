# Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：制造商建议零售价（MSRP）是指制造商为其产品设定的推荐零售价格。这一价格通常由制造商根据生产成本、市场竞争状况和品牌定位等因素制定，旨在为零售商提供一个统一的定价参考。MSRP并非强制性的，零售商可以根据市场需求和竞争情况自行调整实际售价。  
  **English Explanation**: The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is the recommended retail price set by the manufacturer for its products. This price is typically determined based on factors such as production costs, market competition, and brand positioning, aiming to provide retailers with a unified pricing reference. The MSRP is not mandatory, and retailers can adjust the actual selling price based on market demand and competitive conditions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：MSRP广泛应用于汽车、电子产品、家用电器等行业。例如，在汽车销售中，MSRP通常作为新车的基础定价，消费者可以在此基础上与经销商协商最终价格。需要注意的是，MSRP并不包含税费、运费或其他附加费用，实际购车成本可能高于MSRP。  
  **English Application**: The MSRP is widely used in industries such as automobiles, electronics, and home appliances. For instance, in car sales, the MSRP often serves as the base price for new vehicles, and consumers can negotiate the final price with dealers based on this figure. It is important to note that the MSRP does not include taxes, shipping fees, or other additional costs, so the actual purchase price may be higher than the MSRP.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从行业角度来看，MSRP有助于维护品牌形象和市场秩序，避免价格战。对消费者而言，MSRP提供了一个透明的价格参考，便于比较不同品牌和产品的性价比。从投资角度，MSRP的稳定性可以反映制造商的定价策略和市场竞争力。
