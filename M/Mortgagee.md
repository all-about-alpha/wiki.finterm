# Mortgagee

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：抵押权人（Mortgagee）是指在抵押贷款中，提供资金并持有抵押物作为担保的一方。通常是银行、金融机构或其他贷款人。抵押权人在借款人未能按时还款时，有权依法处置抵押物以弥补损失。  
  **English Explanation**: The mortgagee is the party in a mortgage agreement who provides the funds and holds the collateral (usually property) as security. Typically, this is a bank, financial institution, or other lender. The mortgagee has the legal right to seize and sell the collateral if the borrower fails to repay the loan.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在房地产贷款中，银行作为抵押权人向购房者提供贷款，并以房产作为抵押。如果购房者违约，银行有权拍卖房产以收回贷款。风险在于市场波动可能导致抵押物价值不足以覆盖贷款余额。  
  **English Application**: In real estate loans, banks act as mortgagees by providing loans to homebuyers, with the property serving as collateral. If the borrower defaults, the bank can foreclose on and sell the property to recover the loan. Risks include market fluctuations that may reduce the collateral’s value below the outstanding loan amount.
