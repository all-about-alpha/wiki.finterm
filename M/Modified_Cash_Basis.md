# Modified Cash Basis

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：修正现金收付制（Modified Cash Basis）是一种介于现金收付制和权责发生制之间的会计方法。它结合了现金收付制的简单性和权责发生制的某些特点，通常用于记录短期现金流和长期资产或负债的权责发生。这种方法在非营利组织和政府机构中较为常见。  
  **English Explanation**: The Modified Cash Basis is an accounting method that lies between the cash basis and the accrual basis. It combines the simplicity of the cash basis with certain features of the accrual basis, typically used to record short-term cash flows and long-term assets or liabilities on an accrual basis. This method is commonly used in non-profit organizations and government agencies.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：修正现金收付制常用于非营利组织、政府机构以及小型企业，特别是在需要简化会计流程但又需反映长期财务状况的场合。然而，这种方法可能无法完全满足国际财务报告准则（IFRS）或美国通用会计准则（GAAP）的要求，因此在正式财务报表中需谨慎使用。  
  **English Explanation**: The Modified Cash Basis is often applied in non-profit organizations, government agencies, and small businesses, especially where simplified accounting processes are needed while still reflecting long-term financial conditions. However, this method may not fully comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), so it should be used cautiously in formal financial statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：修正现金收付制在简化会计流程的同时，提供了比纯现金收付制更全面的财务信息，特别适用于资源有限的组织。然而，由于其不完全符合国际会计准则，投资者和监管机构在评估财务报表时需特别注意其局限性。  
  **English Explanation**: The Modified Cash Basis simplifies accounting processes while providing more comprehensive financial information than the pure cash basis, making it particularly suitable for resource-limited organizations. However, since it does not fully comply with international accounting standards, investors and regulators need to pay special attention to its limitations when evaluating financial statements.
