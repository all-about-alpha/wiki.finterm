# Marginal Tax Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **边际税率**是指纳税人每增加一单位应税收入所适用的税率。它是累进税制中的一个核心概念，反映了收入增加部分所承担的税负比例。边际税率通常高于平均税率，因为随着收入的增加，适用的税率也会逐级提高。  
  The **Marginal Tax Rate** refers to the rate of tax applied to each additional unit of taxable income. It is a core concept in progressive tax systems, reflecting the proportion of tax burden on the incremental portion of income. The marginal tax rate is typically higher than the average tax rate, as the applicable rate increases with higher income brackets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，边际税率主要应用于个人所得税和企业所得税的计算中。例如，个人年收入超过一定门槛后，超出部分将适用更高的税率。企业在计算应纳税所得额时，也需要考虑边际税率的影响。需要注意的是，边际税率的变化可能会影响个人和企业的投资、消费和储蓄决策。  
  In China, the marginal tax rate is primarily applied in the calculation of individual income tax and corporate income tax. For instance, when an individual's annual income exceeds a certain threshold, the excess portion is subject to a higher tax rate. Similarly, businesses must consider the impact of marginal tax rates when calculating taxable income. It is important to note that changes in marginal tax rates can influence personal and corporate decisions regarding investment, consumption, and savings.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，边际税率是调节收入分配、实现社会公平的重要工具。从投资和行业角度看，边际税率的高低直接影响企业和个人的税后收益，进而影响经济活动的积极性。高边际税率可能抑制投资和消费，而低边际税率则可能刺激经济增长。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the marginal tax rate is a crucial tool for adjusting income distribution and achieving social equity. From an investment and industry standpoint, the level of the marginal tax rate directly affects the after-tax income of individuals and businesses, thereby influencing economic activity. High marginal tax rates may discourage investment and consumption, while low marginal tax rates can stimulate economic growth.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  边际税率的概念最早可以追溯到19世纪末的德国经济学家阿道夫·瓦格纳（Adolf Wagner），他提出了累进税制的理论。20世纪初，随着各国税制的改革，边际税率逐渐成为现代税收体系的重要组成部分。中国在1980年引入个人所得税时，也开始采用累进税率制度，边际税率的概念随之被广泛应用。  
  The concept of the marginal tax rate can be traced back to the late 19th century, when German economist Adolf Wagner proposed the theory of progressive taxation. In the early 20th century, as tax systems were reformed globally, the marginal tax rate became an integral part of modern taxation. China adopted a progressive tax rate system when it introduced individual income tax in 1980, and the concept of marginal tax rate has since been widely applied.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  边际税率的引入对中国的税收制度产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了税收的公平性，还增强了政府对经济的调控能力。目前，中国的个人所得税和企业所得税均采用累进税率，边际税率的变化直接关系到纳税人的税负水平。在全球范围内，边际税率也是各国税收政策制定的重要参考指标。  
  The introduction of the marginal tax rate has had a profound impact on China's tax system. It has not only improved the fairness of taxation but also enhanced the government's ability to regulate the economy. Currently, both individual and corporate income taxes in China use progressive tax rates, and changes in marginal tax rates directly affect taxpayers' burden. Globally, the marginal tax rate is also a key reference for tax policy formulation in various countries.
