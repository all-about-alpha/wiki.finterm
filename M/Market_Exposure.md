  **English Explanation**: Market Exposure refers to the degree of risk that an investor or company faces in the financial market due to holding specific assets or engaging in particular transactions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：市场暴露广泛应用于投资组合管理、企业财务规划和风险管理中。例如，投资者通过分散投资降低单一资产的市场暴露，企业则通过套期保值减少汇率或商品价格波动的风险。需要注意的是，过高的市场暴露可能导致重大损失，尤其是在市场剧烈波动时。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Market Exposure is widely applied in portfolio management, corporate financial planning, and risk management. For instance, investors reduce exposure to a single asset by diversifying their portfolios, while companies mitigate risks from currency or commodity price fluctuations through hedging. It is important to note that excessive market exposure can lead to significant losses, especially during periods of high market volatility.
