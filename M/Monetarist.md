  **English Explanation**: A Monetarist is an economic school of thought that emphasizes the importance of the money supply as the primary factor influencing economic activity and inflation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：货币主义理论在货币政策制定中广泛应用，特别是在控制通货膨胀和稳定经济方面。例如，中央银行通过调节利率和公开市场操作来管理货币供应量。然而，过度依赖货币供应量调控可能忽视其他经济因素，如财政政策和市场预期。  
  **English Explanation**: Monetarist theory is widely applied in monetary policy formulation, particularly in controlling inflation and stabilizing the economy. For instance, central banks manage the money supply through interest rate adjustments and open market operations.

  **English Explanation**: Monetarism originated in the 1950s to 1960s, developed by Milton Friedman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago.
