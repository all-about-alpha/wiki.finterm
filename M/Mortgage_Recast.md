  **English Explanation**: Mortgage recast is a process where a borrower, after making a significant principal payment, requests the lender to recalculate the monthly payments for the remaining loan balance, thereby reducing the monthly financial burden.

  **English Application Scenarios**: Mortgage recast is suitable for borrowers who receive a lump sum of money (e.g., bonuses, inheritance, or investment returns) and wish to reduce their monthly payment obligations. It’s important to note that not all lenders offer this service, and additional fees may apply. Additionally, the loan term typically remains unchanged after recasting.
