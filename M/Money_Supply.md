# Money Supply

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 货币供应量（Money Supply）是指在一定时期内，一个国家或经济体中流通的货币总量。它包括现金、活期存款、定期存款以及其他可以迅速转化为现金的金融资产。货币供应量通常由中央银行监控和调控，是衡量经济活动和通货膨胀的重要指标。  
  **English Explanation**: Money Supply refers to the total amount of money available in an economy at a specific time. It includes cash, demand deposits, time deposits, and other financial assets that can be quickly converted into cash. The money supply is typically monitored and regulated by the central bank and serves as a crucial indicator of economic activity and inflation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 货币供应量的变化直接影响利率、通货膨胀和经济增长。中央银行通过调整货币政策（如公开市场操作、调整准备金率等）来调控货币供应量，以实现经济稳定。投资者和企业也会根据货币供应量的变化调整投资和经营策略。需要注意的是，过度的货币供应可能导致通货膨胀，而不足则可能引发经济衰退。  
  **English Explanation**: Changes in the money supply directly impact interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. Central banks regulate the money supply through monetary policies (such as open market operations and adjusting reserve requirements) to achieve economic stability. Investors and businesses also adjust their strategies based on changes in the money supply. It is important to note that excessive money supply can lead to inflation, while insufficient supply may cause economic recession.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，货币供应量是中央银行制定货币政策的重要依据；从投资角度看，它影响资产价格和市场预期；从行业角度看，企业需要根据货币供应量的变化调整生产和销售策略。因此，货币供应量是宏观经济管理中的核心指标之一。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the money supply is a key basis for central banks to formulate monetary policies; from an investment perspective, it influences asset prices and market expectations; from an industry perspective, businesses need to adjust production and sales strategies based on changes in the money supply. Therefore, the money supply is one of the core indicators in macroeconomic management.
