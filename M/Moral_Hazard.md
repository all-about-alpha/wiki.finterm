# Moral Hazard

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：道德风险（Moral Hazard）是指当一方在交易或协议中因无需承担全部后果而倾向于采取更高风险行为的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow）提出，核心在于信息不对称和激励机制的失衡。  
  **English Explanation**: Moral Hazard refers to the phenomenon where one party in a transaction or agreement is incentivized to take on higher risks because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions. This concept was first introduced by economist Kenneth Arrow, focusing on information asymmetry and misaligned incentives.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：道德风险常见于保险、金融和公司治理领域。例如，投保人可能因保险公司承担损失而忽视风险管理；银行可能因政府救助预期而从事高风险投资。需注意防范因道德风险导致的系统性风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Moral Hazard is prevalent in insurance, finance, and corporate governance. For instance, insured parties may neglect risk management because the insurer bears the loss; banks might engage in high-risk investments due to expectations of government bailouts. It is crucial to mitigate systemic risks arising from moral hazard.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，道德风险可能导致市场失灵，需通过政策设计（如资本要求、激励机制）加以约束；从投资角度看，识别道德风险有助于评估企业或金融机构的潜在风险；从行业角度看，道德风险是金融稳定和可持续发展的关键挑战。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, moral hazard can lead to market failures, necessitating policy measures like capital requirements and incentive alignment. For investors, identifying moral hazard helps assess potential risks in firms or financial institutions. For industries, it is a critical challenge to financial stability and sustainable development.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：道德风险的概念可追溯至17世纪的保险业，但现代经济学中的定义由肯尼斯·阿罗在20世纪60年代提出。阿罗在研究医疗保险时发现，投保人因无需承担全部医疗费用而可能过度使用医疗服务，从而提出了这一理论。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of moral hazard dates back to the 17th-century insurance industry, but its modern economic definition was formulated by Kenneth Arrow in the 1960s. While studying health insurance, Arrow observed that insured individuals might overuse medical services because they did not bear the full cost, leading to the development of this theory.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：道德风险对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机中，银行因预期政府救助而过度冒险，加剧了危机。如今，道德风险仍是金融监管和风险管理的重要议题。  
  **English Explanation**: Moral Hazard has profoundly impacted the global financial system. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, banks took excessive risks due to expectations of government bailouts, exacerbating the crisis.
