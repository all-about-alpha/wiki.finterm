# Married Filing Jointly

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：已婚联合申报（Married Filing Jointly）是指已婚夫妇选择将他们的收入和扣除项目合并在一起，共同向税务机关申报所得税的一种报税方式。这种方式通常适用于合法结婚的夫妇，旨在简化报税流程并可能享受更低的税率或更高的税收优惠。  
  **English Explanation**: Married Filing Jointly refers to a tax filing status where a married couple combines their income and deductions to file a single tax return with the tax authority. This status is typically available to legally married couples and aims to simplify the tax filing process while potentially offering lower tax rates or greater tax benefits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：已婚联合申报适用于合法结婚的夫妇，尤其是当一方收入较高或双方收入差距较大时。这种方式可以帮助夫妇减少整体税负，并享受更多的税收抵免和扣除。需要注意的是，选择联合申报后，双方对税务责任承担连带责任，需确保申报信息的准确性。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Married Filing Jointly is suitable for legally married couples, particularly when one spouse earns significantly more or there is a large income disparity between the two. This filing status can help reduce the couple's overall tax liability and allow them to claim more tax credits and deductions.
