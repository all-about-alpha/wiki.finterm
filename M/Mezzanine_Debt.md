# Mezzanine Debt

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：夹层债务（Mezzanine Debt）是一种介于优先债务和股权之间的混合融资工具，通常用于企业收购、资本重组或项目融资。它结合了债务和股权的特点，既提供固定利息支付，又可能附带股权认购权或转股权。夹层债务的优先级低于传统银行贷款，但高于普通股。  
  **English Explanation**: Mezzanine debt is a hybrid financing instrument that sits between senior debt and equity, commonly used in corporate acquisitions, recapitalizations, or project financing. It combines features of both debt and equity, offering fixed interest payments while potentially including equity warrants or conversion rights. Mezzanine debt is subordinate to traditional bank loans but senior to common equity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：夹层债务常用于杠杆收购（LBO）、企业扩张或资本密集型项目。由于其灵活性，它特别适合那些需要额外资金但又不愿稀释现有股东权益的企业。然而，夹层债务的利率较高，且可能伴随严格的条款，投资者需注意其潜在风险。  
  **English Application**: Mezzanine debt is frequently used in leveraged buyouts (LBOs), corporate expansions, or capital-intensive projects. Due to its flexibility, it is particularly suitable for companies needing additional funding without diluting existing shareholders' equity. However, mezzanine debt carries higher interest rates and may come with stringent terms, requiring investors to be cautious of its potential risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，夹层债务为企业提供了多样化的融资渠道；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了较高的回报潜力；从行业角度看，它推动了并购和资本市场的活跃度。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, mezzanine debt provides companies with diversified financing options; from an investment standpoint, it offers investors higher return potential; from an industry perspective, it drives the dynamism of mergers and acquisitions as well as capital markets.
