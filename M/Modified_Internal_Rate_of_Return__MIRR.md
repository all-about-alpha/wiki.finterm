# Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：修正内部收益率（MIRR）是内部收益率（IRR）的改进版本，由金融学家提出，用于解决传统IRR在多重现金流和再投资假设上的局限性。MIRR通过明确再投资率和融资成本，提供更准确的投资回报率评估。其核心概念包括：将现金流分为正负两部分，分别以再投资率和融资成本进行折现或复利计算，最终得出一个更合理的收益率。  
  **English Explanation**: The Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) is an enhanced version of the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), developed by financial experts to address the limitations of traditional IRR in handling multiple cash flows and reinvestment assumptions. MIRR provides a more accurate assessment of investment returns by explicitly defining the reinvestment rate and financing cost. Its core concepts include separating cash flows into positive and negative parts, discounting or compounding them at the reinvestment rate and financing cost, respectively, to derive a more reasonable rate of return.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：MIRR广泛应用于资本预算、项目评估和投资决策中，特别是在现金流不稳定或存在多重现金流的场景下。例如，在评估长期基础设施项目时，MIRR能更准确地反映项目的真实回报率。需要注意的是，MIRR的计算依赖于再投资率和融资成本的合理假设，若假设不准确可能导致结果偏差。  
  **English Explanation**: MIRR is widely used in capital budgeting, project evaluation, and investment decision-making, especially in scenarios with unstable or multiple cash flows. For instance, when evaluating long-term infrastructure projects, MIRR can more accurately reflect the true rate of return. It is important to note that MIRR calculations rely on reasonable assumptions about the reinvestment rate and financing cost; inaccurate assumptions may lead to biased results.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，MIRR的重要性在于其提供了更稳健的投资回报评估工具。它弥补了传统IRR的不足，帮助投资者和管理者做出更科学的决策。在金融监管中，MIRR也被视为一种更透明的绩效衡量指标。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, MIRR is significant because it provides a more robust tool for assessing investment returns. It addresses the shortcomings of traditional IRR and helps investors and managers make more informed decisions. In financial regulation, MIRR is also regarded as a more transparent performance measurement metric.
