* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：货币总量（Monetary Aggregates）是指一国经济中流通的货币供应量的总和，通常根据货币的流动性和功能划分为不同层次，如M0、M1、M2等。这一概念由中央银行提出，用于衡量经济中的货币供应情况，是货币政策制定的重要依据。  
  **English Explanation**: Monetary aggregates refer to the total supply of money circulating in an economy, typically categorized into different levels such as M0, M1, and M2 based on liquidity and function. This concept, introduced by central banks, is used to measure the money supply in an economy and serves as a critical basis for monetary policy formulation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：货币总量广泛应用于货币政策制定、经济预测和金融市场分析中。例如，中央银行通过调整M2的增长率来控制通货膨胀或刺激经济增长。然而，过度依赖货币总量可能导致政策失误，特别是在金融创新和电子支付普及的背景下。  
  **English Explanation**: Monetary aggregates are widely used in monetary policy formulation, economic forecasting, and financial market analysis. For instance, central banks adjust the growth rate of M2 to control inflation or stimulate economic growth.
