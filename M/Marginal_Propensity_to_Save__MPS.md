# Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **边际储蓄倾向（MPS）** 是指每增加一单位收入中用于储蓄的比例。它是凯恩斯经济学中的一个核心概念，由英国经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出。MPS反映了消费者在收入增加时的储蓄行为，通常用公式表示为：MPS = ΔS / ΔY，其中ΔS代表储蓄的变化量，ΔY代表收入的变化量。  
  **Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)** refers to the proportion of each additional unit of income that is saved rather than spent. It is a core concept in Keynesian economics, introduced by British economist John Maynard Keynes in his seminal work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*. MPS reflects consumers' saving behavior when their income increases and is typically expressed as: MPS = ΔS / ΔY, where ΔS represents the change in savings and ΔY represents the change in income.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在宏观经济分析中，边际储蓄倾向用于预测经济政策的效果。例如，当政府实施减税政策时，如果居民的MPS较高，则减税对消费的刺激作用可能有限，因为大部分新增收入会被储蓄而非用于消费。此外，MPS也是计算乘数效应的重要参数之一。需要注意的是，MSP的高低受文化、经济环境和个人偏好等因素影响。  
  In macroeconomic analysis, MPS is used to predict the effects of economic policies. For example, when a government implements tax cuts, if households have a high MPS, the stimulus effect on consumption may be limited because most of the additional income will be saved rather than spent. Additionally, MPS is a key parameter in calculating the multiplier effect. It is important to note that the level of MPS is influenced by factors such as culture, economic environment, and individual preferences.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，了解边际储蓄倾向有助于制定更有效的财政和货币政策；从投资角度看，MSP的高低可以反映消费者的信心和未来消费趋势；从行业角度看，企业可以通过分析目标市场的MSP来调整生产和营销策略。因此，MSP是经济学研究和实践中的重要指标之一。  
  From a regulatory perspective, understanding MPS helps formulate more effective fiscal and monetary policies; from an investment perspective, the level of MPS can reflect consumer confidence and future consumption trends; from an industry perspective, businesses can adjust production and marketing strategies by analyzing the MPS of their target markets. Thus, MPS is an important indicator in economic research and practice.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  边际储蓄倾向的概念起源于20世纪30年代的大萧条时期。凯恩斯在其1936年出版的《就业、利息和货币通论》中首次系统阐述了这一概念。他提出这一理论是为了解释为什么在经济衰退期间，即使收入下降，人们仍然倾向于减少消费并增加储蓄（即“节俭悖论”），从而加剧了经济危机。这一理论为后来的宏观经济政策制定提供了重要依据。  
  The concept of Marginal Propensity to Save originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Keynes first systematically articulated this concept in his 1936 book *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*. He introduced this theory to explain why during economic recessions, even as incomes fell, people tended to reduce consumption and increase savings (the "paradox of thrift"), thereby exacerbating economic crises. This theory provided an important foundation for later macroeconomic policy-making.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  边际储蓄倾向的理论对现代经济学产生了深远影响。它不仅帮助解释了经济周期中的消费和储蓄行为变化，还为政府干预经济提供了理论支持。例如，“凯恩斯主义”政策主张在经济低迷时通过增加政府支出来刺激需求，而这一政策的有效性部分取决于居民的边际储蓄倾向。如今，MSP仍然是宏观经济学教科书中的核心内容之一。  
  The theory of Marginal Propensity to Save has had a profound impact on modern economics. It not only helps explain changes in consumption and saving behavior during economic cycles but also provides theoretical support for government intervention in the economy. For example, "Keynesian" policies advocate stimulating demand through increased government spending during economic downturns, and the effectiveness of such policies partly depends on households' marginal propensity to save. Today, MPS remains one of the core concepts in macroeconomics textbooks.
