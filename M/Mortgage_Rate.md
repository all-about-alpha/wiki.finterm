# Mortgage Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：抵押贷款利率是指借款人向银行或其他金融机构申请抵押贷款时，需要支付的利息比率。它通常以年利率的形式表示，是贷款成本的核心组成部分。抵押贷款利率的高低受多种因素影响，包括市场利率、借款人信用状况、贷款期限以及抵押物的价值等。  
  **English Explanation**: The mortgage rate is the interest rate charged by a bank or financial institution on a mortgage loan. It is typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR) and represents the cost of borrowing for the homeowner. The mortgage rate is influenced by various factors, including market interest rates, the borrower's creditworthiness, the loan term, and the value of the collateral.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：抵押贷款利率广泛应用于购房贷款、商业地产贷款等场景。借款人在选择贷款产品时，通常会比较不同金融机构的抵押贷款利率，以选择最优惠的方案。需要注意的是，较低的抵押贷款利率虽然能减少还款压力，但也可能伴随着更严格的贷款条件或更高的其他费用。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Mortgage rates are widely used in home loans, commercial real estate loans, and other financing scenarios. Borrowers often compare mortgage rates from different financial institutions to find the most favorable terms. It’s important to note that while lower mortgage rates can reduce repayment burdens, they may come with stricter loan conditions or higher additional fees.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，抵押贷款利率是央行调控房地产市场的重要工具之一；从投资角度看，它直接影响购房者的购买力和房地产市场的活跃度；从行业角度看，它是金融机构盈利的关键因素之一。因此，抵押贷款利率的变动对经济有着深远的影响。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, mortgage rates are a key tool for central banks to control the real estate market. From an investment standpoint, they directly impact homebuyers' purchasing power and market activity. From an industry perspective, they are a critical factor in financial institutions' profitability. Thus, changes in mortgage rates have profound economic implications.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：现代意义上的抵押贷款利率制度起源于20世纪初的美国。随着住房需求的增加和金融市场的成熟，银行开始提供长期住房贷款，并逐步形成了以利率为核心的定价机制。1929年大萧条后，美国政府通过《国家住房法》建立了联邦住房管理局（FHA），进一步规范了抵押贷款市场。  
  **English Origin**: The modern concept of mortgage rates originated in the early 20th century in the United States. As housing demand grew and financial markets matured, banks began offering long-term home loans and gradually developed interest rate-based pricing mechanisms. After the Great Depression of 1929, the U.S. government established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) through the National Housing Act, further standardizing the mortgage market.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：抵押贷款利率的引入和调整对全球房地产市场产生了深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机期间，美国次贷危机的爆发与低利率环境下的过度放贷密切相关。如今，各国央行通过调整基准利率来间接影响抵押贷款利率，从而调控经济周期和房地产市场走势。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction and adjustment of mortgage rates have had a profound impact on global real estate markets. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was closely linked to excessive lending under low-interest-rate conditions. Today, central banks worldwide influence mortgage rates by adjusting benchmark rates to regulate economic cycles and real estate trends.
