## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：外汇储备（Foreign Exchange Reserves）是指一国中央银行持有的外币资产，主要用于平衡国际收支、稳定汇率以及应对国际金融市场的波动。外汇储备通常包括外币现金、外币存款、外币有价证券以及其他国际支付手段。其核心概念是确保国家在国际贸易和金融活动中的支付能力和信用。  
  **English Explanation**: Foreign exchange reserves refer to the foreign currency assets held by a country's central bank, primarily used to balance international payments, stabilize exchange rates, and respond to fluctuations in the international financial markets. These reserves typically include foreign currency cash, deposits, securities, and other international payment instruments. The core concept is to ensure a country's payment capability and creditworthiness in international trade and financial activities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：外汇储备广泛应用于国际贸易结算、外债偿还、汇率干预以及应对金融危机等场景。例如，当一国货币面临贬值压力时，中央银行可以通过抛售外汇储备来稳定汇率。然而，过度依赖外汇储备也可能导致资产配置失衡或外汇市场波动风险。  
  **English Application**: Foreign exchange reserves are widely used in international trade settlements, external debt repayments, exchange rate interventions, and crisis management. For instance, when a country's currency faces depreciation pressure, the central bank can stabilize the exchange rate by selling foreign exchange reserves. However, over-reliance on reserves may lead to asset allocation imbalances or risks of foreign exchange market volatility.

  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，外汇储备是衡量一国经济实力和金融稳定的重要指标；从投资角度看，充足的外汇储备能增强投资者信心；从行业角度看，外汇储备的规模和管理水平直接影响国际贸易和金融活动的顺利进行。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, foreign exchange reserves are a key indicator of a country's economic strength and financial stability. From an investment perspective, sufficient reserves boost investor confidence. From an industry perspective, the scale and management of reserves directly impact the smooth operation of international trade and financial activities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：外汇储备的概念起源于19世纪末的金本位制时期。当时，各国央行开始积累黄金和外汇以支持货币发行和国际贸易。二战后，布雷顿森林体系的建立进一步强化了外汇储备的重要性，美元成为主要储备货币。20世纪70年代，随着浮动汇率制的普及，外汇储备的管理逐渐成为各国央行的重要职能。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of foreign exchange reserves originated during the late 19th century under the gold standard system. Central banks began accumulating gold and foreign currencies to support currency issuance and international trade. After World War II, the Bretton Woods system further emphasized the importance of reserves, with the US dollar becoming the primary reserve currency. In the 1970s, with the rise of floating exchange rates, reserve management became a critical function for central banks worldwide.

  **English Impact**: The accumulation and management of foreign exchange reserves have profoundly influenced the global economic landscape. For example, China's foreign exchange reserves have long ranked first globally, providing strong support for its international trade and financial activities.
