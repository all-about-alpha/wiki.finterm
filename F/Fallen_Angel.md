## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  堕落天使的概念最早出现在20世纪80年代美国高收益债券市场兴起时期。当时，许多原本评级较高的公司因经济衰退或行业调整而遭遇信用评级下调，成为“堕落天使”。这一现象在2008年全球金融危机期间尤为显著，大量金融机构和企业的债券被降级。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of Fallen Angels emerged in the 1980s during the rise of the high-yield bond market in the United States. Many companies that were originally rated as investment-grade saw their credit ratings downgraded due to economic recessions or industry shifts, becoming "Fallen Angels." This phenomenon was particularly prominent during the 2008 global financial crisis, when numerous financial institutions and corporations experienced downgrades.
