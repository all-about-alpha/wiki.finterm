# Form 2106

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Form 2106，即《员工业务费用表》，是美国国税局（IRS）要求纳税人填报的一种税务表格，主要用于申报与工作相关的未报销业务费用。这些费用包括交通费、餐饮费、住宿费等，但必须符合IRS规定的“普通且必要”标准。  
  **English Explanation**: Form 2106, also known as the "Employee Business Expenses" form, is a tax form required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to report unreimbursed business expenses related to their employment. These expenses may include travel, meals, lodging, and other costs, provided they meet the IRS criteria of being "ordinary and necessary."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Form 2106适用于那些在工作中产生自付费用但未获得雇主全额报销的员工。例如，销售人员因出差产生的交通费、餐饮费等。需要注意的是，自2018年起，由于《减税与就业法案》（TCJA）的实施，大多数员工已无法在联邦税表中扣除这些费用，但某些特定职业（如军人、表演艺术家等）仍可使用此表格。  
  **English Application**: Form 2106 is applicable to employees who incur out-of-pocket expenses for work that are not fully reimbursed by their employer. For example, sales representatives may use this form to report travel and meal expenses incurred during business trips. However, starting in 2018, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), most employees can no longer deduct these expenses on their federal tax returns, except for certain professions such as military personnel and performing artists.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：Form 2106在税务申报中具有重要意义，尤其是在2018年之前，它为员工提供了合法减税的机会。尽管TCJA限制了其适用范围，但对于特定职业的员工而言，它仍然是优化税务负担的重要工具。此外，该表格的使用也反映了雇主与员工之间费用报销政策的透明度。  
  **English Significance**: Form 2106 holds significant importance in tax filing, particularly before 2018, as it provided employees with a legal means to reduce their taxable income. Although the TCJA has limited its applicability, it remains a crucial tool for certain professions to optimize their tax liabilities. Additionally, the use of this form reflects the transparency of expense reimbursement policies between employers and employees.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：Form 2106最早由美国国税局引入，旨在规范员工业务费用的申报流程。其设计初衷是为了确保员工能够合理申报与工作相关的费用，同时防止滥用税务减免政策。2018年，《减税与就业法案》的通过大幅调整了员工业务费用的扣除规则，使得Form 2106的适用范围显著缩小。  
  **English Origin**: Form 2106 was initially introduced by the IRS to standardize the reporting process for employee business expenses. Its original purpose was to ensure that employees could legitimately claim work-related expenses while preventing the misuse of tax deduction policies. In 2018, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly altered the rules for deducting employee business expenses, greatly reducing the scope of Form 2106.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：Form 2106的引入和后续调整对美国的税务体系产生了深远影响。在2018年之前，该表格被广泛使用，帮助员工合法降低税负。然而，TCJA的实施使得大多数员工无法再享受这一福利，从而改变了员工与雇主之间的费用报销模式。尽管如此，Form 2106在特定职业中仍具有重要价值。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction and subsequent adjustments to Form 2106 have had a profound impact on the U.S. tax system. Before 2018, the form was widely used to help employees legally reduce their tax burden. However, the implementation of the TCJA eliminated this benefit for most employees, altering the dynamics of expense reimbursement between employees and employers. Despite this, Form 2106 remains valuable for certain professions.
