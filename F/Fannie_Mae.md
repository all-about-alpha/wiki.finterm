# Fannie Mae

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：房利美（Fannie Mae），全称为联邦国民抵押贷款协会（Federal National Mortgage Association），是美国政府赞助的企业（GSE），成立于1938年。其主要职能是购买和担保住房抵押贷款，以增加住房贷款的流动性，促进住房市场的稳定和发展。房利美通过将抵押贷款打包成证券化产品（MBS）出售给投资者，从而为房地产市场提供资金支持。  
  - **English Explanation**: Fannie Mae, officially known as the Federal National Mortgage Association, is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) established in 1938. Its primary function is to purchase and guarantee residential mortgages, thereby increasing the liquidity of housing loans and promoting stability and growth in the housing market. Fannie Mae achieves this by securitizing mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and selling them to investors, providing funding for the real estate market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：房利美的主要应用场景包括为银行和其他贷款机构提供流动性支持，使其能够发放更多的住房贷款。此外，房利美通过购买和担保抵押贷款，降低了贷款机构的信用风险，从而使得更多家庭能够获得住房贷款。需要注意的是，房利美的运作依赖于美国政府的隐性担保，因此在金融危机期间（如2008年次贷危机），其风险暴露较为明显。  
  - **English Application**: Fannie Mae's primary application involves providing liquidity support to banks and other lending institutions, enabling them to issue more housing loans. Additionally, by purchasing and guaranteeing mortgages, Fannie Mae reduces the credit risk for lenders, making home loans more accessible to families. It is important to note that Fannie Mae's operations rely on the implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, which became particularly evident during financial crises, such as the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，房利美是美国住房金融体系的核心组成部分，其稳定运行对维护住房市场的流动性至关重要。从投资角度看，房利美发行的抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）是固定收益市场的重要投资工具。从行业角度看，房利美的存在促进了住房贷款市场的繁荣，支持了美国住房政策的实施。  
  - **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Fannie Mae is a cornerstone of the U.S. housing finance system, and its stable operation is crucial for maintaining liquidity in the housing market. From an investment standpoint, the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by Fannie Mae are key instruments in the fixed-income market. From an industry perspective, Fannie Mae's existence fosters the prosperity of the housing loan market and supports the implementation of U.S. housing policies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  - **中文起源**：房利美成立于1938年，正值大萧条时期，美国政府为了应对住房危机，成立了房利美以增加住房贷款的流动性。最初，房利美是作为联邦政府机构运营的，直到1968年，房利美被私有化，成为一家政府赞助的企业（GSE）。

By providing liquidity support, Fannie Mae has enabled millions of families to obtain housing loans, contributing to the rise in homeownership rates in the U.S. However, during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, Fannie Mae faced significant challenges due to its holdings of high-risk mortgages and was ultimately placed under government conservatorship.
