# Federal Funds

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  联邦基金（Federal Funds）是指美国商业银行存放在联邦储备银行（Federal Reserve Bank）的存款准备金中，超过法定准备金要求的部分。这些资金可以用于银行之间的短期借贷，通常以隔夜贷款的形式进行。联邦基金利率（Federal Funds Rate）是银行间借贷这些资金的利率，由市场供求关系决定，但受美联储（Federal Reserve）的政策目标影响。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Federal Funds refer to the excess reserves that commercial banks hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, beyond the required reserve amount. These funds are used for short-term lending between banks, typically in the form of overnight loans. The Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate at which these funds are lent between banks, determined by market supply and demand but influenced by the Federal Reserve's policy objectives.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  联邦基金主要用于银行之间的短期流动性管理。当一家银行的准备金不足时，可以通过联邦基金市场向其他银行借入资金，以满足法定准备金要求或应对临时资金需求。联邦基金利率是金融市场的重要基准利率，影响其他短期利率如LIBOR（伦敦银行同业拆借利率）和国债利率。  
  **风险提示**：联邦基金市场的利率波动可能影响银行的资金成本，进而影响贷款利率和整体经济。  
  **English Application**  
  Federal Funds are primarily used for short-term liquidity management between banks. When a bank faces a reserve shortfall, it can borrow funds from other banks in the Federal Funds market to meet reserve requirements or address temporary funding needs. The Federal Funds Rate is a key benchmark rate in financial markets, influencing other short-term rates such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) and Treasury rates.  
  **Risk Note**: Fluctuations in the Federal Funds Rate can impact banks' funding costs, which in turn affect lending rates and the broader economy.

* **重要性 / Significance**

  **English Significance**
