## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  财务表现（Financial Performance）是指企业或个人在一定时期内通过财务报表（如利润表、资产负债表、现金流量表等）反映的经济活动成果。它通常用于衡量企业的盈利能力、偿债能力、运营效率及成长潜力。核心概念包括收入、利润、现金流、资产回报率（ROA）和股东权益回报率（ROE）等。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Financial Performance refers to the results of economic activities of a business or individual over a specific period, as reflected in financial statements (such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements). It is commonly used to measure profitability, solvency, operational efficiency, and growth potential. Key concepts include revenue, profit, cash flow, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  财务表现广泛应用于企业内部分析、投资者决策、银行信贷评估及监管机构审查。例如，投资者通过分析企业的财务表现来判断其股票是否值得投资；银行则通过评估企业的偿债能力来决定是否发放贷款。需要注意的是，财务表现可能受到会计政策、市场环境等因素的影响，因此需结合非财务指标进行综合评估。  
  **English Application**  
  Financial Performance is widely used in internal corporate analysis, investor decision-making, bank credit assessments, and regulatory reviews. For instance, investors analyze a company's financial performance to determine whether its stock is worth investing in, while banks evaluate a company's solvency to decide whether to grant loans. It is important to note that financial performance can be influenced by accounting policies, market conditions, and other factors, so it should be assessed alongside non-financial indicators.
