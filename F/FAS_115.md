# FAS 115

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  FAS 115，全称为《财务会计准则第115号》（Financial Accounting Standards No. 115），由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）于1993年发布。该准则主要规范企业对债务和权益证券投资的会计处理，要求企业将这些投资分为三类：持有至到期投资、交易性金融资产和可供出售金融资产，并分别采用不同的会计处理方法。  
  FAS 115, officially known as Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 1993. This standard primarily governs the accounting treatment of investments in debt and equity securities by enterprises. It requires companies to classify these investments into three categories: held-to-maturity securities, trading securities, and available-for-sale securities, each subject to different accounting treatments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，FAS 115的核心原则被广泛应用于金融机构和企业的财务报表编制中，特别是在处理债券和股票投资时。企业需根据投资目的和持有期限对金融资产进行分类，并按照公允价值或摊余成本进行计量。需要注意的是，分类错误可能导致财务报表失真，进而影响投资者决策。  
  In China, the core principles of FAS 115 are widely applied in the preparation of financial statements by financial institutions and enterprises, especially when dealing with bond and equity investments. Companies must classify financial assets based on their investment purpose and holding period, and measure them at fair value or amortized cost. It is important to note that misclassification can lead to distorted financial statements, thereby affecting investor decisions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，FAS 115为金融资产的会计处理提供了统一标准，增强了财务报表的可比性和透明度。从投资角度看，它帮助投资者更好地理解企业的投资策略和风险状况。从行业角度看，该准则推动了金融工具会计处理的规范化，促进了资本市场的健康发展。  
  From a regulatory perspective, FAS 115 provides a unified standard for the accounting treatment of financial assets, enhancing the comparability and transparency of financial statements. From an investment perspective, it helps investors better understand a company's investment strategies and risk profile. From an industry perspective, the standard promotes the standardization of accounting practices for financial instruments and fosters the healthy development of capital markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  FAS 115的制定背景可以追溯到20世纪80年代末至90年代初，当时美国金融市场快速发展，金融工具种类日益复杂。为了应对这一变化，FASB于1993年发布了FAS 115，旨在解决金融资产分类和计量方法不统一的问题。该准则的制定过程历时多年，经历了多次公开讨论和修订。  
  The development of FAS 115 can be traced back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the U.S. financial market was rapidly evolving, and financial instruments were becoming increasingly complex. To address these changes, the FASB issued FAS 115 in 1993, aiming to resolve inconsistencies in the classification and measurement of financial assets. The development process spanned several years and involved multiple rounds of public discussions and revisions.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  FAS 115的发布对全球金融行业产生了深远影响。它不仅在美国广泛应用，还被许多国家和地区借鉴，成为国际财务报告准则（IFRS）中金融工具会计处理的重要参考。在中国，FAS 115的原则被纳入企业会计准则，推动了国内金融资产会计处理的规范化。  
  The issuance of FAS 115 had a profound impact on the global financial industry. It was not only widely adopted in the United States but also served as an important reference for the accounting treatment of financial instruments under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
