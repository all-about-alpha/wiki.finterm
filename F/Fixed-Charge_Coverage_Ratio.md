# Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：固定费用保障比率（Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio, FCCR）是衡量企业支付固定费用能力的财务指标。固定费用通常包括利息支出、租赁费用和其他必须支付的固定债务。该比率通过比较企业的息税前利润（EBIT）与固定费用，评估企业在支付固定费用后的剩余利润能力。公式为：  
  \[
  \text{固定费用保障比率} = \frac{\text{息税前利润（EBIT） + 固定费用}}{\text{固定费用}}
  \]  
  该比率越高，表明企业支付固定费用的能力越强，财务风险越低。

  **English Explanation**: The Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR) is a financial metric used to measure a company's ability to cover its fixed charges, such as interest payments, lease obligations, and other fixed debts. It compares a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to its fixed charges, assessing the remaining profit after covering these obligations. The formula is:  
  \[
  \text{Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT + Fixed Charges}}{\text{Fixed Charges}}
  \]  
  A higher ratio indicates a stronger ability to meet fixed obligations and lower financial risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：固定费用保障比率广泛应用于企业财务分析和信用评级中。投资者和债权人使用该比率评估企业的偿债能力和财务健康状况。例如，银行在发放贷款时，会要求企业提供该比率以判断其还款能力。此外，企业管理层也可利用该比率进行内部财务规划，确保有足够的现金流支付固定费用。需要注意的是，该比率未考虑企业的资本结构变化，因此在分析时应结合其他财务指标。

  **English Explanation**: The Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio is widely used in corporate financial analysis and credit rating. Investors and creditors use this ratio to assess a company's debt repayment capacity and financial health. For example, banks may require this ratio when issuing loans to evaluate a company's ability to repay. Additionally, company management can use this ratio for internal financial planning to ensure sufficient cash flow for fixed obligations. It is important to note that this ratio does not account for changes in capital structure, so it should be analyzed alongside other financial metrics.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，固定费用保障比率具有重要意义。监管机构通过该比率监控企业的财务稳定性，防止过度负债。投资者则利用该比率评估企业的财务风险，决定是否投资。对于行业而言，该比率是衡量企业竞争力的重要指标，尤其是在资本密集型行业（如制造业和房地产），固定费用较高，该比率尤为重要。

  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio is highly significant. Regulatory bodies use this ratio to monitor a company's financial stability and prevent excessive debt. Investors rely on it to assess financial risk and make investment decisions. For industries, especially capital-intensive sectors like manufacturing and real estate, this ratio is a critical measure of competitiveness, as fixed charges tend to be higher in these fields.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：固定费用保障比率的起源可以追溯到20世纪初，随着企业融资需求的增加和债券市场的兴起，债权人和投资者开始关注企业的偿债能力。20世纪30年代大萧条期间，许多企业因无法支付固定费用而破产，促使财务分析师开发出该比率以评估企业的财务健康状况。此后，该比率逐渐成为财务分析中的标准工具。

  **English Explanation**: The Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio originated in the early 20th century, coinciding with the rise of corporate financing needs and bond markets. Creditors and investors began focusing on companies' debt repayment capabilities. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many companies went bankrupt due to their inability to cover fixed charges, prompting financial analysts to develop this ratio to assess financial health. Over time, it became a standard tool in financial analysis.
