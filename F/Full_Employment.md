# Full Employment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：充分就业（Full Employment）是一个经济学概念，指的是在一个经济体中，所有愿意工作且有能力工作的人都能找到工作，且失业率处于自然失业率水平的状态。自然失业率通常包括摩擦性失业和结构性失业，但不包括周期性失业。这一概念最早由英国经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出，强调通过政府干预实现经济稳定和就业最大化。  
  **English Explanation**: Full Employment is an economic concept referring to a situation in which all individuals willing and able to work can find employment, and the unemployment rate is at the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate includes frictional and structural unemployment but excludes cyclical unemployment. This concept was first introduced by British economist John Maynard Keynes in his work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*, emphasizing government intervention to achieve economic stability and maximize employment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：充分就业通常被用作宏观经济政策的目标之一，尤其是在经济衰退或高失业率时期。政府通过财政政策（如增加公共支出）和货币政策（如降低利率）来刺激经济增长，从而促进就业。然而，过度追求充分就业可能导致通货膨胀或资源错配，因此需要在就业目标和物价稳定之间找到平衡。  
  **English Application**: Full Employment is often used as a macroeconomic policy goal, particularly during economic recessions or periods of high unemployment. Governments stimulate economic growth through fiscal policies (e.g., increasing public spending) and monetary policies (e.g., lowering interest rates) to promote employment. However, excessive pursuit of full employment may lead to inflation or resource misallocation, necessitating a balance between employment goals and price stability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，充分就业是衡量经济健康的重要指标，也是政府制定政策的核心目标之一。从投资角度看，充分就业通常意味着经济处于扩张期，企业盈利增长，股市表现良好。从行业角度看，充分就业有助于提高居民收入，促进消费和经济增长。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, full employment is a key indicator of economic health and a central goal of government policy-making. From an investment perspective, full employment often signals an economic expansion, with rising corporate profits and strong stock market performance. From an industry perspective, full employment boosts household income, driving consumption and economic growth.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：充分就业的概念起源于20世纪30年代的大萧条时期。当时，全球经济陷入严重衰退，失业率居高不下。凯恩斯在其1936年出版的《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出，政府应通过增加公共支出和刺激需求来解决失业问题，从而实现充分就业。这一理论成为现代宏观经济学的基石之一。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of full employment originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s, a period of severe global economic downturn and high unemployment. In his 1936 work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*, Keynes argued that governments should address unemployment by increasing public spending and stimulating demand to achieve full employment. This theory became a cornerstone of modern macroeconomics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：充分就业理论对全球经济政策产生了深远影响。二战后，许多国家将充分就业作为经济政策的核心目标，推动了社会福利制度和公共服务的完善。然而，20世纪70年代的滞胀危机（高通胀与高失业并存）暴露了凯恩斯主义政策的局限性，促使经济学家重新思考充分就业的定义和实现路径。  
  **English Impact**: The theory of full employment has had a profound impact on global economic policies. After World War II, many countries adopted full employment as a central economic goal, driving the development of social welfare systems and public services. However, the stagflation crisis of the 1970s (high inflation coupled with high unemployment) revealed the limitations of Keynesian policies, prompting economists to reconsider the definition and pathways to achieving full employment.
