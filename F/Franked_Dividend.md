# Franked Dividend

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  已税股息（Franked Dividend）是指公司在向股东分配股息时，已经为其缴纳了企业所得税的部分。这意味着股东在收到股息时，可以享受税收抵免，避免重复征税。这一概念起源于澳大利亚等国家的税收制度，旨在避免公司利润在公司层面和股东层面被双重征税。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Franked Dividend refers to a dividend distributed by a company to its shareholders that has already been subject to corporate income tax. This allows shareholders to receive a tax credit, avoiding double taxation on the same income. The concept originated in countries like Australia as part of their tax systems to prevent corporate profits from being taxed both at the corporate level and the shareholder level.

It is important to note that tax policies vary by country, and the specific application and tax benefits of franked dividends may differ.
