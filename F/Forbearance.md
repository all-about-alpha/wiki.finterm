# Forbearance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Forbearance（宽容期或暂缓还款）是指贷款人在借款人暂时无法按时偿还贷款时，同意暂时推迟或减少还款金额的一种安排。这种安排通常是为了帮助借款人度过短期的财务困难，避免违约或破产。核心概念包括“暂缓还款”和“避免违约”。  
  **English Explanation**: Forbearance refers to an agreement between a lender and a borrower where the lender allows the borrower to temporarily postpone or reduce loan payments. This arrangement is typically made to help the borrower overcome short-term financial difficulties and avoid default or bankruptcy. Key concepts include "temporary payment relief" and "default prevention."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Forbearance常见于个人贷款、学生贷款和抵押贷款领域。例如，在经济衰退或突发财务危机（如失业或疾病）时，借款人可以向贷款机构申请暂缓还款。需要注意的是，暂缓还款期间利息可能继续累积，且借款人需在宽限期结束后补足未还款项。  
  **English Application**: Forbearance is commonly applied in personal loans, student loans, and mortgage loans. For instance, during an economic downturn or sudden financial crisis (e.g., job loss or illness), borrowers can request forbearance from lenders. It is important to note that interest may continue to accrue during the forbearance period, and borrowers are typically required to catch up on missed payments after the forbearance ends.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，Forbearance有助于维护金融系统的稳定性，减少大规模违约风险。从投资角度看，它为借款人提供了缓冲期，避免资产被强制清算。从行业角度看，Forbearance是金融机构履行社会责任的重要体现。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, forbearance helps maintain financial system stability by reducing the risk of widespread defaults. From an investment perspective, it provides borrowers with a buffer period to avoid forced asset liquidation. From an industry perspective, forbearance is an important way for financial institutions to fulfill their social responsibilities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：Forbearance的概念最早可追溯到中世纪欧洲的债务宽限制度。当时，教会和贵族阶层会允许农民在自然灾害或战争期间暂缓缴纳租金或债务。现代Forbearance制度的形成则与20世纪的经济危机密切相关，尤其是2008年全球金融危机期间，许多银行和金融机构推出了大规模的暂缓还款计划。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of forbearance dates back to medieval Europe's debt relief systems, where churches and nobility allowed peasants to defer rent or debt payments during natural disasters or wars. The modern forbearance system evolved in response to 20th-century economic crises, particularly during the 2008 global financial crisis, when many banks and financial institutions implemented large-scale forbearance programs.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：Forbearance在金融危机期间发挥了重要作用，帮助大量借款人避免了违约和资产损失。然而，长期依赖Forbearance可能导致借款人债务负担加重，甚至引发系统性风险。目前，Forbearance已成为全球金融监管和风险管理的重要工具之一。  
  **English Impact**: Forbearance played a critical role during financial crises by helping numerous borrowers avoid defaults and asset losses. However, prolonged reliance on forbearance can exacerbate borrowers' debt burdens and potentially lead to systemic risks. Today, forbearance is a key tool in global financial regulation and risk management.
