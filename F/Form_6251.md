When filling out this form, taxpayers must detail their income sources, tax preference items, and the AMT calculation process.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：替代性最低税（AMT）制度起源于1969年，当时美国政府发现一些高收入纳税人通过利用税务优惠项目几乎不缴纳任何税款。为了应对这一问题，国会通过了AMT制度，旨在确保所有纳税人支付最低限度的税款。Form 6251作为AMT的计算工具，随着AMT制度的实施而诞生。  
  **English Origin**: The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) system originated in 1969 when the U.S. government discovered that some high-income taxpayers were paying little to no taxes by exploiting tax preference items. To address this issue, Congress enacted the AMT system to ensure that all taxpayers pay a minimum amount of tax. Form 6251, as a tool for calculating AMT, was introduced alongside the implementation of the AMT system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：AMT制度的实施对高收入纳税人和税务规划行业产生了深远影响。它改变了纳税人的税务策略，促使更多人关注税务优惠项目的实际影响。尽管AMT制度在一定程度上达到了其初衷，但也因其复杂性而受到批评。目前，AMT仍然是美国税务体系中的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**: The implementation of the AMT system has had a profound impact on high-income taxpayers and the tax planning industry. It has altered taxpayers' tax strategies, prompting more people to consider the actual impact of tax preference items. While the AMT system has achieved its original purpose to some extent, it has also been criticized for its complexity. Currently, AMT remains a significant component of the U.S. tax system.
