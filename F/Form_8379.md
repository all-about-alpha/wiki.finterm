## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  Form 8379的起源可以追溯到20世纪80年代，当时美国国会通过了一系列法律，允许政府扣押纳税人的退款以抵偿未偿债务。然而，这一政策在夫妻共同报税时引发了不公平问题，即无辜配偶的退款可能被用于抵偿另一方的债务。为了解决这一问题，IRS于1990年代推出了Form 8379，旨在为受伤配偶提供法律保护。  

  **English Origin**  
  The origin of Form 8379 dates back to the 1980s when the U.S. Congress passed laws allowing the government to offset taxpayers' refunds to satisfy unpaid debts. However, this policy created inequities in cases of joint tax returns, where an innocent spouse's refund could be used to pay the other spouse's debts. To address this issue, the IRS introduced Form 8379 in the 1990s to provide legal protection for injured spouses.
