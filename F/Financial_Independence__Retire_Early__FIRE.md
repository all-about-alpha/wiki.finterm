# Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    财务独立，提前退休（FIRE）是一种生活方式和财务规划理念，旨在通过储蓄、投资和降低生活成本，实现财务自由，从而在相对年轻的时候退休。这一概念的核心在于通过高储蓄率和理性消费，积累足够的财富，以被动收入覆盖生活开支，摆脱对传统工作的依赖。FIRE运动的起源可以追溯到20世纪90年代，由Vicki Robin和Joe Dominguez在其著作《Your Money or Your Life》中提出，后经网络社区和博客广泛传播。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a lifestyle and financial planning philosophy aimed at achieving financial freedom through saving, investing, and reducing living expenses, enabling individuals to retire at a relatively young age. The core concept revolves around accumulating sufficient wealth through high savings rates and rational spending, allowing passive income to cover living expenses and eliminating reliance on traditional employment. The FIRE movement traces its origins to the 1990s, popularized by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez in their book *Your Money or Your Life*, and later spread through online communities and blogs.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景与风险提示**  
    FIRE理念适用于那些希望摆脱传统工作束缚、追求生活自主权的人群。常见的应用场景包括：通过投资股票、房地产或指数基金积累财富；降低生活成本，如选择简约生活方式或搬到生活成本较低的地区；以及通过副业或创业增加收入来源。然而，FIRE也存在风险，例如市场波动可能导致投资回报不稳定，过早退休可能面临长寿风险（即储蓄不足以覆盖晚年生活），以及过度节俭可能影响生活质量。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    The FIRE philosophy is suitable for individuals seeking to break free from traditional employment and pursue greater life autonomy. Common applications include building wealth through investments in stocks, real estate, or index funds; reducing living expenses by adopting minimalist lifestyles or relocating to lower-cost areas; and increasing income through side hustles or entrepreneurship. However, FIRE also carries risks, such as market volatility leading to unstable investment returns, longevity risk (insufficient savings for later life), and potential declines in quality of life due to excessive frugality.
