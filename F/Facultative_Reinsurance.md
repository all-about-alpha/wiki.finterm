# Facultative Reinsurance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  临时再保险（Facultative Reinsurance）是指原保险公司针对某一特定风险或保单，逐笔与再保险公司协商并达成再保险协议的一种再保险形式。其核心特点是“逐笔协商”，即每一笔再保险交易都是独立的，再保险公司有权选择是否接受该风险。这种再保险方式通常用于高风险、大额或非标准化的保险业务。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Facultative reinsurance refers to a type of reinsurance where the primary insurer negotiates and agrees on a reinsurance contract with a reinsurer for a specific risk or policy on a case-by-case basis. The key feature is "case-by-case negotiation," meaning each reinsurance transaction is independent, and the reinsurer has the right to decide whether to accept the risk. This form of reinsurance is typically used for high-risk, large-value, or non-standard insurance businesses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  临时再保险常用于承保大型工程项目、自然灾害风险、航空保险等高价值或高风险业务。由于这些业务的风险难以通过常规再保险方式分散，原保险公司会逐笔与再保险公司协商，以确保风险得到有效转移。需要注意的是，临时再保险的谈判过程较为复杂，且成本较高，因此通常仅用于特殊或非常规业务。  
  **English Application**  
  Facultative reinsurance is commonly used for insuring large-scale projects, natural disaster risks, aviation insurance, and other high-value or high-risk businesses. Since these risks are difficult to disperse through standard reinsurance methods, primary insurers negotiate with reinsurers on a case-by-case basis to ensure effective risk transfer. It is important to note that the negotiation process for facultative reinsurance is complex and costly, making it suitable only for special or non-standard businesses.

* **重要性 / Significance**

  从监管角度看，临时再保险有助于原保险公司管理极端风险，确保其偿付能力；从投资角度看，它为再保险公司提供了参与高收益业务的机会；从行业角度看，临时再保险促进了保险市场的风险分散和创新，特别是在应对新兴风险（如气候变化相关风险）方面发挥了重要作用。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, facultative reinsurance helps primary insurers manage extreme risks and ensure solvency. From an investment perspective, it provides reinsurers with opportunities to participate in high-yield businesses.

  临时再保险的起源可以追溯到19世纪中叶，随着工业革命的推进，保险业面临的风险日益复杂化和多样化。早期的再保险形式主要是比例再保险，但随着大型工程项目和特殊风险的出现，保险公司开始采用逐笔协商的方式与再保险公司合作。20世纪初，临时再保险逐渐成为一种独立的再保险形式，并在全球范围内得到广泛应用。

  The origin of facultative reinsurance dates back to the mid-19th century, as the Industrial Revolution led to increasingly complex and diverse risks in the insurance industry. Early forms of reinsurance were primarily proportional, but with the emergence of large-scale projects and special risks, insurers began to adopt case-by-case negotiations with reinsurers. By the early 20th century, facultative reinsurance had evolved into a distinct form of reinsurance and gained widespread global application.
