# First Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：第一抵押权（First Mortgage）是指借款人以某一特定不动产作为抵押物，向贷款人申请贷款时，该抵押物上设立的第一个抵押权。第一抵押权人在债务人违约时，拥有优先于其他债权人（如第二抵押权人）从抵押物变现中受偿的权利。  
  **English Explanation**: A First Mortgage is the primary lien on a specific piece of real estate that a borrower uses as collateral to secure a loan. The holder of the first mortgage has priority over other creditors (such as second mortgage holders) in the event of default, meaning they are first in line to receive repayment from the sale of the property.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：第一抵押权广泛应用于房地产贷款中，如购房按揭贷款。借款人将所购房产作为抵押物，银行作为第一抵押权人提供贷款。若借款人无法偿还贷款，银行有权优先处置房产以收回贷款。需要注意的是，第一抵押权的优先性使其风险较低，但借款人需承担较高的利率和严格的还款要求。  
  **English Application**: First Mortgages are commonly used in real estate financing, such as home purchase loans. The borrower pledges the purchased property as collateral, and the bank, as the first mortgage holder, provides the loan. If the borrower defaults, the bank has the right to foreclose on the property to recover the loan. It is important to note that the priority of the first mortgage reduces risk for the lender, but borrowers face higher interest rates and stricter repayment terms.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，第一抵押权是金融体系稳定的重要组成部分，因其优先受偿权降低了银行的风险敞口。从投资角度看，第一抵押权被视为低风险资产，常被用于资产证券化产品（如MBS）。从行业角度看，第一抵押权推动了房地产市场的繁荣，为购房者提供了融资渠道。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, first mortgages are a cornerstone of financial stability due to their priority in repayment, which reduces banks' risk exposure. From an investment standpoint, first mortgages are considered low-risk assets and are often used in securitized products like Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). From an industry perspective, first mortgages facilitate the growth of the real estate market by providing financing options for homebuyers.
