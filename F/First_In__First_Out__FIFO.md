# First In, First Out (FIFO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：先进先出法（FIFO）是一种库存管理方法，最早起源于会计和仓储管理领域。其核心概念是假设最早进入库存的商品或材料最先被使用或售出。这种方法在计算成本时，优先使用最早购入的库存成本，从而影响企业的利润和税务计算。  
  **English Explanation**: First In, First Out (FIFO) is an inventory management method that originated in the fields of accounting and warehouse management. Its core concept assumes that the oldest inventory items are used or sold first. This method prioritizes the cost of the earliest purchased inventory when calculating costs, thereby impacting a company's profit and tax calculations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：FIFO广泛应用于制造业、零售业和物流行业。例如，在食品行业，由于商品易腐，FIFO法确保最早生产的商品最先售出，减少浪费。在会计中，FIFO用于计算库存成本，尤其在通胀环境下，可能高估利润。需要注意的是，FIFO可能导致税务负担增加，因为较早的低成本库存被优先计入成本。  
  **English Application**: FIFO is widely used in manufacturing, retail, and logistics industries. For example, in the food industry, due to the perishable nature of goods, FIFO ensures that the earliest produced items are sold first, reducing waste. In accounting, FIFO is used to calculate inventory costs, especially in inflationary environments, which may overstate profits. It is important to note that FIFO may increase tax burdens because older, lower-cost inventory is prioritized in cost calculations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，FIFO是国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和美国通用会计准则（GAAP）认可的方法之一，确保了财务报表的可比性。从投资角度看，FIFO在通胀期间可能高估企业利润，影响投资者决策。从行业角度看，FIFO有助于优化库存管理，减少过期或滞销风险。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, FIFO is one of the methods recognized by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), ensuring comparability in financial statements. From an investment perspective, FIFO may overstate profits during inflationary periods, affecting investor decisions. From an industry perspective, FIFO helps optimize inventory management and reduces the risk of obsolescence or overstocking.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：FIFO的概念最早可追溯到19世纪的工业革命时期，当时大规模生产需要高效的库存管理方法。20世纪初，随着会计学的发展，FIFO被正式纳入成本计算方法。其发现过程与仓储管理的实际需求密切相关，尤其是在食品和易腐品行业。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of FIFO dates back to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century when mass production required efficient inventory management methods. In the early 20th century, with the development of accounting, FIFO was formally incorporated into cost calculation methods. Its discovery process was closely related to the practical needs of warehouse management, especially in the food and perishable goods industries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：FIFO对全球供应链和会计实践产生了深远影响。在食品、医药等行业，FIFO成为标准操作流程，确保产品质量和安全。在会计领域，FIFO与其他成本计算方法（如后进先出法LIFO）共同构成了企业财务管理的基石。目前，FIFO仍是许多国家的主流库存计价方法。  
  **English Impact**: FIFO has had a profound impact on global supply chains and accounting practices. In industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, FIFO has become a standard operating procedure, ensuring product quality and safety. In the field of accounting, FIFO, along with other cost calculation methods (such as Last In, First Out, or LIFO), forms the cornerstone of corporate financial management. Currently, FIFO remains the mainstream inventory valuation method in many countries.
