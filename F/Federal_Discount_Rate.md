# Federal Discount Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：联邦贴现率（Federal Discount Rate）是指美国联邦储备银行（美联储）向商业银行和其他存款机构提供短期贷款的利率。它是美联储调控货币供应量和影响经济活动的关键工具之一。联邦贴现率通常高于联邦基金利率，旨在鼓励银行通过市场融资而非直接向美联储借款。  
  **English Explanation**: The Federal Discount Rate is the interest rate charged by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to commercial banks and other depository institutions for short-term loans. It is one of the key tools used by the Fed to regulate the money supply and influence economic activity. The Federal Discount Rate is typically higher than the federal funds rate, encouraging banks to seek market-based financing rather than borrowing directly from the Fed.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：联邦贴现率主要用于调节银行体系的流动性。当银行面临短期资金短缺时，可以向美联储申请贷款，但需支付贴现率作为成本。较高的贴现率会抑制银行借款，从而减少货币供应；较低的贴现率则鼓励借款，增加货币供应。应用场景包括应对金融危机、调节通胀或通缩等。需要注意的是，过度依赖贴现窗口可能被视为银行财务状况不佳的信号。  
  **English Explanation**: The Federal Discount Rate is primarily used to regulate liquidity in the banking system. When banks face short-term funding shortages, they can borrow from the Fed at the discount rate. A higher discount rate discourages borrowing, reducing the money supply, while a lower rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply. Applications include addressing financial crises, managing inflation or deflation, and stabilizing the economy. However, excessive reliance on the discount window may signal financial instability in a bank.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：联邦贴现率在货币政策中具有重要地位。它是美联储实施货币政策的核心工具之一，直接影响银行的借贷成本和货币市场的流动性。从监管角度看，贴现率的调整反映了美联储对经济形势的判断；从投资角度看，它影响市场利率和资产价格；从行业角度看，它决定了银行的融资成本和盈利能力。  
  **English Explanation**: The Federal Discount Rate plays a crucial role in monetary policy. It is one of the Fed's primary tools for implementing monetary policy, directly influencing banks' borrowing costs and liquidity in the money market. From a regulatory perspective, adjustments to the discount rate reflect the Fed's assessment of economic conditions. From an investment perspective, it affects market interest rates and asset prices. From an industry perspective, it determines banks' funding costs and profitability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：联邦贴现率的起源可以追溯到1913年《联邦储备法》的通过，该法案确立了美联储作为美国中央银行的地位。最初，贴现率被设计为帮助银行应对流动性危机，确保金融体系的稳定。20世纪30年代大萧条期间，美联储通过调整贴现率来应对经济衰退。此后，贴现率逐渐成为美联储调控经济的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**: The Federal Discount Rate originated with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, which established the Fed as the central bank of the United States. Initially, the discount rate was designed to help banks manage liquidity crises and ensure financial stability. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Fed used adjustments to the discount rate to address economic downturns. Since then, the discount rate has become a key tool for the Fed to regulate the economy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：联邦贴现率对全球金融市场具有深远影响。例如，2008年金融危机期间，美联储大幅降低贴现率以增加流动性，稳定金融市场。目前，贴现率仍是美联储应对经济波动的重要手段。在全球范围内，其他中央银行也借鉴美联储的做法，使用类似工具调控本国经济。  
  **English Explanation**: The Federal Discount Rate has a profound impact on global financial markets. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed significantly lowered the discount rate to increase liquidity and stabilize financial markets.
