## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  Form 1065，即《美国合伙企业收入申报表》，是由美国国税局（IRS）要求合伙企业提交的年度税务申报表。该表格用于报告合伙企业的收入、支出、利润和亏损，并将这些信息分配给各个合伙人。合伙企业本身不缴纳所得税，而是将税务责任传递给合伙人，合伙人根据分配到的收入在其个人税表中申报纳税。

  Form 1065, also known as the U.S. Return of Partnership Income, is an annual tax return form required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for partnerships. This form is used to report the partnership's income, expenses, profits, and losses, and to allocate this information to individual partners. The partnership itself does not pay income tax; instead, the tax liability is passed through to the partners, who report their share of income on their individual tax returns.
