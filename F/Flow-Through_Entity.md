# Flow-Through Entity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  流转实体（Flow-Through Entity）是一种企业结构，其收入和损失直接“流转”至所有者或股东，而不是在实体层面征税。这意味着实体本身不缴纳所得税，而是由所有者或股东在其个人纳税申报表中报告并缴纳相应的税款。常见的流转实体包括合伙企业（Partnerships）、S型公司（S Corporations）和有限责任公司（LLCs）等。  
  **核心概念**：流转实体的核心在于避免“双重征税”，即企业利润仅在个人层面征税，而非企业和个人层面同时征税。

  **English Explanation**:  
  A Flow-Through Entity is a business structure where income and losses are directly "passed through" to the owners or shareholders, rather than being taxed at the entity level. This means the entity itself does not pay income taxes; instead, the owners or shareholders report and pay taxes on their share of the income on their personal tax returns. Common examples include Partnerships, S Corporations, and Limited Liability Companies (LLCs).  
  **Core Concept**: The key idea of a flow-through entity is to avoid "double taxation," where profits are taxed only at the individual level, not at both the corporate and individual levels.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  流转实体广泛应用于中小型企业，尤其是那些希望简化税务结构并避免双重征税的企业。例如，合伙企业通常用于律师事务所、会计师事务所等专业服务机构，而S型公司则常见于小型企业。需要注意的是，流转实体的所有者需承担无限责任（如合伙企业），或需遵守特定的税务规定（如S型公司的股东人数限制）。  
  **风险提示**：流转实体的所有者需确保准确申报收入，并遵守相关税务法规，否则可能面临罚款或审计风险。

  **English Application**:  
  Flow-through entities are widely used by small and medium-sized businesses, particularly those looking to simplify their tax structure and avoid double taxation. For example, partnerships are commonly used in professional service firms like law firms and accounting firms, while S Corporations are popular among small businesses. It is important to note that owners of flow-through entities may face unlimited liability (e.g., in partnerships) or must comply with specific tax regulations (e.g., shareholder limits for S Corporations).  
  **Risk Note**: Owners must ensure accurate income reporting and compliance with tax regulations to avoid penalties or audits.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  流转实体的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的美国税法改革。1913年，美国联邦所得税法正式实施，企业利润和个人收入开始分别征税。为了避免双重征税，1920年代，美国引入了合伙企业免税政策，允许合伙企业将利润直接流转至合伙人。1958年，S型公司（Subchapter S Corporation）的概念被引入，进一步扩展了流转实体的适用范围。  
  **关键人物**：美国国会和财政部在流转实体的立法过程中发挥了重要作用。

  **English Origin**:  
  The concept of flow-through entities dates back to early 20th-century U.S. tax reforms. In 1913, the federal income tax system was established, taxing corporate profits and individual income separately. To avoid double taxation, the U.S. introduced tax-exempt treatment for partnerships in the 1920s, allowing profits to flow directly to partners. In 1958, the concept of S Corporations (Subchapter S Corporations) was introduced, further expanding the scope of flow-through entities.  
  **Key Figures**: The U.S. Congress and Treasury Department played significant roles in the legislative development of flow-through entities.
