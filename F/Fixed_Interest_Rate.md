# Fixed Interest Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：固定利率是指在借贷合同或金融产品中，利率在合同期内保持不变的一种利率形式。无论市场利率如何波动，借款人或投资人都按照合同约定的固定利率支付或收取利息。这一概念最早由银行和金融机构在20世纪初引入，旨在为借贷双方提供利率风险的确定性。  
  **English Explanation**: A fixed interest rate refers to an interest rate that remains constant throughout the term of a loan or financial product. Regardless of market fluctuations, borrowers or investors pay or receive interest at the agreed-upon fixed rate. This concept was introduced by banks and financial institutions in the early 20th century to provide certainty in interest rate risk for both parties.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：固定利率广泛应用于住房抵押贷款、企业债券和政府债券等领域。对于借款人而言，固定利率提供了稳定的还款计划，避免了市场利率上升带来的额外负担；对于投资者而言，固定利率债券提供了可预测的收益。然而，固定利率也可能在市场利率下降时导致机会成本，因为借款人无法享受更低的利率。  
  **English Application**: Fixed interest rates are widely used in mortgages, corporate bonds, and government bonds. For borrowers, fixed rates provide stable repayment plans, avoiding additional burdens from rising market rates. For investors, fixed-rate bonds offer predictable returns. However, fixed rates may also lead to opportunity costs when market rates fall, as borrowers cannot benefit from lower rates.
