# FAS 13

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：FAS 13（财务会计准则第13号）是由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）发布的一项会计准则，专门规范租赁会计的处理方法。该准则的核心概念包括区分融资租赁和经营租赁，并要求企业在财务报表中明确披露租赁资产和负债的相关信息。  
  **English Explanation**: FAS 13 (Financial Accounting Standards No. 13) is an accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that specifically governs the accounting treatment of leases. The core concepts of this standard include distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases, and requiring companies to clearly disclose information related to leased assets and liabilities in their financial statements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：FAS 13广泛应用于企业的租赁活动中，特别是在航空、零售和制造业等行业。企业需要根据租赁合同的性质，判断其属于融资租赁还是经营租赁，并据此进行会计处理。融资租赁通常需要在资产负债表中确认资产和负债，而经营租赁则仅在利润表中反映租金费用。需要注意的是，错误分类可能导致财务报表失真，影响投资者决策。  
  **English Explanation**: FAS 13 is widely applied in corporate leasing activities, especially in industries such as aviation, retail, and manufacturing. Companies need to determine whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease based on the nature of the lease contract and account for it accordingly. Finance leases typically require the recognition of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while operating leases only reflect rental expenses in the income statement. It is important to note that misclassification can lead to distorted financial statements, affecting investor decisions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：FAS 13在财务报告领域具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它提高了租赁活动的透明度，有助于防止企业通过租赁安排隐藏负债。从投资角度看，清晰的租赁信息披露帮助投资者更准确地评估企业的财务状况。从行业角度看，FAS 13推动了租赁市场的规范化发展。  
  **English Explanation**: FAS 13 holds significant importance in the field of financial reporting. From a regulatory perspective, it enhances the transparency of leasing activities, helping to prevent companies from hiding liabilities through lease arrangements. From an investment perspective, clear lease disclosures enable investors to more accurately assess a company's financial health. From an industry perspective, FAS 13 promotes the standardized development of the leasing market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：FAS 13于1976年由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）发布，旨在解决当时租赁会计处理中的不一致问题。在此之前，企业普遍利用租赁安排来规避资产负债表上的负债披露，导致财务报表缺乏可比性。FAS 13的制定过程历时多年，经过多次公开讨论和修订，最终成为租赁会计的权威标准。  
  **English Explanation**: FAS 13 was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 1976 to address inconsistencies in lease accounting practices at the time. Prior to this, companies commonly used lease arrangements to avoid disclosing liabilities on their balance sheets, leading to a lack of comparability in financial statements. The development of FAS 13 took several years, involving multiple public discussions and revisions, ultimately establishing it as the authoritative standard for lease accounting.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：FAS 13的发布对全球租赁行业产生了深远影响。它不仅规范了美国的租赁会计实践，还为其他国家的会计准则制定提供了参考。例如，国际会计准则理事会（IASB）在其租赁准则（IFRS 16）中借鉴了FAS 13的核心理念。目前，FAS 13仍然是租赁会计领域的重要基础，尽管后续准则（如ASC 842）对其进行了更新和补充。  
  **English Explanation**: The release of FAS 13 had a profound impact on the global leasing industry. It not only standardized lease accounting practices in the United States but also served as a reference for the development of accounting standards in other countries. For example, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) drew on the core principles of FAS 13 in its lease standard (IFRS 16). Today, FAS 13 remains a foundational element in lease accounting, although subsequent standards (such as ASC 842) have updated and supplemented it.
