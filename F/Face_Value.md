# Face Value

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  面值（Face Value）是指金融工具（如债券、股票或票据）上标明的名义价值。它是发行时确定的固定金额，通常用于计算利息或股息。面值并不一定等于市场价值，市场价值会随着市场供需关系波动。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Face Value refers to the nominal value of a financial instrument (such as a bond, stock, or note) as stated on the instrument itself. It is a fixed amount determined at issuance, typically used to calculate interest or dividends. Face Value does not necessarily equal market value, which fluctuates based on supply and demand.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  面值在债券市场中尤为重要，债券的利息通常基于面值计算。例如，一张面值为1000元的债券，年利率为5%，则每年支付50元利息。此外，股票的面值在发行时确定，但实际交易价格可能远高于或低于面值。投资者需注意，面值并不反映市场价值，投资决策应结合市场情况。  
  **English Application**  
  Face Value is particularly important in the bond market, where interest payments are typically calculated based on the face value. For example, a bond with a face value of $1,000 and an annual interest rate of 5% will pay $50 in interest each year. Additionally, the face value of stocks is determined at issuance, but the actual trading price may be significantly higher or lower than the face value. Investors should note that face value does not reflect market value, and investment decisions should consider market conditions.
