## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  远期外汇合约（Forward Exchange Contract）是一种金融衍生工具，由交易双方约定在未来某一特定日期以预先确定的汇率进行外汇买卖的合约。其核心概念包括锁定汇率、规避汇率风险以及满足未来外汇需求。该工具最早由银行和金融机构为国际贸易企业设计，用于对冲汇率波动带来的不确定性。  

  **English Explanation**  
  A Forward Exchange Contract is a financial derivative instrument where two parties agree to buy or sell a specified amount of a foreign currency at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. Key concepts include locking in an exchange rate, hedging against currency risk, and meeting future foreign exchange needs. This tool was initially designed by banks and financial institutions for international trade businesses to mitigate uncertainties caused by exchange rate fluctuations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  远期外汇合约广泛应用于国际贸易、跨境投资和外汇风险管理领域。例如，一家中国进口商预计三个月后需要支付美元货款，可以通过签订远期外汇合约锁定汇率，避免因人民币贬值导致的成本上升。需要注意的是，远期外汇合约具有法律约束力，一旦签订，双方必须履约，且可能面临市场汇率与合约汇率差异带来的潜在损失。  

  **English Application**  
  Forward Exchange Contracts are widely used in international trade, cross-border investments, and foreign exchange risk management. For instance, a Chinese importer expecting to pay for goods in USD three months later can lock in the exchange rate through a forward contract to avoid increased costs due to RMB depreciation. It is important to note that forward contracts are legally binding, and both parties must fulfill the agreement, potentially facing losses if the market rate differs from the contract rate.

With the collapse of the gold standard and the rise of floating exchange rates, businesses faced greater currency risk.
