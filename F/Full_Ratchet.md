# Full Ratchet

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Full Ratchet（完全棘轮条款）是一种反稀释保护机制，主要用于风险投资和私募股权投资中。当公司以低于之前融资轮次的价格发行新股时，该条款允许早期投资者以新的较低价格调整其持股比例，从而保护其投资价值不被稀释。这一条款通常由初创企业的早期投资者提出，以确保他们在后续融资中不会因股价下跌而遭受损失。  
  **English Explanation**: Full Ratchet is an anti-dilution protection mechanism primarily used in venture capital and private equity investments. When a company issues new shares at a price lower than that of a previous financing round, this clause allows early investors to adjust their shareholding ratio at the new lower price, thereby protecting their investment value from dilution. This provision is typically proposed by early-stage investors in startups to ensure they do not suffer losses due to share price declines in subsequent financing rounds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Full Ratchet条款常见于初创企业的早期融资阶段，尤其是在市场不确定性较高或公司估值可能大幅波动的情况下。投资者通过这一条款确保其持股比例不会因公司估值下降而被稀释。然而，对于公司创始人和其他股东而言，这一条款可能带来较大的股权稀释风险，因此在谈判中需谨慎权衡。  
  **English Application**: The Full Ratchet clause is commonly seen in the early financing stages of startups, especially in situations with high market uncertainty or significant fluctuations in company valuation. Investors use this clause to ensure their shareholding ratio is not diluted due to a decline in company valuation. However, for company founders and other shareholders, this clause may pose significant equity dilution risks, requiring careful negotiation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从投资角度来看，Full Ratchet条款为早期投资者提供了强有力的保护，增强了其投资信心。从监管角度来看，这一条款的广泛使用可能影响初创企业的融资环境，增加创始团队的融资难度。从行业角度来看，Full Ratchet条款的合理运用有助于平衡投资者与创始人之间的利益，但过度使用可能抑制创新企业的成长。  
  **English Significance**: From an investment perspective, the Full Ratchet clause provides strong protection for early investors, boosting their confidence. From a regulatory standpoint, the widespread use of this clause may impact the financing environment for startups, increasing the difficulty for founding teams to raise funds. From an industry perspective, the appropriate use of the Full Ratchet clause helps balance the interests between investors and founders, but excessive use may hinder the growth of innovative companies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：Full Ratchet条款最早出现在20世纪中期的美国风险投资领域。当时，初创企业的高失败率和估值波动使得投资者迫切需要一种机制来保护其投资。随着硅谷科技创业浪潮的兴起，这一条款逐渐成为风险投资协议中的标准条款之一。  
  **English Origin**: The Full Ratchet clause first emerged in the mid-20th century in the U.S. venture capital sector. At that time, the high failure rate and valuation volatility of startups necessitated a mechanism to protect investors' interests. With the rise of the tech startup wave in Silicon Valley, this clause gradually became a standard provision in venture capital agreements.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：Full Ratchet条款的引入对初创企业融资环境产生了深远影响。一方面，它增强了投资者对早期项目的信心，促进了风险投资行业的发展；另一方面，它也可能导致创始团队在后续融资中面临更大的股权稀释压力，甚至影响公司的长期发展战略。目前，这一条款在全球化投资中仍被广泛使用，但其具体应用因地区和行业而异。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of the Full Ratchet clause has had a profound impact on the financing environment for startups. On one hand, it has boosted investor confidence in early-stage projects, fostering the growth of the venture capital industry. On the other hand, it may also lead to greater equity dilution pressure for founding teams in subsequent financing rounds, potentially affecting the company's long-term development strategy. Currently, this clause remains widely used in global investments, but its specific application varies by region and industry.
