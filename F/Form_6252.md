  **English Explanation**: Form 6252, also known as the "Installment Sale Income Tax Form," is a tax form required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who engage in installment sales. This form is used to report income received from the sale of assets through installment payments and to calculate the corresponding income tax liability. An installment sale occurs when the seller allows the buyer to pay for the asset over a period of time, rather than in a single lump sum.
