# Free-Float Methodology

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：自由流通市值法（Free-Float Methodology）是一种用于计算股票指数的方法，其核心在于仅考虑公司股票中可自由流通的部分，而非总股本。自由流通股是指那些不受限制、可以在公开市场上自由交易的股票，不包括由公司内部人员、政府或其他长期持有者控制的股份。这种方法由全球主要指数编制机构（如MSCI、富时罗素等）广泛采用，旨在更准确地反映市场的真实交易情况。  
  **English Explanation**: The Free-Float Methodology is a method used to calculate stock indices, focusing only on the freely tradable portion of a company's shares rather than the total shares outstanding. Free-float shares refer to those that are not restricted and can be freely traded in the open market, excluding shares held by insiders, governments, or other long-term holders. This method is widely adopted by major index providers (e.g., MSCI, FTSE Russell) to more accurately reflect the true trading dynamics of the market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：自由流通市值法广泛应用于全球主要股票指数的编制，如MSCI全球指数、标普500指数等。它适用于评估市场的流动性和投资机会，尤其对机构投资者和指数基金具有重要意义。然而，该方法也存在一定风险，例如自由流通股的变动可能导致指数权重调整，进而影响市场波动。  
  **English Explanation**: The Free-Float Methodology is widely used in the compilation of major global stock indices, such as the MSCI World Index and the S&P 500. It is suitable for assessing market liquidity and investment opportunities, particularly for institutional investors and index funds. However, this method also carries risks, such as changes in free-float shares potentially leading to index weight adjustments and subsequent market volatility.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，自由流通市值法有助于提高市场透明度和公平性；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更准确的市场参考；从行业角度看，该方法推动了指数基金和ETF等被动投资工具的发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the Free-Float Methodology enhances market transparency and fairness; from an investment perspective, it provides investors with more accurate market benchmarks; from an industry perspective, it promotes the development of passive investment tools such as index funds and ETFs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：自由流通市值法的概念起源于20世纪90年代，随着全球资本市场的开放和机构投资者的崛起，传统的总市值法逐渐暴露出其局限性。1998年，MSCI率先在其全球指数中采用自由流通市值法，随后富时罗素和标普等机构也纷纷跟进。这一方法的提出旨在更真实地反映市场的可投资性和流动性。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the Free-Float Methodology originated in the 1990s, as the limitations of the traditional full-market capitalization method became apparent with the opening of global capital markets and the rise of institutional investors. In 1998, MSCI pioneered the use of this methodology in its global indices, followed by FTSE Russell and S&P. The method was introduced to more accurately reflect the investability and liquidity of the market.
