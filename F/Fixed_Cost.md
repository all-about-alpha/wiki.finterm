# Fixed Cost

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：固定成本（Fixed Cost）是指在一定时期内，不随生产量或销售量的变化而变化的成本。这类成本通常包括租金、折旧、管理人员工资等，无论企业生产多少产品或服务，这些成本都保持不变。固定成本的概念最早由经济学家在成本分析中提出，用于区分与变动成本的不同。  
  **English Explanation**: Fixed Cost refers to expenses that do not change with the level of production or sales over a certain period. These costs typically include rent, depreciation, and salaries of management personnel. Regardless of how much a company produces or sells, these costs remain constant. The concept of fixed cost was first introduced by economists in cost analysis to distinguish it from variable costs.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：固定成本在企业经营中广泛应用于成本控制和预算编制。例如，制造业企业在制定生产计划时，需考虑厂房租金和设备折旧等固定成本，以确保在低产量时仍能覆盖这些支出。需要注意的是，固定成本虽然不随产量变化，但在长期中可能因合同到期或设备更新而发生变化。  
  **English Application**: Fixed costs are widely used in business operations for cost control and budgeting. For instance, manufacturing companies must consider fixed costs such as factory rent and equipment depreciation when planning production to ensure these expenses are covered even at low production levels. It is important to note that while fixed costs do not vary with production, they may change in the long term due to contract expirations or equipment upgrades.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，固定成本是企业财务健康的重要指标。高固定成本可能增加企业的经营风险，尤其是在市场需求波动时。投资者在评估企业时，会关注固定成本占比，以判断企业的盈利能力和抗风险能力。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, fixed costs are a critical indicator of a company's financial health. High fixed costs can increase operational risks, especially during market demand fluctuations. Investors pay close attention to the proportion of fixed costs when evaluating a company to assess its profitability and risk resilience.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：固定成本的概念最早可追溯到18世纪的经济学理论。亚当·斯密（Adam Smith）在其著作《国富论》中初步探讨了生产成本的结构，但固定成本的明确区分是在19世纪末由阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）等经济学家完成的。马歇尔在其《经济学原理》中系统分析了固定成本与变动成本的区别，为现代成本管理奠定了基础。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of fixed costs can be traced back to 18th-century economic theories. Adam Smith, in his work *The Wealth of Nations*, initially explored the structure of production costs, but the clear distinction of fixed costs was formalized in the late 19th century by economists such as Alfred Marshall. In his *Principles of Economics*, Marshall systematically analyzed the difference between fixed and variable costs, laying the foundation for modern cost management.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：固定成本的概念对现代企业管理产生了深远影响。它帮助企业更好地进行成本分摊和定价决策，尤其是在制造业和服务业中。如今，固定成本分析已成为企业财务管理和战略规划的核心工具之一。  
  **English Impact**: The concept of fixed costs has had a profound impact on modern business management. It helps companies better allocate costs and make pricing decisions, particularly in manufacturing and service industries.
