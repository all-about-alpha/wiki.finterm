# Full Costing

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  完全成本法（Full Costing），又称吸收成本法（Absorption Costing），是一种将所有生产成本（包括固定成本和变动成本）都计入产品成本的计算方法。这种方法由美国会计学界在20世纪初期提出，核心概念是将直接材料、直接人工、制造费用（包括固定制造费用）全部纳入产品成本核算中。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Full Costing, also known as Absorption Costing, is a method of accounting that includes all manufacturing costs (both fixed and variable) in the cost of a product. This method was developed by American accounting scholars in the early 20th century. The core concept is to allocate direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead (including fixed manufacturing overhead) into the product cost.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  完全成本法广泛应用于制造业和服务业，特别是在需要全面反映产品成本以支持定价决策、财务报表编制和税务申报的场景中。需要注意的是，这种方法可能导致短期内利润波动，因为固定成本的分摊会影响单位产品成本。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Full Costing is widely used in manufacturing and service industries, particularly in scenarios where a comprehensive reflection of product costs is needed to support pricing decisions, financial reporting, and tax filings. It is important to note that this method may lead to short-term profit fluctuations because the allocation of fixed costs affects the unit product cost.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**  
  从监管角度看，完全成本法是许多国家会计准则（如中国会计准则和国际财务报告准则）认可的成本核算方法，有助于提高财务报表的透明度和可比性。从投资和行业角度看，它为企业提供了更全面的成本信息，支持战略决策和绩效评估。  
  **English Explanation**  
  From a regulatory perspective, Full Costing is recognized by many accounting standards (such as Chinese Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards) and helps improve the transparency and comparability of financial statements. From an investment and industry perspective, it provides businesses with comprehensive cost information, supporting strategic decision-making and performance evaluation.
