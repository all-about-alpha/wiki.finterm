# Federal Housing Administration (FHA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  联邦住房管理局（FHA）是美国政府机构，成立于1934年，隶属于美国住房和城市发展部（HUD）。其主要职责是为中低收入家庭提供住房贷款保险，降低贷款机构的风险，从而促进住房市场的稳定和发展。FHA并不直接发放贷款，而是通过为符合条件的贷款提供保险，帮助借款人获得更低的利率和更宽松的贷款条件。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a U.S. government agency established in 1934 under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Its primary role is to provide mortgage insurance for low- to moderate-income families, reducing the risk for lenders and thereby promoting stability and growth in the housing market. The FHA does not directly issue loans but insures eligible loans, enabling borrowers to secure lower interest rates and more flexible loan terms.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  FHA贷款广泛应用于首次购房者、信用记录不佳或收入较低的借款人。其特点是首付比例低（最低可至3.5%），且对信用评分要求较为宽松。然而，借款人需支付额外的抵押贷款保险费（MIP），这增加了贷款的总成本。FHA贷款适用于购买自住房，不适用于投资性房产。  
  **English Application**  
  FHA loans are widely used by first-time homebuyers, borrowers with poor credit histories, or those with lower incomes. Key features include low down payment requirements (as low as 3.5%) and more lenient credit score criteria. However, borrowers are required to pay an additional Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP), which increases the overall cost of the loan. FHA loans are intended for primary residences and are not available for investment properties.
