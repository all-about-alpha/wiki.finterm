# FAS 157

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  FAS 157，全称为《财务会计准则第157号：公允价值计量》（Financial Accounting Standards No. 157: Fair Value Measurements），由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）于2006年发布。该准则明确了公允价值的定义，并建立了统一的公允价值计量框架，要求企业在财务报表中披露公允价值计量的方法和假设。  
  FAS 157, officially titled "Financial Accounting Standards No. 157: Fair Value Measurements," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 2006. This standard defines fair value and establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, requiring companies to disclose the methods and assumptions used in fair value measurements in their financial statements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，FAS 157的应用主要体现在跨国企业的财务报表编制中，尤其是那些在美国上市或与美国企业有业务往来的公司。这些企业需要遵循FAS 157的规定，确保其资产和负债的公允价值计量符合国际标准。需要注意的是，公允价值计量可能受到市场波动的影响，导致财务报表的波动性增加。  
  In China, the application of FAS 157 is primarily seen in the financial reporting of multinational corporations, especially those listed in the U.S. or conducting business with American companies. These companies must comply with FAS 157 to ensure that the fair value measurements of their assets and liabilities meet international standards. It is important to note that fair value measurements can be affected by market volatility, potentially increasing the volatility of financial statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，FAS 157提高了财务信息的透明度和可比性，有助于投资者更好地评估企业的财务状况。从投资角度看，公允价值计量为投资者提供了更准确的资产和负债估值信息。从行业角度看，FAS 157推动了全球财务报告标准的统一，促进了国际资本市场的融合。  
  From a regulatory perspective, FAS 157 enhances the transparency and comparability of financial information, helping investors better assess a company's financial health. From an investment perspective, fair value measurements provide investors with more accurate valuations of assets and liabilities. From an industry perspective, FAS 157 promotes the harmonization of global financial reporting standards and facilitates the integration of international capital markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  FAS 157的制定背景源于2000年代初期的财务丑闻（如安然事件），这些事件暴露了传统历史成本会计的局限性。FASB于2004年启动公允价值计量项目，经过两年的研究和讨论，于2006年9月正式发布FAS 157。该准则的发布标志着公允价值计量在财务报告中的重要地位得到正式确立。  
  The development of FAS 157 was driven by the financial scandals of the early 2000s (e.g., Enron), which highlighted the limitations of traditional historical cost accounting. FASB initiated the fair value measurement project in 2004, and after two years of research and discussion, officially issued FAS 157 in September 2006. The release of this standard marked the formal recognition of the importance of fair value measurements in financial reporting.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  FAS 157的发布对全球财务报告产生了深远影响。在中国，随着越来越多的企业走向国际化，FAS 157的应用逐渐普及，尤其是在金融行业。然而，2008年金融危机期间，公允价值计量被批评为加剧了市场波动，导致FASB对部分条款进行了修订。目前，FAS 157仍是全球财务报告的重要参考标准之一。  
  The release of FAS 157 had a profound impact on global financial reporting. In China, as more companies internationalize, the application of FAS 157 has become increasingly widespread, particularly in the financial sector. However, during the 2008 financial crisis, fair value measurements were criticized for exacerbating market volatility, leading FASB to revise certain provisions. Today, FAS 157 remains one of the key reference standards for global financial reporting.
