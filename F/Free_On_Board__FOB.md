# Free On Board (FOB)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    “Free On Board”（FOB，装运港船上交货）是国际贸易中常用的贸易术语之一，属于国际商会（ICC）制定的《国际贸易术语解释通则》（Incoterms）的一部分。FOB 指卖方在指定装运港将货物装上买方指定的船只后，即完成交货义务。货物的风险在装船后从卖方转移至买方，买方承担从装运港到目的地的所有费用和风险。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    "Free On Board" (FOB) is a widely used trade term in international commerce, part of the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) Incoterms rules. FOB means that the seller fulfills their delivery obligation by placing the goods on board the vessel designated by the buyer at the specified port of shipment. The risk of loss or damage to the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer once the goods are loaded onto the vessel, and the buyer bears all costs and risks from the port of shipment to the destination.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    FOB 常用于海运贸易，特别是当买卖双方希望明确划分责任和风险时。卖方负责将货物运至装运港并承担装船前的所有费用和风险，买方则负责租船订舱、支付运费及保险费，并承担货物装船后的所有风险。需要注意的是，FOB 术语下，卖方需提供清洁提单，而买方需及时安排运输工具以避免滞期费。  
  - **English Application**  
    FOB is commonly used in maritime trade, particularly when buyers and sellers aim to clearly delineate responsibilities and risks. The seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the port of shipment and covering all costs and risks until the goods are loaded onto the vessel. The buyer is responsible for chartering the vessel, paying freight and insurance costs, and bearing all risks after the goods are loaded. It is important to note that under FOB terms, the seller must provide a clean bill of lading, and the buyer must arrange transportation promptly to avoid demurrage charges.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    FOB 是国际贸易中最重要的贸易术语之一，因其明确划分了买卖双方的责任和风险，减少了交易纠纷。从监管角度看，FOB 条款有助于海关和税务部门确定货物的完税价格。从投资和行业角度看，FOB 为买卖双方提供了清晰的成本分摊框架，有助于优化供应链管理和降低交易成本。  
  - **English Significance**  
    FOB is one of the most important trade terms in international commerce, as it clearly defines the responsibilities and risks of buyers and sellers, reducing transaction disputes. From a regulatory perspective, FOB terms help customs and tax authorities determine the dutiable value of goods. From an investment and industry standpoint, FOB provides a clear cost-sharing framework for buyers and sellers, facilitating optimized supply chain management and reduced transaction costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    FOB 的起源可以追溯到19世纪的海上贸易。随着国际贸易的兴起，买卖双方需要一种标准化的术语来明确交货条件和风险划分。1936年，国际商会首次发布《国际贸易术语解释通则》（Incoterms），将 FOB 纳入其中，并经过多次修订以适应现代贸易需求。FOB 的核心概念源于英国商法中的“装船交货”原则。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The origin of FOB dates back to 19th-century maritime trade. As international trade expanded, buyers and sellers needed standardized terms to clarify delivery conditions and risk allocation. In 1936, the International Chamber of Commerce first published the Incoterms rules, including FOB, which have since been revised multiple times to meet modern trade needs. The core concept of FOB stems from the "delivery on board" principle in British commercial law.

  - **English Impact**  
    FOB has had a profound impact on global trade, particularly in maritime shipping. It has streamlined international trade processes, reduced transaction costs, and become a standard clause in international trade contracts.
