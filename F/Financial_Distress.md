  **中文解释**：财务困境（Financial Distress）是指企业或个人因现金流不足或债务负担过重，无法按时履行财务义务（如偿还债务、支付利息等）的状态。这一概念最早由经济学家在研究企业破产风险时提出，核心在于流动性危机和偿债能力的丧失。  
  **English Explanation**: Financial distress refers to a situation where a company or individual is unable to meet financial obligations (such as debt repayment or interest payments) due to insufficient cash flow or excessive debt burden. This concept was initially introduced by economists studying bankruptcy risks, with its core focus on liquidity crises and the loss of solvency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：财务困境常见于高负债企业、经济衰退期或行业下行周期。例如，房地产企业在市场低迷时可能因销售回款困难而陷入财务困境。风险提示：财务困境可能导致企业破产清算、资产重组或债务违约，投资者需关注企业的偿债能力和现金流状况。  
  **English Explanation**: Financial distress is commonly observed in highly leveraged companies, during economic recessions, or in industry downturns. For instance, real estate companies may face financial distress during market slumps due to difficulties in sales collections.
