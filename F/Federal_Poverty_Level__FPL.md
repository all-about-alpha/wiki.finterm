# Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：联邦贫困线（Federal Poverty Level, FPL）是美国政府设定的用于衡量家庭或个人经济状况的标准，主要用于确定是否有资格获得政府援助计划（如医疗补助、食品券等）。该标准由美国卫生与公众服务部（HHS）每年更新，基于家庭规模、收入和消费价格指数（CPI）等因素计算得出。  
  **English Explanation**: The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is a measure established by the U.S. government to assess the economic status of individuals or families, primarily used to determine eligibility for government assistance programs such as Medicaid, SNAP (food stamps), and others. It is updated annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based on factors like household size, income, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：FPL广泛应用于美国的社会福利和医疗补助计划中。例如，家庭收入低于FPL一定比例（如138%）可能有资格获得医疗补助（Medicaid）。此外，FPL也用于确定税收抵免、住房补贴等福利的资格。需要注意的是，FPL并未考虑地区生活成本的差异，因此在某些高成本地区可能无法准确反映实际贫困状况。  
  **English Explanation**: The FPL is widely used in U.S. social welfare and healthcare programs. For instance, families with incomes below a certain percentage of the FPL (e.g., 138%) may qualify for Medicaid. It is also used to determine eligibility for tax credits, housing subsidies, and other benefits. However, the FPL does not account for regional cost-of-living differences, which may limit its accuracy in high-cost areas.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：FPL在政策制定和社会资源分配中具有重要作用。它为政府提供了衡量贫困的标准化工具，帮助决策者识别需要援助的群体。从投资和行业角度来看，FPL的变化可能影响医疗、保险和消费品行业的市场需求。例如，FPL的调整可能扩大或缩小医疗补助的覆盖范围，从而影响医疗服务的供需。  
  **English Explanation**: The FPL plays a critical role in policy-making and resource allocation. It provides a standardized tool for measuring poverty, helping policymakers identify populations in need of assistance. From an investment and industry perspective, changes in the FPL can impact market demand in sectors like healthcare, insurance, and consumer goods. For example, adjustments to the FPL may expand or reduce Medicaid coverage, affecting the supply and demand for healthcare services.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：FPL的起源可以追溯到20世纪60年代，当时美国政府开始系统性地衡量贫困问题。1965年，美国经济学家莫莉·奥珊斯基（Mollie Orshansky）基于家庭食品支出比例提出了最初的贫困线计算方法。这一方法后来被美国政府采纳，并逐步演变为今天的FPL标准。  
  **English Explanation**: The FPL traces its origins to the 1960s when the U.S. government began systematically measuring poverty. In 1965, economist Mollie Orshansky developed the initial poverty threshold based on the proportion of household income spent on food. This method was later adopted by the U.S. government and evolved into the current FPL standard.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：FPL的设立对美国社会福利体系产生了深远影响。它不仅帮助政府识别贫困人口，还为各类援助计划提供了量化依据。然而，FPL的计算方法也受到批评，尤其是其未能充分考虑地区生活成本差异和现代家庭支出结构的变化。尽管如此，FPL仍然是美国社会福利政策的核心工具之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The establishment of the FPL has had a profound impact on the U.S. social welfare system. It has helped the government identify impoverished populations and provided a quantitative basis for various assistance programs. However, the FPL's methodology has faced criticism, particularly for not adequately accounting for regional cost-of-living differences and changes in modern household spending patterns. Despite this, the FPL remains a cornerstone of U.S. social welfare policy.
