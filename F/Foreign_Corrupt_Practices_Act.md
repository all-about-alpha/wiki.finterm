  **English Explanation**  
  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a United States law passed in 1977 that prohibits U.S. companies and individuals from bribing foreign officials to obtain business advantages. The Act is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and it encompasses two main components: accounting transparency and anti-bribery provisions.

  FCPA适用于所有在美国注册的公司、在美国上市的外国公司以及在美国境内开展业务的个人。其应用场景包括跨国并购、海外投资、供应链管理等。企业需建立合规体系，避免因贿赂行为面临高额罚款或声誉损失。  
  **English Application**  
  The FCPA applies to all companies registered in the U.S., foreign companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges, and individuals conducting business within the U.S. Its application scenarios include cross-border mergers and acquisitions, overseas investments, and supply chain management. Companies must establish compliance systems to avoid hefty fines or reputational damage due to bribery.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  FCPA的制定源于20世纪70年代美国企业海外贿赂丑闻的曝光，尤其是洛克希德公司贿赂日本官员的事件。1977年，美国国会通过该法案，成为全球首个明确禁止海外贿赂的法律。  
  **English Origin**  
  The FCPA was enacted in response to the exposure of overseas bribery scandals involving U.S. companies in the 1970s, most notably the Lockheed bribery case in Japan. In 1977, the U.S. Congress passed the Act, making it the first law in the world to explicitly prohibit foreign bribery.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  FCPA的实施对全球反腐败运动产生了深远影响，推动了《联合国反腐败公约》等国际条约的制定。目前，FCPA已成为跨国企业合规管理的重要参考标准，许多国家也借鉴其框架制定了类似法律。  
  **English Impact**  
  The implementation of the FCPA has had a profound impact on the global anti-corruption movement, contributing to the development of international treaties such as the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Today, the FCPA serves as a critical benchmark for compliance management in multinational corporations, and many countries have adopted similar laws based on its framework.
