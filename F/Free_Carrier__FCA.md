# Free Carrier (FCA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    “Free Carrier (FCA)” 是国际贸易术语解释通则（Incoterms）中的一种交货条件，指卖方在指定地点将货物交给买方指定的承运人即完成交货义务。卖方负责将货物运至指定地点并承担此前的所有费用和风险，而买方则承担从该地点起的运输费用和风险。FCA适用于任何运输方式，包括多式联运。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    "Free Carrier (FCA)" is a term in the International Commercial Terms (Incoterms) that indicates the seller fulfills their delivery obligation by handing over the goods to the carrier nominated by the buyer at a specified location. The seller is responsible for transporting the goods to the designated place and bears all costs and risks up to that point, while the buyer assumes the costs and risks from that location onward. FCA is applicable to any mode of transport, including multimodal transport.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    FCA常用于国际贸易中，特别是当买方希望自行安排运输或使用自己的承运人时。例如，买方可能希望使用其长期合作的物流公司，或者需要将货物运至特定港口或仓库。使用FCA时，卖方需确保货物在指定地点安全交付给承运人，而买方需及时安排运输工具以避免延误。需要注意的是，买卖双方应明确指定交货地点，以避免争议。  
  - **English Application**  
    FCA is commonly used in international trade, especially when the buyer prefers to arrange transportation or use their own carrier. For example, the buyer may wish to use a logistics company they have a long-term relationship with or need to transport goods to a specific port or warehouse. When using FCA, the seller must ensure the goods are safely delivered to the carrier at the specified location, while the buyer must arrange transportation promptly to avoid delays. It is crucial for both parties to clearly define the delivery location to prevent disputes.
