# Fair Value Accounting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：公允价值会计是一种会计方法，要求企业根据市场条件或估值技术，以公允价值计量资产和负债。公允价值是指在公平交易中，熟悉情况的交易双方自愿进行资产交换或负债清偿的金额。这一概念最早由国际会计准则理事会（IASB）和美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）提出，旨在提高财务报告的透明度和可比性。  
  **English Explanation**: Fair Value Accounting is an accounting method that requires companies to measure assets and liabilities at their fair value based on market conditions or valuation techniques. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This concept was introduced by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial reporting.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：公允价值会计广泛应用于金融工具、投资性房地产、企业合并等场景。例如，在金融工具的公允价值计量中，企业需根据市场价格或估值模型确定其价值。然而，公允价值会计的应用也面临挑战，如市场波动可能导致资产价值大幅波动，进而影响财务报表的稳定性。  
  **English Explanation**: Fair Value Accounting is widely applied in scenarios such as financial instruments, investment properties, and business combinations. For instance, in the fair value measurement of financial instruments, companies need to determine their value based on market prices or valuation models. However, the application of Fair Value Accounting also faces challenges, such as market volatility potentially causing significant fluctuations in asset values, thereby affecting the stability of financial statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，公允价值会计有助于提高财务信息的透明度，使投资者能够更准确地评估企业的财务状况。从投资角度看，公允价值会计提供了更及时的市场信息，帮助投资者做出更明智的决策。从行业角度看，公允价值会计推动了全球会计准则的统一，促进了国际资本市场的融合。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Fair Value Accounting helps enhance the transparency of financial information, enabling investors to more accurately assess a company's financial condition. From an investment perspective, it provides more timely market information, aiding investors in making more informed decisions. From an industry perspective, Fair Value Accounting promotes the harmonization of global accounting standards and facilitates the integration of international capital markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：公允价值会计的起源可以追溯到20世纪80年代的美国，当时金融市场快速发展，传统的历史成本会计无法准确反映金融工具的市场价值。1993年，FASB发布了第115号财务会计准则（FAS 115），首次要求在财务报表中披露金融工具的公允价值。2006年，IASB发布了《国际财务报告准则第13号》（IFRS 13），进一步规范了公允价值的定义和应用。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of Fair Value Accounting can be traced back to the 1980s in the United States, when the rapid development of financial markets made traditional historical cost accounting inadequate for reflecting the market value of financial instruments. In 1993, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (FAS 115), which for the first time required the disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments in financial statements. In 2006, the IASB issued International Financial Reporting Standard 13 (IFRS 13), further standardizing the definition and application of fair value.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：公允价值会计的引入对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。它提高了财务信息的透明度，但也加剧了市场波动性，特别是在金融危机期间。目前，公允价值会计已成为全球主要会计准则的重要组成部分，广泛应用于上市公司和金融机构的财务报告中。  
  **English Explanation**: The introduction of Fair Value Accounting has had a profound impact on global financial markets. It has enhanced the transparency of financial information but also increased market volatility, particularly during financial crises. Currently, Fair Value Accounting has become an integral part of major global accounting standards and is widely applied in the financial reporting of listed companies and financial institutions.
