## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：FmHA的前身可以追溯到1930年代大萧条时期的“农村电气化管理局”（REA）和“农场安全管理局”（FSA）。1946年，美国国会通过《农民家庭管理局法案》，正式成立FmHA，旨在整合农村金融支持资源，帮助战后农村经济复苏。其成立背景是当时美国农村地区普遍存在的贫困和基础设施落后问题。  
  - **English Origin**: The FmHA's origins trace back to the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) and the Farm Security Administration (FSA) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1946, the U.S. Congress passed the Farmers Home Administration Act, formally establishing the FmHA to consolidate rural financial support resources and aid post-war rural economic recovery. Its establishment was driven by widespread poverty and inadequate infrastructure in rural America at the time.
