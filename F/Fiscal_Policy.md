## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**  
  财政政策的概念可以追溯到20世纪初，特别是凯恩斯在1930年代提出的经济理论。凯恩斯认为，在经济衰退时，政府应通过增加公共支出和减税来刺激需求，从而恢复经济增长。这一理论在二战后被广泛采纳，成为现代财政政策的基础。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The concept of fiscal policy dates back to the early 20th century, particularly with the economic theories proposed by Keynes in the 1930s. Keynes argued that during economic recessions, governments should stimulate demand through increased public spending and tax cuts to restore economic growth. This theory was widely adopted after World War II and forms the basis of modern fiscal policy.
