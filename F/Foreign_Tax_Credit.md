# Foreign Tax Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：外国税收抵免（Foreign Tax Credit）是指纳税人在境外缴纳的所得税可以在本国应纳税额中抵免的一种税收优惠政策。其核心概念是避免双重征税，即纳税人在境外取得的收入已在境外缴纳所得税后，不再在本国重复缴纳。这一政策通常由各国税法规定，旨在促进跨国投资和贸易。  
  **English Explanation**: A Foreign Tax Credit is a tax incentive that allows taxpayers to offset taxes paid to foreign governments against their domestic tax liabilities. The core concept is to avoid double taxation, ensuring that income earned abroad and already taxed in a foreign country is not taxed again domestically. This policy is typically governed by national tax laws and aims to promote cross-border investment and trade.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：外国税收抵免主要应用于跨国企业或个人在境外取得收入并已在当地缴纳税款的情况。例如，一家中国企业在海外设立子公司并盈利，若已在当地缴纳所得税，则在中国申报时可申请抵免已缴税款。需要注意的是，抵免额度通常以本国税法规定的限额为准，超出部分可能无法抵免。此外，不同国家的税收协定也会影响抵免的具体操作。  
  **English Explanation**: The Foreign Tax Credit is primarily applied when multinational corporations or individuals earn income abroad and have already paid taxes in the foreign jurisdiction. For example, if a Chinese company establishes a subsidiary overseas and generates profits, it can claim a credit for taxes paid abroad when filing taxes in China. It is important to note that the credit is usually limited to the amount specified by domestic tax laws, and any excess may not be eligible for credit. Additionally, tax treaties between countries can influence the specific application of the credit.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，外国税收抵免有助于维护税收公平，避免双重征税对纳税人造成过重负担。从投资角度看，这一政策鼓励企业“走出去”，参与国际竞争，提升全球资源配置效率。从行业角度看，外国税收抵免是国际税收协调的重要工具，有助于减少跨境贸易和投资的税收障碍。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the Foreign Tax Credit helps maintain tax fairness by preventing the undue burden of double taxation on taxpayers. From an investment standpoint, this policy encourages businesses to expand globally, participate in international competition, and improve the efficiency of global resource allocation. From an industry perspective, the Foreign Tax Credit is a crucial tool for international tax coordination, reducing tax barriers to cross-border trade and investment.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：外国税收抵免的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初，随着国际贸易和投资的兴起，双重征税问题逐渐凸显。1921年，美国率先在其税法中引入外国税收抵免制度，成为全球首个实施该政策的国家。此后，其他国家纷纷效仿，并通过双边税收协定进一步规范抵免规则。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the Foreign Tax Credit dates back to the early 20th century, when the rise of international trade and investment highlighted the issue of double taxation. In 1921, the United States became the first country to introduce the Foreign Tax Credit in its tax code. Subsequently, other countries followed suit and further standardized credit rules through bilateral tax treaties.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：外国税收抵免对全球经济和税收体系产生了深远影响。它促进了跨国企业的全球化布局，减少了税收对国际资本流动的阻碍。目前，几乎所有主要经济体都在其税法中规定了外国税收抵免制度，并通过国际组织（如OECD）协调相关规则，以应对全球化带来的税收挑战。  
  **English Explanation**: The Foreign Tax Credit has had a profound impact on the global economy and tax systems.
