# Fractional Share

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    零股（Fractional Share）是指不足一股的股票份额。传统股票交易通常以整股为单位进行买卖，而零股的出现允许投资者购买或持有不足一股的股票。这一概念最早由金融科技公司和在线券商引入，旨在降低投资门槛，使小额投资者也能参与高单价股票的投资。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A fractional share refers to a portion of a stock that is less than one full share. Traditional stock trading typically involves buying and selling whole shares, but fractional shares allow investors to purchase or hold less than a full share. This concept was introduced by fintech companies and online brokers to lower the investment threshold, enabling small investors to participate in high-priced stock investments.

    零股广泛应用于在线投资平台和移动端交易应用，如Robinhood、富途证券等。投资者可以通过零股投资高单价股票（如亚马逊、谷歌），或进行定期定额投资（如每月固定金额购买某只股票）。需要注意的是，零股交易可能面临流动性较低、交易成本较高等风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    Fractional shares are widely used on online investment platforms and mobile trading apps, such as Robinhood and Futu Securities. Investors can use fractional shares to invest in high-priced stocks (e.g., Amazon, Google) or implement dollar-cost averaging strategies (e.g., investing a fixed amount monthly in a specific stock). However, fractional share trading may face risks such as lower liquidity and higher transaction costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

    零股的概念最早可追溯至20世纪末的股息再投资计划（DRIPs），当时一些公司允许股东将股息用于购买零股。然而，零股的普及主要得益于21世纪初金融科技的兴起。2015年，Robinhood率先推出零股交易功能，随后其他在线券商纷纷跟进。

However, the widespread adoption of fractional shares was driven by the rise of fintech in the early 21st century. In 2015, Robinhood pioneered fractional share trading, followed by other online brokers.
