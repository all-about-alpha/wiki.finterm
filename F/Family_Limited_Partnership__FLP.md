# Family Limited Partnership (FLP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：家族有限合伙（Family Limited Partnership, FLP）是一种由家族成员组成的有限合伙企业，通常用于家族财富管理和资产保护。FLP由至少一名普通合伙人（GP）和一名或多名有限合伙人（LP）组成，普通合伙人负责管理合伙企业的日常运营，而有限合伙人则仅以其出资额为限承担有限责任。FLP的核心概念是通过将家族资产集中管理，实现税务优化、资产保护和财富传承。  
  **English Explanation**: A Family Limited Partnership (FLP) is a limited partnership formed by family members, typically used for family wealth management and asset protection. An FLP consists of at least one general partner (GP) and one or more limited partners (LP). The GP manages the day-to-day operations of the partnership, while the LPs have limited liability, meaning their responsibility is restricted to their investment. The core concept of an FLP is to centralize family assets for tax optimization, asset protection, and wealth transfer.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：FLP常用于家族企业的资产整合、遗产规划和税务筹划。通过将家族资产（如房地产、股票、企业股权等）注入FLP，家族成员可以享受税务优惠，同时减少遗产税和赠与税的负担。此外，FLP还能有效隔离资产风险，防止外部债权人追索。然而，FLP的设立和管理需要严格遵守相关法律法规，否则可能面临税务审查或法律纠纷。  
  **English Explanation**: FLPs are commonly used for consolidating family business assets, estate planning, and tax strategies. By transferring family assets (such as real estate, stocks, or business equity) into an FLP, family members can benefit from tax advantages while reducing estate and gift tax liabilities. Additionally, FLPs can effectively isolate asset risks, protecting against claims from external creditors. However, establishing and managing an FLP requires strict compliance with relevant laws and regulations, as non-compliance may lead to tax audits or legal disputes.
