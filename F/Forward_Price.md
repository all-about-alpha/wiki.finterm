# Forward Price

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：远期价格（Forward Price）是指在远期合约中，买卖双方约定的在未来某一特定日期以特定价格买卖标的资产的协议价格。它是基于现货价格、无风险利率、持有成本（如仓储费）以及标的资产的预期收益或损失计算得出的。远期价格的核心概念在于锁定未来交易的价格，以规避市场价格波动的风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The forward price is the agreed-upon price at which a buyer and seller commit to buying or selling an asset on a specified future date, as stipulated in a forward contract. It is calculated based on the spot price, risk-free interest rate, cost of carry (such as storage costs), and the expected yield or loss of the underlying asset. The core concept of the forward price lies in locking in a future transaction price to hedge against market price fluctuations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：远期价格广泛应用于商品、外汇、利率和股票等金融工具的交易中。例如，农产品生产商可以通过远期合约锁定未来销售价格，避免价格下跌的风险；进口商则可以利用外汇远期合约对冲汇率波动的风险。需要注意的是，远期价格并非市场预测，而是基于当前市场条件和无套利原则计算得出的。  
  **English Explanation**: The forward price is widely used in trading financial instruments such as commodities, foreign exchange, interest rates, and stocks. For example, agricultural producers can use forward contracts to lock in future selling prices and avoid the risk of price declines, while importers can use currency forward contracts to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. It is important to note that the forward price is not a market prediction but is calculated based on current market conditions and the principle of no arbitrage.
