# Free Cash Flow (FCF)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：自由现金流（Free Cash Flow, FCF）是指企业在扣除资本支出（如设备购置、厂房建设等）后，剩余的可以自由支配的现金流。它反映了企业在满足日常运营和投资需求后，能够用于偿还债务、支付股息或进行其他自由支配的现金能力。自由现金流的概念最早由美国经济学家迈克尔·詹森（Michael Jensen）在1986年提出，强调其在企业财务健康评估中的重要性。  
  **English Explanation**: Free Cash Flow (FCF) refers to the cash generated by a company after deducting capital expenditures (such as equipment purchases, factory construction, etc.). It represents the cash available for discretionary use, such as debt repayment, dividend distribution, or other investments, after meeting operational and investment needs. The concept of FCF was first introduced by American economist Michael Jensen in 1986, emphasizing its importance in assessing a company's financial health.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：自由现金流广泛应用于企业估值、投资决策和财务分析中。投资者常用自由现金流来评估企业的盈利能力和财务稳定性，尤其是在进行股票估值时。此外，企业管理层也会利用自由现金流来制定分红政策或进行再投资决策。需要注意的是，自由现金流并非越高越好，过高的自由现金流可能意味着企业未能有效利用资金进行扩张或创新。  
  **English Explanation**: Free Cash Flow is widely used in company valuation, investment decision-making, and financial analysis. Investors often use FCF to assess a company's profitability and financial stability, particularly in stock valuation. Additionally, company management may use FCF to formulate dividend policies or make reinvestment decisions. It is important to note that excessively high FCF may indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its funds for expansion or innovation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，自由现金流是衡量企业财务健康状况的重要指标，能够帮助监管机构评估企业的偿债能力和风险水平。从投资角度看，自由现金流是投资者判断企业内在价值的关键依据，尤其是在现金流折现模型（DCF）中。从行业角度看，自由现金流反映了企业的运营效率和资本配置能力，是行业竞争力的重要体现。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Free Cash Flow is a crucial metric for assessing a company's financial health, helping regulators evaluate its debt repayment capacity and risk levels. From an investment perspective, FCF is a key factor in determining a company's intrinsic value, especially in Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models. From an industry perspective, FCF reflects a company's operational efficiency and capital allocation capabilities, serving as an important indicator of industry competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：自由现金流的概念最早由美国经济学家迈克尔·詹森（Michael Jensen）在1986年提出。他在研究企业代理问题时，发现自由现金流能够有效衡量企业管理层对股东利益的关注程度。詹森认为，自由现金流过高的企业可能存在代理问题，即管理层可能将资金用于低效投资而非回报股东。这一理论为后来的企业财务分析和估值方法奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Free Cash Flow was first introduced by American economist Michael Jensen in 1986. While studying corporate agency problems, Jensen discovered that FCF could effectively measure the extent to which management prioritizes shareholder interests. He argued that companies with excessively high FCF might face agency issues, where management could allocate funds to inefficient investments rather than returning value to shareholders. This theory laid the foundation for subsequent corporate financial analysis and valuation methods.
