# Funds From Operations (FFO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    营运资金（Funds From Operations，FFO）是房地产投资信托基金（REITs）和其他房地产相关公司常用的财务指标，用于衡量其运营产生的现金流。FFO的计算通常从净收入开始，加上折旧和摊销费用，再减去出售资产的收益。这一指标由美国国家房地产投资信托协会（NAREIT）于1991年提出，旨在更准确地反映房地产公司的运营绩效，避免传统会计方法对折旧和摊销的过度影响。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Funds From Operations (FFO) is a financial metric commonly used by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other real estate-related companies to measure the cash flow generated from their operations. FFO is typically calculated by starting with net income, adding back depreciation and amortization expenses, and subtracting gains from the sale of assets. This metric was introduced by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) in 1991 to provide a more accurate reflection of the operating performance of real estate companies, avoiding the overemphasis on depreciation and amortization in traditional accounting methods.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    FFO主要用于评估房地产投资信托基金（REITs）的运营效率和现金流生成能力。投资者和分析师使用FFO来比较不同REITs的绩效，并作为分红能力的参考指标。需要注意的是，FFO并未考虑资本支出（如物业维护和升级），因此在评估公司长期财务健康时，还需结合其他指标如调整后营运资金（AFFO）。  
  - **English Application**  
    FFO is primarily used to evaluate the operational efficiency and cash flow generation capabilities of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Investors and analysts use FFO to compare the performance of different REITs and as a reference for dividend-paying capacity. It is important to note that FFO does not account for capital expenditures (such as property maintenance and upgrades), so other metrics like Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) should also be considered when assessing a company's long-term financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管、投资和行业角度来看，FFO是衡量REITs运营绩效的核心指标。监管机构要求REITs披露FFO以提高财务透明度；投资者依赖FFO评估公司的分红能力和增长潜力；行业内部则通过FFO进行横向比较，优化资产配置和运营策略。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, FFO is a core metric for measuring the operating performance of REITs. Regulatory bodies require REITs to disclose FFO to enhance financial transparency; investors rely on FFO to assess a company's dividend-paying capacity and growth potential; and within the industry, FFO is used for benchmarking to optimize asset allocation and operational strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    FFO的概念由美国国家房地产投资信托协会（NAREIT）于1991年提出。当时，传统的会计方法（如净收入）未能充分反映房地产公司的运营现金流，尤其是折旧和摊销对财务报表的扭曲。NAREIT通过引入FFO，旨在为投资者提供更准确的绩效衡量工具。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of FFO was introduced by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) in 1991. At the time, traditional accounting methods (such as net income) failed to adequately reflect the operating cash flow of real estate companies, particularly due to the distortion caused by depreciation and amortization. By introducing FFO, NAREIT aimed to provide investors with a more accurate performance measurement tool.
