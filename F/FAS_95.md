# FAS 95

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  FAS 95，全称为《财务会计准则第95号：现金流量表》（Statement of Cash Flows），是由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）于1987年发布的一项会计准则。该准则要求企业编制现金流量表，以反映企业在特定期间内的现金流入和流出情况，并将其分为经营活动、投资活动和筹资活动三大类。  
  FAS 95, officially known as "Statement of Cash Flows," is an accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 1987. It requires companies to prepare a cash flow statement that reflects the inflows and outflows of cash during a specific period, categorized into operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，FAS 95的理念被广泛应用于企业财务报表编制中，尤其是在上市公司和跨国企业中。现金流量表帮助投资者、债权人和其他利益相关者评估企业的流动性、偿债能力和财务健康状况。需要注意的是，现金流量表应与资产负债表和利润表结合使用，以避免单一报表的局限性。  
  In China, the principles of FAS 95 are widely applied in the preparation of corporate financial statements, especially among listed companies and multinational corporations. The cash flow statement helps investors, creditors, and other stakeholders assess a company's liquidity, solvency, and financial health. It is important to note that the cash flow statement should be used in conjunction with the balance sheet and income statement to avoid the limitations of a single report.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，FAS 95为财务报表的透明度和一致性提供了重要保障，有助于提升市场信心。从投资角度看，现金流量表是评估企业现金流管理能力的关键工具，能够帮助投资者识别潜在风险。从行业角度看，FAS 95的推广促进了全球会计准则的趋同，为跨国企业提供了统一的财务报告框架。  
  From a regulatory perspective, FAS 95 provides important safeguards for the transparency and consistency of financial statements, helping to boost market confidence. From an investment perspective, the cash flow statement is a key tool for assessing a company's cash flow management capabilities, enabling investors to identify potential risks. From an industry perspective, the promotion of FAS 95 has facilitated the convergence of global accounting standards, providing a unified financial reporting framework for multinational corporations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  FAS 95的制定源于20世纪80年代美国财务会计准则委员会对财务报表信息质量的改进需求。在此之前，企业主要依赖资产负债表和利润表，但这些报表无法全面反映企业的现金流状况。1987年，FASB正式发布FAS 95，要求所有企业编制现金流量表，以弥补这一缺陷。  
  The development of FAS 95 originated from the Financial Accounting Standards Board's need to improve the quality of financial statement information in the 1980s. Prior to this, companies primarily relied on the balance sheet and income statement, but these reports could not fully reflect a company's cash flow situation. In 1987, FASB officially issued FAS 95, requiring all companies to prepare cash flow statements to address this gap.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  FAS 95的发布对全球会计行业产生了深远影响。它不仅在美国被广泛采用，还成为国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的重要参考。在中国，FAS 95的理念被纳入《企业会计准则》，推动了国内企业财务报告的国际化进程。如今，现金流量表已成为全球企业财务报告的核心组成部分。  
  The release of FAS 95 has had a profound impact on the global accounting industry. It has not only been widely adopted in the United States but has also become an important reference for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In China, the principles of FAS 95 have been incorporated into the "Enterprise Accounting Standards," promoting the internationalization of domestic corporate financial reporting. Today, the cash flow statement has become a core component of global corporate financial reporting.
