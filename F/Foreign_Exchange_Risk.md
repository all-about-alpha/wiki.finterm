  **English Explanation**: Foreign Exchange Risk, also known as currency risk, refers to the potential financial loss that individuals or businesses may incur due to fluctuations in exchange rates during cross-border transactions or investments. This concept was first introduced by international finance scholars in the mid-20th century, with its core focus on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty on economic entities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：外汇风险主要应用于国际贸易、跨国投资以及外汇市场交易中。例如，中国企业从美国进口商品时，若人民币对美元贬值，将导致进口成本上升。风险提示包括汇率波动的不确定性、政策变化以及市场情绪的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Foreign exchange risk is primarily applied in international trade, cross-border investments, and foreign exchange market transactions. For example, when a Chinese company imports goods from the United States, a depreciation of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar will lead to higher import costs. Risk considerations include the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations, policy changes, and market sentiment.

  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，外汇风险管理是金融机构合规运营的重要环节；从投资角度看，汇率波动直接影响跨国投资回报；从行业角度看，全球化背景下，企业必须有效管理外汇风险以保持竞争力。

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：外汇风险的概念起源于20世纪中期，随着布雷顿森林体系的崩溃（1971年），全球汇率从固定转向浮动，汇率波动加剧，外汇风险逐渐成为国际金融领域的重要议题。经济学家如米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）对此进行了深入研究。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of foreign exchange risk originated in the mid-20th century. With the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, global exchange rates shifted from fixed to floating, leading to increased exchange rate volatility. Foreign exchange risk gradually became a significant topic in international finance, with economists such as Milton Friedman conducting in-depth research on the subject.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：外汇风险对国际贸易和投资产生了深远影响。例如，20世纪80年代的拉美债务危机和1997年的亚洲金融危机，均与汇率波动密切相关。如今，外汇风险管理已成为跨国企业和金融机构的核心能力之一。  
  **English Explanation**: Foreign exchange risk has had a profound impact on international trade and investment. For instance, the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s and the Asian financial crisis in 1997 were closely related to exchange rate fluctuations.
