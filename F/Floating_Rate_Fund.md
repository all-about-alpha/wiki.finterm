# Floating Rate Fund

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：浮动利率基金（Floating Rate Fund）是一种主要投资于浮动利率债券或贷款的基金。这类基金的投资标的通常与市场利率挂钩，如LIBOR（伦敦银行同业拆借利率）或SOFR（担保隔夜融资利率），其利率会随市场利率的波动而调整。浮动利率基金的核心特点是其收益与市场利率变化密切相关，适合在利率上升环境中表现较好。  
  - **English Explanation**: A Floating Rate Fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that primarily invests in floating-rate debt instruments, such as bonds or loans. These instruments are typically tied to benchmark interest rates like LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), meaning their interest payments adjust periodically based on market rate fluctuations. The key feature of such funds is their sensitivity to interest rate changes, making them particularly suitable for environments where interest rates are rising.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：浮动利率基金常用于投资者希望在利率上升周期中保护投资组合免受利率风险影响的场景。例如，当央行加息时，固定利率债券的价格通常会下跌，而浮动利率债券的利息支付会随利率上升而增加，从而为投资者提供一定的保护。此外，这类基金也适合追求稳定现金流的投资者，因为其利息支付会随市场利率调整。需要注意的是，浮动利率基金可能面临信用风险和流动性风险，尤其是在经济下行或市场波动较大的情况下。  
  - **English Application**: Floating Rate Funds are often used by investors seeking to hedge against interest rate risk during periods of rising rates. For example, when central banks raise interest rates, the prices of fixed-rate bonds typically fall, whereas the interest payments on floating-rate bonds increase, providing a cushion for investors. These funds are also suitable for investors seeking stable cash flows, as their interest payments adjust with market rates. However, it is important to note that Floating Rate Funds may be exposed to credit risk and liquidity risk, particularly during economic downturns or periods of high market volatility.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，浮动利率基金为投资者提供了一种有效的利率风险管理工具，尤其是在利率波动较大的市场环境中。从投资角度看，这类基金能够帮助投资者在利率上升时获得更高的收益，同时降低债券价格下跌的风险。从行业角度看，浮动利率基金的发展反映了金融市场对利率风险管理的需求增加，同时也推动了浮动利率债券市场的繁荣。  
  - **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Floating Rate Funds offer investors an effective tool for managing interest rate risk, particularly in volatile rate environments. From an investment standpoint, these funds can help investors achieve higher returns during periods of rising interest rates while mitigating the risk of bond price declines. From an industry perspective, the growth of Floating Rate Funds reflects the increasing demand for interest rate risk management in financial markets and has contributed to the expansion of the floating-rate debt market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：浮动利率基金的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代，当时全球金融市场经历了剧烈的利率波动，尤其是1973年石油危机后，利率大幅上升。为了应对这一变化，金融机构开始发行浮动利率债券，随后基金公司推出了专门投资于这类债券的浮动利率基金。最早的浮动利率基金主要面向机构投资者，后来逐渐向个人投资者开放。  
  - **English Origin**: The origin of Floating Rate Funds can be traced back to the 1970s, a period marked by significant interest rate volatility, particularly following the 1973 oil crisis, which led to sharp increases in interest rates. In response, financial institutions began issuing floating-rate bonds, and fund companies subsequently launched Floating Rate Funds dedicated to investing in these instruments. Initially, these funds were primarily targeted at institutional investors but later became accessible to individual investors.
