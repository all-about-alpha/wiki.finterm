# Four Percent Rule

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：四百分比规则（Four Percent Rule）是由财务规划师威廉·班根（William Bengen）在1994年提出的一项退休储蓄策略。该规则建议退休人员在退休后的第一年从退休储蓄中提取4%的资金，之后每年根据通货膨胀率调整提取金额。这一规则旨在确保退休储蓄能够持续30年或更长时间。  
  - **English Explanation**: The Four Percent Rule is a retirement savings strategy proposed by financial planner William Bengen in 1994. It suggests that retirees withdraw 4% of their retirement savings in the first year of retirement and adjust the amount annually based on inflation. The rule aims to ensure that retirement savings last for 30 years or more.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：四百分比规则广泛应用于个人退休规划中，尤其是在美国。它帮助退休人员确定每年可以从储蓄中安全提取的金额，以避免过早耗尽资金。然而，该规则假设退休投资组合以股票和债券为主，且市场回报率相对稳定。在实际应用中，需考虑市场波动、寿命延长等因素，适当调整提取比例。  
  - **English Application**: The Four Percent Rule is widely used in personal retirement planning, particularly in the United States. It helps retirees determine a safe annual withdrawal amount from their savings to avoid depleting funds too early. However, the rule assumes a retirement portfolio primarily composed of stocks and bonds with relatively stable market returns. In practice, factors such as market volatility and increased life expectancy should be considered, and the withdrawal rate may need adjustment.
