    外国证券投资（Foreign Portfolio Investment, FPI）是指外国投资者通过购买股票、债券、基金等金融工具，间接参与东道国资本市场的投资行为。FPI不涉及对企业的直接控制权，而是以获取资本增值或投资收益为目的。这一概念最早由国际货币基金组织（IMF）提出，用于区分直接投资（FDI）和间接投资。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) refers to the investment by foreign investors in a host country's capital markets through the purchase of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and funds. FPI does not involve direct control over enterprises but aims to achieve capital appreciation or investment returns. This concept was first introduced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to distinguish between direct investment (FDI) and indirect investment.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    FPI的概念起源于20世纪80年代，随着全球金融自由化浪潮的兴起，国际资本流动逐渐增加。国际货币基金组织（IMF）在1980年代正式提出FPI，以区分直接投资和间接投资。1990年代，新兴市场国家逐步开放资本市场，FPI成为全球资本流动的重要组成部分。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of FPI originated in the 1980s, coinciding with the wave of global financial liberalization, which led to increased international capital flows. The IMF formally introduced FPI in the 1980s to distinguish between direct and indirect investments. In the 1990s, emerging markets gradually opened their capital markets, making FPI a significant component of global capital flows.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**  
    FPI对新兴市场国家的资本市场发展起到了重要推动作用，但也带来了资本流动的波动性风险。例如，1997年亚洲金融危机期间，FPI的快速撤离加剧了市场动荡。目前，FPI仍是全球资本流动的主要形式之一，尤其在全球化背景下，其影响力进一步扩大。  
  - **English Impact**  
    FPI has significantly contributed to the development of capital markets in emerging economies but has also introduced volatility risks due to capital flow fluctuations. For instance, during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the rapid withdrawal of FPI exacerbated market instability. Today, FPI remains a major form of global capital flow, with its influence further expanding in the context of globalization.
