## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  终止经营的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪中期的美国会计准则发展。随着企业并购和分拆活动的增加，会计准则制定机构意识到需要明确区分持续经营和终止经营的财务表现。1973年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）发布了相关准则，要求企业在财务报表中单独披露终止经营的信息。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of discontinued operations can be traced back to the development of U.S. accounting standards in the mid-20th century. As corporate mergers and divestitures increased, accounting standard-setting bodies recognized the need to clearly distinguish between the financial performance of continuing and discontinued operations. In 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued relevant standards requiring companies to separately disclose information about discontinued operations in their financial statements.

* **影响 / Impact**

  **English Impact**：  
  The classification of discontinued operations has had a profound impact on the financial reporting of companies worldwide. It has not only enhanced the transparency of financial statements but also helped investors better assess the performance of a company's core business.
