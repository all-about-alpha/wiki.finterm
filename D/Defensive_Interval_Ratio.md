# Defensive Interval Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **防御区间比率**（Defensive Interval Ratio, DIR）是一种衡量企业短期流动性的财务指标，用于评估企业在不依赖外部融资或额外收入的情况下，仅依靠其流动资产（如现金、现金等价物和短期投资）能够维持日常运营的天数。该比率由财务分析师提出，核心概念是通过计算企业的流动资产与每日运营支出的比率，来判断企业的财务健康状况。  
  The **Defensive Interval Ratio (DIR)** is a financial metric used to assess a company's short-term liquidity by measuring the number of days the company can sustain its daily operations using only its liquid assets (such as cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) without relying on external financing or additional revenue. This ratio, introduced by financial analysts, focuses on calculating the ratio of a company's liquid assets to its daily operating expenses to evaluate its financial health.

* **应用 / Application**  
  防御区间比率常用于企业财务分析中，特别是在评估企业的短期偿债能力和财务稳定性时。它适用于现金流波动较大的行业（如零售、制造业）或经济不确定性较高的时期。需要注意的是，该比率假设企业不会产生新的收入或融资，因此在实际情况中需结合其他财务指标综合判断。  
  The Defensive Interval Ratio is commonly used in corporate financial analysis, particularly when assessing a company's short-term solvency and financial stability. It is especially relevant in industries with significant cash flow volatility (e.g., retail, manufacturing) or during periods of economic uncertainty. It is important to note that this ratio assumes no new revenue or financing, so it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics for a comprehensive evaluation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，防御区间比率有助于评估企业的财务韧性，确保其在经济下行或市场波动时仍能维持运营。从投资角度看，该指标为投资者提供了企业短期风险的重要参考。对于行业而言，高防御区间比率的企业通常被视为更具抗风险能力，能够在危机中保持竞争力。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Defensive Interval Ratio helps assess a company's financial resilience, ensuring it can sustain operations during economic downturns or market volatility. From an investment standpoint, this metric provides critical insights into a company's short-term risk profile. For industries, companies with a high DIR are often seen as more resilient and better positioned to maintain competitiveness during crises.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  防御区间比率的起源可以追溯到20世纪中期的财务分析实践。当时，随着企业财务管理的复杂化，分析师们开始寻找更精细的工具来评估企业的流动性风险。该比率的提出填补了传统流动性指标（如流动比率和速动比率）的不足，成为衡量企业短期财务健康的重要补充。  
  The Defensive Interval Ratio originated in the mid-20th century as part of financial analysis practices. As corporate financial management became more complex, analysts sought more refined tools to assess liquidity risks. The introduction of this ratio addressed the limitations of traditional liquidity metrics (such as the current ratio and quick ratio) and became a vital supplement for evaluating short-term financial health.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  防御区间比率在财务分析领域产生了深远影响，特别是在2008年全球金融危机后，其重要性进一步凸显。许多企业和投资者开始将其作为评估财务稳健性的关键指标。如今，该比率广泛应用于全球范围内的企业财务分析和信用评级中，成为衡量企业抗风险能力的重要工具。  
  The Defensive Interval Ratio has had a profound impact on financial analysis, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, when its importance became even more pronounced. Many companies and investors now use it as a key metric for assessing financial robustness. Today, it is widely applied in corporate financial analysis and credit ratings worldwide, serving as a critical tool for measuring risk resilience.
