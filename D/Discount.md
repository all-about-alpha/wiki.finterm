  折扣广泛应用于零售、电商、餐饮等行业。例如，双十一购物节期间，电商平台会提供大幅折扣以吸引消费者；实体商店则通过季节性折扣清理库存。需要注意的是，过度依赖折扣可能损害品牌价值，导致消费者对原价产生抵触心理。  
  **English Application**  
  Discounts are widely used in retail, e-commerce, and the food and beverage industry. For instance, during events like Black Friday or Singles' Day, e-commerce platforms offer significant discounts to attract consumers, while physical stores use seasonal discounts to clear inventory.

  从监管角度看，折扣活动需遵守相关法律法规，避免虚假宣传或价格欺诈。从投资和行业角度看，合理的折扣策略能提升企业短期业绩，但长期依赖可能影响利润率。对于消费者而言，折扣是节省开支的重要方式，但也需警惕“伪折扣”陷阱。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, discount activities must comply with relevant laws to avoid false advertising or price fraud. From an investment and industry standpoint, a reasonable discount strategy can boost short-term performance, but long-term reliance may affect profit margins.
