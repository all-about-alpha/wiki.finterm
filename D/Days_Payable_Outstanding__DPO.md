# Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：应付账款周转天数（Days Payable Outstanding, DPO）是衡量企业支付其应付账款所需时间的财务指标。它反映了企业在支付供应商货款方面的效率，通常以天数表示。DPO的计算公式为：DPO = （应付账款 / 销售成本） × 天数。较高的DPO意味着企业能够更长时间地占用供应商的资金，从而改善现金流；但过高的DPO也可能导致供应商关系紧张。  
  - **English Explanation**: Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) is a financial metric that measures the average number of days a company takes to pay its accounts payable. It reflects the efficiency of a company in managing its payments to suppliers and is typically expressed in days. The formula for DPO is: DPO = (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) × Number of Days. A higher DPO indicates that a company is able to delay payments to suppliers, thereby improving cash flow; however, excessively high DPO may strain supplier relationships.

  - **中文应用场景**：DPO常用于企业财务分析中，帮助管理层评估现金流管理效率。较高的DPO可能意味着企业能够更好地利用供应商的资金，但同时也可能面临供应商信用风险。在供应链管理中，DPO的合理控制有助于维持良好的供应商关系，避免因延迟付款导致的供应链中断。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**: DPO is commonly used in corporate financial analysis to help management assess the efficiency of cash flow management. A higher DPO may indicate that a company is effectively utilizing supplier funds, but it also carries the risk of supplier credit issues. In supply chain management, maintaining an appropriate DPO helps sustain good supplier relationships and avoids disruptions caused by delayed payments.
