# Deferred Revenue

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：递延收入（Deferred Revenue）是指企业已经收到客户支付的款项，但尚未履行或完成相关义务的收入。根据会计准则，这部分收入不能立即确认为当期收入，而需要在未来履行义务时逐步确认。递延收入通常出现在预收款、订阅服务或长期合同中。  
  **English Explanation**: Deferred Revenue refers to the income a company has received from customers but has not yet fulfilled or completed the related obligations. According to accounting principles, this income cannot be recognized as current revenue immediately and must be recognized gradually as the obligations are fulfilled in the future. Deferred revenue commonly arises in scenarios such as advance payments, subscription services, or long-term contracts.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：递延收入常见于软件订阅、会员服务、预付费课程等行业。例如，某公司销售一年期的软件订阅服务，客户一次性支付全年费用，但公司需按月提供服务。此时，公司需将收到的款项确认为递延收入，并在每月提供服务时逐步确认收入。风险在于，若公司无法履行义务，可能面临退款或法律纠纷。  
  **English Application**: Deferred revenue is commonly seen in industries such as software subscriptions, membership services, and prepaid courses. For example, a company sells a one-year software subscription, and the customer pays the full annual fee upfront. However, the company must provide services monthly. In this case, the company records the payment as deferred revenue and recognizes the revenue gradually as services are provided each month. The risk lies in the company's inability to fulfill its obligations, which may lead to refunds or legal disputes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，递延收入的正确处理有助于确保财务报表的准确性和透明度，避免虚增当期收入。从投资角度看，递延收入反映了企业的未来收入潜力，是评估企业现金流和财务健康的重要指标。从行业角度看，递延收入模式（如订阅制）已成为许多科技和服务企业的核心商业模式。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the proper handling of deferred revenue ensures the accuracy and transparency of financial statements, avoiding the overstatement of current revenue. From an investment perspective, deferred revenue reflects a company's future revenue potential and is a key indicator for assessing cash flow and financial health. From an industry perspective, the deferred revenue model (e.g., subscription-based) has become a core business model for many technology and service companies.
