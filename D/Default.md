# Default

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：违约（Default）是指债务人未能按照合同约定的条款履行其债务义务的行为。这通常包括未能按时支付利息或本金，或违反了贷款协议中的其他条款。违约可以由个人、企业或政府实体引发，是金融市场中常见的风险之一。  
  **English Explanation**: Default refers to the failure of a debtor to meet their obligations as stipulated in a contract. This typically includes failing to make timely payments of interest or principal, or breaching other terms of the loan agreement. Default can be triggered by individuals, businesses, or government entities and is a common risk in financial markets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：违约在金融市场中广泛存在，尤其是在债券市场、贷款市场和信用衍生品市场。例如，当一家公司无法偿还其发行的债券时，就会发生债券违约。违约可能导致债权人采取法律行动，如申请破产清算或重组。投资者在评估债券或贷款时，通常会关注违约风险，并通过信用评级机构（如标普、穆迪）的评级来判断违约的可能性。  
  **English Application**: Default is prevalent in financial markets, especially in bond markets, loan markets, and credit derivatives markets. For instance, when a company fails to repay its issued bonds, a bond default occurs. Default may lead creditors to take legal actions, such as filing for bankruptcy liquidation or restructuring. Investors assessing bonds or loans often focus on default risk and use credit ratings from agencies like S&P or Moody's to gauge the likelihood of default.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：违约在金融监管、投资决策和行业分析中具有重要意义。从监管角度看，违约率是衡量金融市场稳定性的重要指标，监管机构会通过制定政策来降低系统性违约风险。从投资角度看，违约风险直接影响资产定价和投资组合管理，高违约风险通常伴随着高收益。从行业角度看，违约事件可能引发连锁反应，影响整个行业的信用环境。  
  **English Significance**: Default holds significant importance in financial regulation, investment decision-making, and industry analysis. From a regulatory perspective, default rates are key indicators of financial market stability, and regulators implement policies to mitigate systemic default risks. From an investment standpoint, default risk directly impacts asset pricing and portfolio management, with higher default risks often associated with higher returns. From an industry perspective, default events can trigger chain reactions, affecting the credit environment of the entire sector.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：违约的概念可以追溯到古代借贷行为。早在古罗马时期，债务人未能偿还债务时，债权人有权将其变为奴隶或没收其财产。现代意义上的违约概念则起源于17世纪的欧洲，随着债券市场的兴起，违约成为金融体系中的重要风险。例如，1720年的南海泡沫事件中，大量投资者因公司违约而遭受损失。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of default dates back to ancient lending practices. In ancient Rome, creditors had the right to enslave debtors or confiscate their property if they failed to repay debts. The modern concept of default emerged in 17th-century Europe with the rise of bond markets, making default a critical risk in financial systems. For example, during the South Sea Bubble of 1720, many investors suffered losses due to corporate defaults.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：违约对金融市场和实体经济具有深远影响。例如，2008年全球金融危机中，次贷违约引发了连锁反应，导致全球金融市场动荡和经济衰退。在中国，近年来企业违约事件频发，尤其是房地产行业，引发了市场对信用风险的广泛关注。违约不仅影响债权人和债务人，还可能波及整个金融体系和经济环境。  
  **English Impact**: Default has profound effects on financial markets and the real economy. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, subprime mortgage defaults triggered a chain reaction, leading to global financial turmoil and economic recession. In China, frequent corporate defaults in recent years, particularly in the real estate sector, have drawn widespread attention to credit risks. Default not only affects creditors and debtors but can also ripple through the entire financial system and economic environment.
