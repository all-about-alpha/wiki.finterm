# Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  美元成本平均法（Dollar-Cost Averaging, DCA）是一种投资策略，指投资者在固定的时间间隔内，以固定的金额购买某种投资标的（如股票、基金等），无论市场价格如何波动。这种方法的核心在于通过定期投资来平滑市场波动带来的风险，降低单次投资时机的选择压力。该策略最早由美国经济学家本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）提出，并在其著作《聪明的投资者》中推广。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where an investor allocates a fixed amount of money at regular intervals to purchase a particular investment (e.g., stocks, mutual funds), regardless of the asset's price fluctuations. The core concept is to mitigate the impact of market volatility by spreading out investments over time, thereby reducing the pressure of timing the market. This strategy was popularized by American economist Benjamin Graham in his book *The Intelligent Investor*.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：  
  美元成本平均法常用于长期投资，尤其适合波动性较大的市场或资产类别（如股票、加密货币）。投资者可以通过定期定额投资，避免因市场短期波动而做出情绪化决策。然而，这种方法在长期牛市中的收益可能低于一次性投资，且无法完全规避市场下跌风险。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  DCA is commonly used in long-term investing, particularly for volatile markets or asset classes (e.g., stocks, cryptocurrencies). By investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, investors can avoid emotional decision-making caused by short-term market fluctuations. However, this method may yield lower returns than lump-sum investing during prolonged bull markets and does not entirely eliminate the risk of market downturns.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：  
  从投资角度看，美元成本平均法帮助投资者克服“择时”难题，降低心理压力，适合缺乏专业投资知识或时间的人群。从行业角度看，该方法被广泛用于基金定投计划，成为资产管理公司吸引长期客户的重要工具。监管机构也认可其作为一种稳健的投资策略，有助于市场稳定。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  From an investment perspective, DCA helps investors overcome the challenge of market timing and reduces psychological stress, making it suitable for individuals with limited investment knowledge or time. From an industry perspective, this method is widely used in systematic investment plans (SIPs) and serves as a key tool for asset management companies to attract long-term clients. Regulatory bodies also recognize it as a prudent investment strategy that contributes to market stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：  
  美元成本平均法的概念最早可追溯至20世纪40年代，由本杰明·格雷厄姆在其著作《聪明的投资者》中提出。格雷厄姆强调，普通投资者应通过定期投资来分散风险，而非试图预测市场短期波动。这一理念后来被广泛应用于共同基金和退休金计划中，成为现代投资理论的基石之一。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  The concept of DCA dates back to the 1940s, introduced by Benjamin Graham in his book *The Intelligent Investor*. Graham emphasized that average investors should mitigate risk through regular investments rather than attempting to predict short-term market movements. This idea was later widely adopted in mutual funds and retirement plans, becoming a cornerstone of modern investment theory.

  美元成本平均法对全球投资行业产生了深远影响。它不仅成为个人投资者的常用策略，还被机构投资者用于管理大规模资金。在加密货币等新兴市场中，DCA也被视为一种降低波动性风险的有效方法。如今，该方法已成为金融教育的重要内容，帮助更多人理解长期投资的优势。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  DCA has had a profound impact on the global investment industry. It is not only a common strategy for individual investors but also used by institutional investors to manage large-scale funds. In emerging markets like cryptocurrencies, DCA is seen as an effective way to mitigate volatility risks.
