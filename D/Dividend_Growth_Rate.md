# Dividend Growth Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：股息增长率（Dividend Growth Rate）是指一家公司在一定时期内每股股息（Dividend per Share, DPS）的年均增长率。它反映了公司向股东分配利润的增长速度，是衡量公司财务健康状况和股东回报能力的重要指标。股息增长率的计算通常基于历史数据，并用于预测未来股息增长趋势。  
  **English Explanation**: The Dividend Growth Rate refers to the annualized growth rate of a company's dividend per share (DPS) over a specific period. It reflects the rate at which a company increases its dividend payments to shareholders, serving as a key metric for assessing the company's financial health and its ability to reward shareholders. The calculation is typically based on historical data and is used to forecast future dividend growth trends.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：股息增长率广泛应用于投资分析和估值模型中，如股息贴现模型（Dividend Discount Model, DDM）。投资者通过分析股息增长率来评估股票的长期回报潜力，尤其是对于追求稳定现金流的投资者（如退休人士）。然而，高股息增长率并不总是可持续的，投资者需结合公司的盈利能力和现金流状况进行综合判断。  
  **English Explanation**: The Dividend Growth Rate is widely used in investment analysis and valuation models, such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). Investors analyze this rate to assess the long-term return potential of a stock, particularly for those seeking stable cash flows (e.g., retirees). However, a high dividend growth rate is not always sustainable, and investors must evaluate it alongside the company's profitability and cash flow conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，稳定的股息增长率通常被视为公司财务稳健的信号；从投资角度看，它是评估股票吸引力的重要指标，尤其在高股息股票（Dividend Aristocrats）中；从行业角度看，高股息增长率可能反映行业的高盈利能力和低竞争压力。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, a stable dividend growth rate is often seen as a sign of financial health. From an investment standpoint, it is a critical metric for evaluating a stock's attractiveness, especially among high-dividend stocks (e.g., Dividend Aristocrats). From an industry perspective, a high dividend growth rate may indicate strong profitability and low competitive pressure.
