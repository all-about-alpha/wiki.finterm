  **Deficit Spending** refers to the economic behavior where a government's expenditures exceed its revenues over a certain period. This concept is often associated with fiscal policy, where the government borrows or issues bonds to cover the fiscal deficit, aiming to stimulate economic growth or address economic downturns. Key concepts include fiscal deficit, public debt, and fiscal policy tools.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，赤字支出常用于基础设施建设、社会福利项目和应对经济危机。例如，2008年全球金融危机期间，中国政府通过大规模赤字支出实施了4万亿元人民币的经济刺激计划。然而，过度依赖赤字支出可能导致公共债务累积，增加财政风险。  
  In China, deficit spending is often used for infrastructure construction, social welfare programs, and addressing economic crises. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, the Chinese government implemented a 4 trillion yuan economic stimulus plan through large-scale deficit spending. However, excessive reliance on deficit spending may lead to the accumulation of public debt and increase fiscal risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，赤字支出是政府调节经济的重要工具，尤其在应对经济衰退时。从投资角度看，赤字支出可能带动相关行业增长，但也需警惕债务风险。从行业角度看，赤字支出对基础设施建设、公共服务等领域有直接推动作用。  
  From a regulatory perspective, deficit spending is a crucial tool for governments to regulate the economy, especially during economic downturns. From an investment perspective, deficit spending may drive growth in related industries but also requires vigilance against debt risks. From an industry perspective, deficit spending directly promotes sectors like infrastructure construction and public services.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  赤字支出的概念可以追溯到20世纪初，特别是凯恩斯主义经济学的兴起。约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯在其1936年出版的《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出，政府应通过增加支出来刺激经济，尤其是在经济衰退期间。这一理论在二战后被广泛采纳，成为许多国家经济政策的核心。  
  The concept of deficit spending dates back to the early 20th century, particularly with the rise of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes, in his 1936 book "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money," proposed that governments should increase spending to stimulate the economy, especially during recessions. This theory was widely adopted after World War II and became a cornerstone of economic policy in many countries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  赤字支出在全球范围内产生了深远影响。例如，美国在20世纪30年代的大萧条期间和2008年金融危机后，都通过大规模赤字支出刺激经济。在中国，赤字支出在改革开放后的经济腾飞中发挥了重要作用，特别是在基础设施建设和区域经济发展方面。  
  Deficit spending has had a profound impact globally. For example, the United States used large-scale deficit spending during the Great Depression of the 1930s and after the 2008 financial crisis to stimulate the economy. In China, deficit spending played a significant role in the economic boom following the reform and opening-up, particularly in infrastructure construction and regional economic development.
