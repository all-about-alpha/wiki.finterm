# Direct Quote

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：直接报价（Direct Quote）是外汇市场中一种报价方式，表示用本国货币来表示一单位外国货币的价格。例如，在中国，如果美元对人民币的直接报价为6.5，意味着1美元可以兑换6.5元人民币。直接报价的核心概念是“以本币计价外币”，常用于本国货币为主要交易货币的市场。  
  **English Explanation**: A direct quote is a method of quoting exchange rates in the foreign exchange market, where the price of one unit of a foreign currency is expressed in terms of the domestic currency. For example, in China, if the direct quote for USD/CNY is 6.5, it means that 1 US dollar can be exchanged for 6.5 Chinese yuan. The core concept of a direct quote is "pricing foreign currency in domestic currency," commonly used in markets where the domestic currency is the primary trading currency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：直接报价广泛应用于国际贸易、外汇交易和跨境投资中。例如，中国企业进口商品时，需要将美元价格转换为人民币，直接报价提供了直观的汇率参考。需要注意的是，直接报价可能因市场波动而产生汇率风险，企业需采取对冲措施。  
  **English Explanation**: Direct quotes are widely used in international trade, foreign exchange transactions, and cross-border investments. For instance, when Chinese companies import goods, they need to convert US dollar prices into Chinese yuan, and direct quotes provide an intuitive exchange rate reference. It is important to note that direct quotes may be subject to exchange rate risks due to market fluctuations, and companies need to adopt hedging strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：直接报价的起源可以追溯到金本位制时期（19世纪末至20世纪初），当时各国货币与黄金挂钩，汇率相对固定。随着布雷顿森林体系的建立（1944年），美元成为国际储备货币，直接报价逐渐成为外汇市场的主流报价方式。20世纪70年代，浮动汇率制取代固定汇率制，直接报价的应用更加广泛。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of direct quotes can be traced back to the gold standard era (late 19th to early 20th century), when currencies were pegged to gold, and exchange rates were relatively fixed. With the establishment of the Bretton Woods system in 1944, the US dollar became the international reserve currency, and direct quotes gradually became the mainstream method of quoting exchange rates. In the 1970s, the floating exchange rate system replaced the fixed exchange rate system, leading to the wider application of direct quotes.
