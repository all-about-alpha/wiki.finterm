# Dove

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  在金融领域，“Dove”（鸽派）通常指那些倾向于采取宽松货币政策的经济政策制定者或央行官员。鸽派主张通过降低利率、增加货币供应等手段来刺激经济增长，通常在经济衰退或低通胀时期采取行动。鸽派的核心概念是优先考虑就业和经济增长，而非过度关注通胀风险。  
  **English Explanation**  
  In finance, a "Dove" refers to policymakers or central bank officials who favor accommodative monetary policies. Doves advocate for measures such as lowering interest rates and increasing money supply to stimulate economic growth, typically during periods of economic downturn or low inflation. The core concept of a Dove is prioritizing employment and economic growth over excessive concern about inflation risks.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  鸽派政策通常在经济增长乏力、失业率上升或通胀率低于目标水平时被采用。例如，美联储在经济衰退期间可能会降低利率或实施量化宽松政策。然而，过度宽松的货币政策可能导致资产泡沫或长期通胀风险，因此需谨慎权衡。  
  **English Application**  
  Dove policies are typically adopted during periods of weak economic growth, rising unemployment, or inflation below target levels. For example, the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates or implement quantitative easing during a recession. However, excessively accommodative policies can lead to asset bubbles or long-term inflation risks, requiring careful balancing.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，鸽派政策对市场情绪和经济走向有重要影响。鸽派立场通常被视为利好股市和债市，因为低利率环境有助于降低融资成本并刺激投资。然而，投资者也需警惕潜在的通胀风险和资产价格波动。  
  **English Significance**  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Dove policies significantly influence market sentiment and economic direction. A Dove stance is generally seen as positive for stock and bond markets, as low interest rates reduce financing costs and stimulate investment. However, investors must also be wary of potential inflation risks and asset price volatility.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **中文起源**  
  “鸽派”一词源自政治领域，用于形容主张和平与妥协的政治人物。20世纪中后期，这一术语被引入经济学领域，特指那些支持宽松货币政策的经济学家或政策制定者。例如，美联储前主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）因其在2008年金融危机期间采取的量化宽松政策而被视为典型的鸽派代表。
