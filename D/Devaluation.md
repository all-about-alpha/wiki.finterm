* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    贬值常用于国际贸易中，当一国出口商品价格过高导致竞争力下降时，政府可能通过贬值降低本国商品在国际市场的价格，从而刺激出口。然而，贬值也可能导致进口商品价格上涨，引发通货膨胀风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    Devaluation is often used in international trade when a country's export prices are too high, reducing competitiveness. By devaluing its currency, the government can lower the price of domestic goods in international markets, boosting exports. However, devaluation may also lead to higher import prices and inflation risks.
