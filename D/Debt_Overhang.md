# Debt Overhang

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：债务积压（Debt Overhang）是指企业或国家因累积过多债务，导致其未来现金流不足以偿还债务本息，从而抑制了进一步投资或经济增长的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家Stewart Myers在1977年提出，核心在于债务负担对未来决策的负面影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Debt Overhang refers to a situation where a company or country has accumulated so much debt that its future cash flows are insufficient to cover the principal and interest payments, thereby discouraging further investment or economic growth. This concept was first introduced by economist Stewart Myers in 1977, emphasizing the negative impact of debt burden on future decision-making.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：债务积压常见于高负债企业或陷入财政危机的国家。例如，企业在经济下行期因过度借贷而面临偿债压力，导致其无法进行新项目投资；国家在主权债务危机中因债务负担过重而难以恢复经济增长。风险在于，债务积压可能导致企业破产或国家经济长期停滞。  
  **English Application**: Debt Overhang is often observed in highly leveraged companies or countries facing fiscal crises. For instance, companies may struggle to invest in new projects due to repayment pressures during economic downturns, while countries burdened with excessive sovereign debt may find it difficult to revive economic growth. The risk lies in potential bankruptcy for companies or prolonged economic stagnation for nations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，债务积压提醒政策制定者关注债务可持续性；从投资角度看，投资者需警惕高负债企业的偿债风险；从行业角度看，债务积压可能抑制创新和竞争力。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Debt Overhang highlights the importance of debt sustainability for policymakers. For investors, it serves as a warning about the repayment risks of highly leveraged companies. From an industry standpoint, it can stifle innovation and competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：债务积压的概念由Stewart Myers在1977年提出，源于对企业资本结构的研究。Myers发现，当企业债务过高时，股东可能因担心未来收益被债权人优先索取而放弃有价值的投资项目，这一现象被称为“债务积压效应”。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of Debt Overhang was introduced by Stewart Myers in 1977, stemming from his research on corporate capital structure. Myers observed that when a company's debt is too high, shareholders might forgo valuable investment opportunities due to concerns that future earnings would be claimed by creditors first, a phenomenon known as the "Debt Overhang Effect."

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：债务积压在2008年全球金融危机期间尤为显著，许多企业和国家因高杠杆率陷入困境。如今，债务积压仍是企业财务管理和国家经济政策中的重要议题。  
  **English Impact**: Debt Overhang became particularly prominent during the 2008 global financial crisis, as many companies and countries struggled with high leverage. Today, it remains a critical issue in corporate financial management and national economic policies.
