    DINK households typically have higher disposable income, allowing for greater flexibility in consumption, investment, and lifestyle choices. They often prioritize high-quality living, such as luxury consumption, travel, and real estate investments. However, this family structure may also face risks related to retirement and long-term financial planning, as there are no children to provide future economic support.
