# Depreciable Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  折旧资产（Depreciable Asset）是指企业拥有并用于生产经营活动，且其价值会随着时间的推移而逐渐减少的长期资产。这类资产通常包括厂房、设备、车辆等，其价值减少的原因可能是物理磨损、技术过时或市场变化等。折旧资产的核心概念在于其价值的递减性，企业可以通过折旧的方式将其成本分摊到多个会计期间，以反映其使用过程中的价值损耗。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A depreciable asset is a long-term asset owned and used by a business in its operations, whose value decreases over time due to factors such as physical wear and tear, technological obsolescence, or market changes. Common examples include buildings, machinery, and vehicles. The key concept of a depreciable asset lies in its declining value, and businesses can allocate its cost over multiple accounting periods through depreciation to reflect its value reduction during usage.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  折旧资产广泛应用于制造业、交通运输业、建筑业等行业。例如，一家制造企业购买的生产设备在使用过程中会逐渐磨损，其价值会逐年减少，企业可以通过折旧的方式将设备成本分摊到其使用寿命内。需要注意的是，折旧方法的选择（如直线法、双倍余额递减法等）会影响企业的财务报表和税务处理，因此企业需根据实际情况选择合适的折旧方法。  
  **English Application**：  
  Depreciable assets are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and construction. For example, a manufacturing company's production equipment will gradually wear out over time, and its value will decrease annually. The company can allocate the equipment's cost over its useful life through depreciation. It is important to note that the choice of depreciation method (e.g., straight-line, double-declining balance) can impact financial statements and tax treatment, so businesses must select an appropriate method based on their specific circumstances.
