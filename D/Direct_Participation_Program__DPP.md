## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

    直接参与计划（Direct Participation Program, DPP）是一种投资工具，允许投资者直接参与特定项目或企业的收益和损失。这类计划通常用于房地产、能源、自然资源等领域，投资者通过购买有限合伙权益或其他类似结构，直接分享项目的经济成果。DPP的核心概念是“直接参与”，即投资者不通过中间机构，而是直接与项目或企业产生经济利益关系。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A Direct Participation Program (DPP) is an investment vehicle that allows investors to directly participate in the income and losses of a specific project or business. These programs are commonly used in sectors such as real estate, energy, and natural resources. Investors purchase limited partnership interests or similar structures to directly share in the economic outcomes of the project. The core concept of a DPP is "direct participation," meaning investors engage directly with the project or business without intermediaries.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    DPP广泛应用于房地产投资信托（REITs）、油气勘探、农业项目等领域。投资者通过DPP可以直接参与项目的运营和收益分配，但也需承担相应的风险，如市场波动、项目失败等。在中国，DPP通常用于私募股权投资或特定行业的项目融资，投资者需注意项目的合规性和潜在风险。  
  - **English Application**  
    DPPs are widely used in real estate investment trusts (REITs), oil and gas exploration, agricultural projects, and more. Through DPPs, investors can directly participate in the operation and profit distribution of projects but must also bear associated risks, such as market volatility and project failure. In China, DPPs are often used in private equity investments or project financing in specific industries. Investors should pay attention to compliance and potential risks.

    从监管角度看，DPP为投资者提供了多样化的投资渠道，但也需要严格的监管以保护投资者权益。从投资角度看，DPP为高净值个人和机构投资者提供了直接参与高收益项目的机会。从行业角度看，DPP推动了特定领域（如能源、房地产）的资本流动和项目发展。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, DPPs provide diversified investment channels but require strict oversight to protect investor rights. From an investment standpoint, DPPs offer high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors opportunities to directly participate in high-yield projects. From an industry perspective, DPPs facilitate capital flow and project development in specific sectors, such as energy and real estate.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

    DPP的概念起源于20世纪70年代的美国，当时能源危机推动了油气勘探项目的融资需求。有限合伙企业（Limited Partnership）成为DPP的主要形式，投资者通过购买有限合伙权益参与项目。这一模式后来扩展到房地产和其他行业，成为美国资本市场的重要组成部分。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of DPPs originated in the United States in the 1970s, driven by the energy crisis and the need for financing oil and gas exploration projects. Limited partnerships became the primary structure for DPPs, allowing investors to participate in projects by purchasing limited partnership interests. This model later expanded to real estate and other industries, becoming a significant part of the U.S. capital market.
