# Dutch Disease

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  荷兰病（Dutch Disease）是指一个国家或地区因某一特定资源（如自然资源）的繁荣而导致其他经济部门（如制造业或农业）衰退的现象。这一概念最早由《经济学人》杂志在1977年提出，用以描述荷兰在20世纪60年代发现大量天然气资源后，制造业和出口部门受到冲击的情况。核心概念包括资源繁荣、汇率上升、非资源部门竞争力下降等。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Dutch Disease refers to the economic phenomenon where the discovery and exploitation of a specific resource (e.g., natural resources) in a country or region leads to the decline of other economic sectors (e.g., manufacturing or agriculture). The term was first coined by *The Economist* in 1977 to describe the situation in the Netherlands after the discovery of large natural gas reserves in the 1960s, which caused a decline in the manufacturing and export sectors. Key concepts include resource boom, currency appreciation, and loss of competitiveness in non-resource sectors.  

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  荷兰病常见于资源丰富的国家，如石油出口国或矿产大国。例如，中东石油出口国在石油价格高涨时，往往面临制造业和农业的萎缩。风险在于过度依赖单一资源，导致经济结构失衡，长期发展受限。  

  **English Application**  
  Dutch Disease is often observed in resource-rich countries, such as oil-exporting nations or mineral-rich economies. For instance, Middle Eastern oil exporters often experience a decline in manufacturing and agriculture during periods of high oil prices. The risk lies in over-reliance on a single resource, leading to economic imbalance and long-term development constraints.  

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，荷兰病提醒各国政府避免过度依赖单一资源，需通过多元化经济政策和汇率管理来平衡资源繁荣对其他部门的负面影响。对于投资者而言，需警惕资源型经济体的结构性风险。  

  **English Significance**  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Dutch Disease serves as a warning for governments to avoid over-reliance on a single resource. Diversified economic policies and exchange rate management are essential to mitigate the negative impact of resource booms on other sectors. For investors, it highlights the structural risks of resource-dependent economies.  

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  荷兰病的概念源于20世纪60年代荷兰发现大量天然气资源后，天然气出口收入激增，导致荷兰盾汇率大幅升值。这使得荷兰的制造业和出口部门失去竞争力，经济结构失衡。1977年，《经济学人》首次使用“荷兰病”一词来描述这一现象。  

  **English Origin**  
  The concept of Dutch Disease originated in the 1960s when the Netherlands discovered large natural gas reserves. The surge in gas export revenues led to a significant appreciation of the Dutch guilder, causing the manufacturing and export sectors to lose competitiveness and resulting in economic imbalance. The term was first used by *The Economist* in 1977 to describe this phenomenon.  

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  荷兰病对资源型经济体的影响深远。例如，尼日利亚和委内瑞拉等石油出口国在资源繁荣时期，制造业和农业部门严重萎缩，经济结构单一化。目前，许多国家通过设立主权财富基金、推动产业多元化等措施来应对荷兰病。  

  **English Impact**  
  Dutch Disease has had a profound impact on resource-dependent economies. For example, oil-exporting countries like Nigeria and Venezuela experienced significant declines in their manufacturing and agricultural sectors during resource booms, leading to economic monoculture. Today, many countries address Dutch Disease by establishing sovereign wealth funds and promoting industrial diversification.
