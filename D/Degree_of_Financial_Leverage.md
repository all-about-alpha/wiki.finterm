## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    财务杠杆程度（Degree of Financial Leverage, DFL）是衡量企业利用债务融资对每股收益（EPS）波动影响的指标。它反映了企业固定财务费用（如利息）对盈利能力的放大效应。核心概念包括财务杠杆效应、息税前利润（EBIT）和每股收益（EPS）。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL) is a metric that measures the impact of a company's use of debt financing on the volatility of its earnings per share (EPS). It reflects the magnification effect of fixed financial costs (such as interest) on profitability. Key concepts include financial leverage effect, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and earnings per share (EPS).

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用**  
    财务杠杆程度常用于评估企业在不同资本结构下的风险与收益。高DFL意味着企业盈利波动性较大，适合高成长性行业或经济景气期；低DFL则适合稳健型企业或经济下行期。需注意，过度依赖债务可能导致财务风险加剧，甚至引发偿债危机。  
  - **English Application**  
    DFL is commonly used to assess the risk and return of a company under different capital structures. A high DFL indicates greater volatility in earnings, making it suitable for high-growth industries or during economic booms; a low DFL is better for stable companies or during economic downturns. It is important to note that excessive reliance on debt can exacerbate financial risks and even lead to solvency crises.
