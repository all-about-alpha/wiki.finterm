# Defeasance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  债务解除（Defeasance）是一种金融操作，指债务人通过将足够的资产（通常是低风险的政府债券）存入一个独立的信托账户，以覆盖未来债务的本金和利息支付，从而在法律上解除其对债务的责任。这一过程通常用于提前终止债务合同，尤其是在房地产抵押贷款或公司债券中。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Defeasance is a financial process where a debtor places sufficient assets (typically low-risk government bonds) into a separate trust account to cover future principal and interest payments of a debt, thereby legally releasing the debtor from the obligation. This process is commonly used to terminate debt contracts early, particularly in real estate mortgages or corporate bonds.

  **English Application**：  
  Defeasance is often used in scenarios involving early repayment of real estate mortgages or corporate bonds. For example, when a company wishes to repay bonds early but the contract does not allow direct repayment, defeasance can be utilized.
