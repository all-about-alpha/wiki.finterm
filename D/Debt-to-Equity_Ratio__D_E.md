## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    债务股本比（Debt-to-Equity Ratio，简称D/E）是衡量公司财务结构的重要指标，表示公司总负债与股东权益之间的比例。该比率反映了公司通过债务融资与股权融资的相对比例，通常用于评估公司的财务风险和杠杆水平。公式为：债务股本比 = 总负债 / 股东权益。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E) is a key metric used to evaluate a company's financial structure, representing the proportion of total liabilities to shareholders' equity. It indicates the relative mix of debt and equity financing used by a company and is commonly used to assess financial risk and leverage. The formula is: Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    债务股本比广泛应用于企业财务分析、投资决策和信用评级中。高D/E比率可能表明公司依赖债务融资，财务风险较高；低D/E比率则可能反映公司财务稳健，但可能错失杠杆收益。投资者和债权人常用此指标评估公司偿债能力和资本结构合理性。  
  - **English Application**  
    The D/E ratio is widely used in corporate financial analysis, investment decision-making, and credit rating. A high D/E ratio may indicate heavy reliance on debt financing and higher financial risk, while a low D/E ratio may suggest financial stability but potentially missed leverage opportunities. Investors and creditors often use this metric to assess a company's solvency and capital structure.
