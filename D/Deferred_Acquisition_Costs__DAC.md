# Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    递延收购成本（Deferred Acquisition Costs, DAC）是指保险公司在获取新保单过程中产生的成本，这些成本不会在发生时立即计入损益表，而是根据保单的预期收益分摊到未来的多个会计期间。这一概念由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）提出，核心在于匹配收入与成本的时间性。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) refer to the costs incurred by insurance companies in acquiring new policies. These costs are not immediately recognized in the income statement at the time of occurrence but are instead amortized over future accounting periods based on the expected revenue from the policies. This concept, introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), emphasizes the alignment of revenue and cost timing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用**  
    DAC主要用于保险行业，特别是在长期保险产品（如寿险和年金）中。保险公司在销售保单时会产生大量一次性成本（如佣金、营销费用等），这些成本通过DAC分摊到保单的整个生命周期中，以平滑财务报表的波动。需要注意的是，DAC的分摊需基于精算假设，若假设不准确可能导致财务报表失真。  
  - **English Application**  
    DAC is primarily used in the insurance industry, especially for long-term insurance products such as life insurance and annuities. When selling policies, insurance companies incur significant one-time costs (e.g., commissions, marketing expenses), which are spread over the policy's life cycle through DAC to smooth financial statement volatility. It is important to note that DAC amortization relies on actuarial assumptions, and inaccurate assumptions may distort financial statements.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，DAC有助于保险公司更准确地反映其财务状况，避免因一次性成本导致的利润波动。从投资角度看，DAC的分摊机制使投资者能更清晰地评估保险公司的长期盈利能力。从行业角度看，DAC是保险会计的核心概念之一，直接影响保险公司的财务管理和产品定价策略。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, DAC helps insurance companies more accurately reflect their financial status, avoiding profit volatility caused by one-time costs. From an investment perspective, the amortization mechanism of DAC allows investors to better assess the long-term profitability of insurance companies. From an industry perspective, DAC is a core concept in insurance accounting, directly impacting financial management and product pricing strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    DAC的概念起源于20世纪80年代，随着保险行业的快速发展，保险公司面临如何合理分摊高额保单获取成本的挑战。1982年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）发布了第60号财务会计准则（SFAS 60），正式确立了DAC的会计处理方法。这一准则的制定旨在解决保险公司财务报表中收入与成本不匹配的问题。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of DAC originated in the 1980s as the insurance industry rapidly expanded, and companies faced challenges in reasonably allocating high policy acquisition costs. In 1982, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 (SFAS 60), formally establishing the accounting treatment for DAC. This standard aimed to address the mismatch between revenue and costs in insurance companies' financial statements.

  - **中文影响**  
    DAC的引入对保险行业产生了深远影响。它不仅规范了保险公司的财务报表编制，还推动了保险产品的精算定价和风险管理的发展。如今，DAC已成为全球保险会计的通用标准，特别是在美国和欧洲市场。然而，随着保险产品的复杂化，DAC的分摊假设也面临更多挑战。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The introduction of DAC has had a profound impact on the insurance industry. It not only standardized the preparation of financial statements but also advanced actuarial pricing and risk management for insurance products. Today, DAC is a global standard in insurance accounting, particularly in the U.S. and European markets. However, as insurance products become more complex, the assumptions underlying DAC amortization face increasing challenges.
