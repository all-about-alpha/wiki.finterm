  **English Explanation**: Delisting refers to the removal of a company's stock from a stock exchange, making it no longer available for public trading. This typically occurs when a company fails to meet the listing requirements of the exchange, goes bankrupt, is acquired, or voluntarily requests delisting. Delisting can be either voluntary or enforced.

  **English Explanation**: Delisting often occurs when a company's financial condition deteriorates, violates exchange regulations, or chooses to go private.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：退市制度的起源可以追溯到20世纪初，随着股票市场的规范化发展，交易所开始制定上市和退市标准。例如，纽约证券交易所（NYSE）在20世纪30年代大萧条后加强了对上市公司的监管，退市机制逐渐成为全球资本市场的标配。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of delisting can be traced back to the early 20th century, as stock markets became more standardized and exchanges began to establish listing and delisting criteria. For example, after the Great Depression in the 1930s, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) strengthened its regulation of listed companies, and delisting mechanisms gradually became a standard feature of global capital markets.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：退市对公司和投资者都有深远影响。对公司而言，退市可能导致融资能力下降和声誉受损；对投资者而言，退市可能意味着投资损失和流动性风险。近年来，随着监管趋严，退市案例增多，市场优胜劣汰机制逐步完善。  
  **English Explanation**: Delisting has profound impacts on both companies and investors. For companies, delisting may lead to reduced financing capabilities and reputational damage; for investors, it may mean investment losses and liquidity risks.
