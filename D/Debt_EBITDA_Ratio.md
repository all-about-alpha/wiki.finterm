## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

    债务/EBITDA比率（Debt/EBITDA Ratio）是衡量公司财务杠杆和偿债能力的重要指标。它通过将公司的总债务与其息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）进行比较，反映公司用其核心盈利能力偿还债务的能力。该比率越低，表明公司偿债能力越强；反之，则可能面临较高的财务风险。

    The Debt/EBITDA Ratio is a key metric used to assess a company's financial leverage and debt repayment capacity. It compares a company's total debt to its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), indicating how well the company can service its debt using its core operating profits. A lower ratio suggests stronger debt repayment ability, while a higher ratio may indicate elevated financial risk.
