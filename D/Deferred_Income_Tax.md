# Deferred Income Tax

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  递延所得税（Deferred Income Tax）是指由于会计准则与税法在确认收入、费用或损失时的时间差异，导致企业在财务报表中确认的所得税费用与实际应缴纳的所得税金额不一致，从而产生的暂时性差异。递延所得税资产或负债反映了这些差异对未来所得税的影响。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Deferred Income Tax refers to the temporary differences between the accounting income reported in financial statements and the taxable income calculated under tax laws, resulting in discrepancies between the income tax expense recognized in financial statements and the actual income tax payable. Deferred tax assets or liabilities reflect the future tax effects of these differences.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  递延所得税常见于企业财务报表中，尤其是在处理折旧方法差异、收入确认时间差异或资产减值损失时。例如，企业采用加速折旧法计算税务折旧，而财务报表中使用直线法，这会导致递延所得税负债的产生。企业需注意递延所得税资产的确认条件，如未来是否有足够的应纳税所得额来抵扣。  
  **English Application**  
  Deferred income tax is commonly seen in corporate financial statements, especially when dealing with differences in depreciation methods, timing of revenue recognition, or asset impairment losses. For example, if a company uses accelerated depreciation for tax purposes but straight-line depreciation in financial reporting, a deferred tax liability will arise. Companies must also consider the recognition criteria for deferred tax assets, such as whether there will be sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the asset.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  递延所得税是财务报表中的重要项目，直接影响企业的税后利润和资产负债表的准确性。从监管角度看，递延所得税的合理确认和披露有助于提高财务透明度；从投资角度看，递延所得税的变化可能反映企业的税务筹划能力或未来税负压力；从行业角度看，递延所得税的处理方式可能影响企业的竞争力。  
  **English Significance**  
  Deferred income tax is a critical item in financial statements, directly impacting a company's after-tax profits and the accuracy of its balance sheet. From a regulatory perspective, proper recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes enhance financial transparency. From an investment standpoint, changes in deferred taxes may reflect a company's tax planning capabilities or future tax burdens. From an industry perspective, the treatment of deferred taxes can influence a company's competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  递延所得税的概念起源于20世纪中叶，随着会计准则与税法差异的扩大，企业财务报表中的税务处理问题日益复杂。1967年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）首次在《会计原则委员会意见书第11号》（APB 11）中系统化地提出了递延所得税的概念。此后，国际会计准则理事会（IASB）也逐步引入并完善了相关准则。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of deferred income tax emerged in the mid-20th century as the differences between accounting standards and tax laws grew, making tax treatment in financial statements increasingly complex. In 1967, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) first systematized the concept of deferred income tax in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 (APB 11). Subsequently, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) also introduced and refined related standards.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  递延所得税的引入使得企业财务报表更加准确地反映了税务影响，提高了财务信息的可比性和透明度。然而，递延所得税的复杂性也增加了企业的财务报告负担，尤其是在跨国经营中，不同国家的税法差异可能导致递延所得税的确认和计量更加复杂。  
  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of deferred income tax has made corporate financial statements more accurate in reflecting tax impacts, enhancing the comparability and transparency of financial information. However, the complexity of deferred taxes has also increased the financial reporting burden on companies, especially in multinational operations where differences in tax laws across countries can make the recognition and measurement of deferred taxes more complicated.
