# Debit Card

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  借记卡（Debit Card）是一种由银行或金融机构发行的支付工具，持卡人可以通过该卡直接使用其银行账户中的资金进行消费或取款。借记卡的核心概念是“实时扣款”，即消费金额会直接从持卡人的账户中扣除，而非像信用卡那样提供信用额度。借记卡通常与个人银行账户绑定，支持ATM取款、POS机消费、网上支付等功能。  

  **English Explanation**  
  A debit card is a payment tool issued by a bank or financial institution that allows the cardholder to directly use funds from their bank account for purchases or withdrawals. The core concept of a debit card is "real-time deduction," meaning the amount spent is immediately deducted from the cardholder's account, unlike a credit card which provides a line of credit. Debit cards are typically linked to personal bank accounts and support functions such as ATM withdrawals, POS transactions, and online payments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  借记卡广泛应用于日常消费场景，如超市购物、餐饮支付、网上购物等。持卡人可以通过ATM机取现，或在支持银联、Visa、Mastercard等网络的商户处刷卡消费。需要注意的是，借记卡的使用受账户余额限制，且部分交易可能收取手续费。此外，借记卡的安全性较高，因为消费金额直接从账户扣除，避免了信用透支风险。  

  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Debit cards are widely used in daily consumption scenarios, such as supermarket shopping, dining payments, and online shopping. Cardholders can withdraw cash from ATMs or make purchases at merchants that support networks like UnionPay, Visa, or Mastercard. It is important to note that debit card usage is limited by the account balance, and some transactions may incur fees. Additionally, debit cards offer higher security as the spending amount is directly deducted from the account, avoiding the risk of credit overextension.
