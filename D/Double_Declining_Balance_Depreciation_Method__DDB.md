# Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method (DDB)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    双倍余额递减法（Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method, DDB）是一种加速折旧法，用于计算固定资产的折旧费用。其核心概念是资产在使用初期的折旧速度较快，后期逐渐减缓。具体计算方法是：每年折旧额 = 资产账面净值 × 双倍直线折旧率。其中，双倍直线折旧率 = 2 × (1 / 资产使用年限)。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Double Declining Balance Depreciation Method (DDB) is an accelerated depreciation method used to calculate the depreciation expense of fixed assets. Its core concept is that assets depreciate faster in the early years of use and slower in later years. The specific calculation is: Annual Depreciation = Book Value of Asset × Double Straight-Line Depreciation Rate, where the Double Straight-Line Depreciation Rate = 2 × (1 / Useful Life of Asset).

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    双倍余额递减法常用于技术更新较快的行业，如电子设备、机械设备等，因为这些资产在使用初期价值下降较快。需要注意的是，该方法可能导致资产账面价值在后期低于残值，因此通常会在折旧后期转为直线法以确保账面价值不低于残值。  
  - **English Application**  
    The DDB method is commonly used in industries with rapid technological advancements, such as electronics and machinery, as these assets lose value quickly in their early years. It is important to note that this method may result in the book value falling below the salvage value in later years. Therefore, it is often switched to the straight-line method in the later stages of depreciation to ensure the book value does not fall below the salvage value.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，双倍余额递减法有助于企业更真实地反映资产价值，尤其是在资产使用初期。从投资角度看，该方法能减少企业前期的税负，增加现金流。从行业角度看，它适用于高折旧资产的管理，有助于企业更合理地分配成本。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, the DDB method helps companies more accurately reflect asset value, especially in the early years of use. From an investment perspective, it reduces tax burdens in the early years, increasing cash flow. From an industry perspective, it is suitable for managing high-depreciation assets, helping companies allocate costs more reasonably.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    双倍余额递减法起源于20世纪初，随着工业革命的推进，企业对固定资产折旧的需求日益增加。该方法最早由美国会计学者提出，旨在解决传统直线法无法反映资产实际使用价值下降速度的问题。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The DDB method originated in the early 20th century, as the Industrial Revolution increased the need for fixed asset depreciation. It was first proposed by American accounting scholars to address the limitations of the traditional straight-line method, which failed to reflect the actual decline in asset value over time.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**  
    双倍余额递减法在全球范围内被广泛应用于制造业和高科技行业。在中国，随着会计准则的国际化，该方法逐渐被更多企业采用，尤其是在需要快速更新设备的行业中。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The DDB method is widely used globally in manufacturing and high-tech industries. In China, with the internationalization of accounting standards, it has been increasingly adopted by companies, especially in industries requiring rapid equipment updates.
