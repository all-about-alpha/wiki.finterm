# Dependency Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：抚养比（Dependency Ratio）是指非劳动年龄人口（通常指15岁以下和65岁以上）与劳动年龄人口（通常指15至64岁）之间的比例。这一指标用于衡量一个经济体中劳动人口需要负担的非劳动人口的数量。抚养比通常分为老年抚养比和少年抚养比，分别反映老年人口和少年人口对劳动人口的依赖程度。  
  **English Explanation**: The Dependency Ratio is the ratio of the non-working-age population (typically those under 15 and over 65) to the working-age population (typically those aged 15 to 64). This metric is used to assess the number of non-working individuals that the working population must support in an economy. The dependency ratio is often divided into the old-age dependency ratio and the youth dependency ratio, reflecting the dependency of the elderly and the young on the working population, respectively.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：抚养比广泛应用于人口统计学、社会保障规划和经济学研究中。例如，政府可以通过抚养比来预测未来的养老金支出压力，企业也可以利用这一指标评估劳动力市场的潜在变化。需要注意的是，抚养比过高可能导致劳动人口负担加重，影响经济增长和社会稳定。  
  **English Explanation**: The dependency ratio is widely used in demography, social security planning, and economic research. For example, governments can use the dependency ratio to predict future pension expenditure pressures, and businesses can use this metric to assess potential changes in the labor market. It is important to note that a high dependency ratio may increase the burden on the working population, potentially affecting economic growth and social stability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度来看，抚养比是制定人口政策和社会保障制度的重要依据；从投资角度来看，抚养比的变化可能影响劳动力供给和消费结构，进而影响相关行业的投资价值；从行业角度来看，抚养比的变化对医疗、养老、教育等行业的发展具有重要指导意义。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the dependency ratio is a crucial basis for formulating population policies and social security systems. From an investment perspective, changes in the dependency ratio may impact labor supply and consumption patterns, thereby affecting the investment value of related industries. From an industry perspective, changes in the dependency ratio provide important guidance for the development of sectors such as healthcare, elderly care, and education.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：抚养比的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的人口统计学研究。随着工业化和城市化进程的加速，人口结构的变化引起了学者们的关注。20世纪中叶，联合国等国际组织开始将抚养比作为衡量人口结构的重要指标，并广泛应用于全球人口政策分析。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the dependency ratio can be traced back to demographic studies in the early 20th century. With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, changes in population structure attracted the attention of scholars. By the mid-20th century, international organizations such as the United Nations began using the dependency ratio as a key metric for analyzing population structures, and it has since been widely applied in global population policy analysis.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：抚养比对全球经济和社会的深远影响体现在多个方面。例如，老龄化社会的抚养比上升可能导致养老金体系压力增大，而年轻人口比例较高的国家则可能面临教育和就业压力。目前，许多国家正在通过调整生育政策、移民政策和退休制度来应对抚养比变化带来的挑战。  
  **English Explanation**: The dependency ratio has profound impacts on the global economy and society in multiple ways. For instance, an increasing dependency ratio in aging societies may lead to greater pressure on pension systems, while countries with a higher proportion of young people may face challenges in education and employment. Currently, many countries are addressing the challenges posed by changes in the dependency ratio through adjustments to fertility policies, immigration policies, and retirement systems.
