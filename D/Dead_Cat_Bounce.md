  **中文解释**  
  “死猫反弹”（Dead Cat Bounce）是一个金融术语，用于描述资产价格在经历大幅下跌后出现的短暂反弹现象。这种反弹通常是短暂的，并不能改变资产价格继续下跌的趋势。该术语源自一句俗语：“即使是一只死猫，从高处掉下来也会反弹一下。”  
  **English Explanation**  
  "Dead Cat Bounce" is a financial term used to describe a temporary recovery in the price of an asset following a significant decline. This rebound is typically short-lived and does not alter the overall downward trend of the asset's price. The term originates from the saying, "Even a dead cat will bounce if it falls from a great height."
