# Dissenters' Rights

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：异议股东权利（Dissenters' Rights）是指在公司重大决策（如合并、收购或资产出售）中，持反对意见的股东有权要求公司以公平价格回购其股份的权利。这一权利旨在保护少数股东的利益，防止其因多数股东的决策而遭受不公平损失。  
  **English Explanation**: Dissenters' Rights refer to the rights of shareholders who oppose major corporate actions (such as mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales) to demand that the company repurchase their shares at a fair price. This right is designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders, preventing them from suffering unfair losses due to decisions made by the majority.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：异议股东权利通常在公司重大重组、合并或出售资产时被触发。例如，当一家公司决定与另一家公司合并时，持反对意见的股东可以行使这一权利，要求公司以公平价格回购其股份。需要注意的是，行使这一权利通常需要遵循严格的程序和时间限制，否则可能丧失权利。  
  **English Application**: Dissenters' Rights are typically triggered during major corporate restructurings, mergers, or asset sales. For instance, when a company decides to merge with another, dissenting shareholders can exercise this right to demand that the company repurchase their shares at a fair price. It is important to note that exercising this right usually requires adherence to strict procedures and timelines; otherwise, the right may be forfeited.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：异议股东权利在保护少数股东权益方面具有重要意义。它确保了在公司重大决策中，少数股东不会因多数股东的决策而被迫接受不利条件。从监管角度看，这一权利有助于维护市场公平和投资者信心。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了一种退出机制，降低了投资风险。  
  **English Significance**: Dissenters' Rights are crucial in protecting the interests of minority shareholders.

From a regulatory perspective, this right helps maintain market fairness and investor confidence. From an investment standpoint, it provides an exit mechanism for investors, reducing investment risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：异议股东权利的概念最早可以追溯到19世纪末的美国公司法。当时，随着公司合并和收购活动的增加，少数股东的利益常常被忽视。为了保护这些股东，美国各州开始在公司法中引入异议股东权利。最早的法律案例之一是1890年的“Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.”案，该案确立了股东有权在公司决策中保护自身利益的原则。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of Dissenters' Rights dates back to the late 19th century in U.S. corporate law. At that time, as mergers and acquisitions became more frequent, the interests of minority shareholders were often overlooked. To protect these shareholders, U.S. states began incorporating Dissenters' Rights into corporate law. One of the earliest legal cases was the 1890 "Dodge v. Ford Motor Co." case, which established the principle that shareholders have the right to protect their interests in corporate decisions.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：异议股东权利的引入对全球公司治理产生了深远影响。它不仅在美国得到广泛应用，还被许多其他国家的公司法所采纳。在中国，随着公司法的不断完善，异议股东权利也逐渐被引入，成为保护中小投资者权益的重要工具。目前，这一权利在中国的上市公司和非上市公司中都有所体现，但在实际操作中仍存在一些挑战，如公平价格的确定和程序的复杂性。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of Dissenters' Rights has had a profound impact on global corporate governance. It has been widely adopted not only in the U.S. but also in the corporate laws of many other countries. In China, as corporate law continues to evolve, Dissenters' Rights have gradually been introduced as an important tool for protecting the interests of minority investors. Currently, this right is reflected in both listed and unlisted companies in China, though challenges remain in practice, such as determining fair prices and navigating complex procedures.
