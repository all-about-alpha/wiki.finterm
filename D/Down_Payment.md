# Down Payment

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  首付款（Down Payment）是指在购买大额商品（如房产、汽车等）时，买方在签订合同后支付的一部分款项，通常占总价的一定比例。首付款是买方自有资金的体现，剩余部分通常通过贷款或分期付款的方式支付。这一概念起源于信贷交易，旨在降低卖方的风险并确保买方的支付能力。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A down payment refers to an initial payment made by the buyer when purchasing a high-value item (such as real estate or a car), typically representing a percentage of the total price. It is paid after signing the contract and is usually funded by the buyer's own resources, with the remaining balance covered through loans or installment payments. This concept originated from credit transactions to reduce seller risk and ensure buyer credibility.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  首付款广泛应用于房地产、汽车等大额商品交易中。例如，在中国购房时，首付款比例通常为房价的20%-30%，具体比例受政策调控影响。首付款的支付能力直接影响买方的贷款额度和利率。需要注意的是，首付款比例过高可能增加买方资金压力，过低则可能增加贷款违约风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Down payments are widely used in transactions involving high-value items such as real estate and automobiles. For example, in China, the down payment for a home purchase typically ranges from 20% to 30% of the property price, with specific ratios influenced by regulatory policies. The ability to make a down payment directly affects the buyer's loan amount and interest rate. It is important to note that a high down payment ratio may strain the buyer's finances, while a low ratio may increase the risk of loan default.

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the down payment ratio is a crucial tool for managing the real estate market, as adjusting the ratio can either curb or stimulate housing demand.
