  逾期账户信用卡（Delinquent Account Credit Card）是指持卡人未能在信用卡账单的到期还款日前偿还最低还款额或全额还款，导致账户进入逾期状态的信用卡。逾期账户通常会被发卡机构标记为“不良账户”，并可能产生滞纳金、利息以及信用评分下降等后果。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A delinquent account credit card refers to a credit card account where the cardholder fails to pay the minimum amount due or the full balance by the payment due date, resulting in the account being classified as delinquent. Such accounts are typically flagged by the card issuer as "non-performing" and may incur late fees, interest charges, and a negative impact on the cardholder's credit score.

  Delinquent account credit cards often arise from poor personal financial management or sudden economic hardships. Card issuers typically remind cardholders of overdue payments via phone calls, text messages, or emails. If the delinquency persists, legal actions may be taken to recover the debt.
