# Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    债务收入比（Debt-to-Income Ratio, DTI）是衡量个人或家庭财务健康状况的重要指标，表示每月债务还款总额占每月总收入的比例。该指标由金融机构在评估贷款申请时广泛使用，以确定借款人的偿债能力。核心概念包括总债务（如房贷、车贷、信用卡债务等）和总收入（税前或税后收入）。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) is a key metric used to assess the financial health of an individual or household, representing the percentage of monthly debt payments relative to monthly gross income. This ratio is widely utilized by financial institutions to evaluate loan applicants' ability to repay debts. Core concepts include total debt (e.g., mortgage, car loans, credit card debt) and total income (pre-tax or post-tax).

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    债务收入比常用于贷款审批过程中，如房贷、车贷或个人贷款。银行和金融机构通常设定DTI上限（如40%），超过此限可能被视为高风险借款人。此外，DTI也用于个人财务规划，帮助借款人评估自身负债水平是否合理。需要注意的是，DTI未考虑生活开支和其他财务义务，因此需结合其他指标综合评估。  
  - **English Application**  
    The DTI is commonly used in loan approval processes, such as mortgages, car loans, or personal loans. Banks and financial institutions often set a DTI threshold (e.g., 40%), and exceeding this limit may classify the borrower as high-risk. Additionally, DTI is used in personal financial planning to help individuals assess whether their debt levels are manageable. It is important to note that DTI does not account for living expenses or other financial obligations, so it should be evaluated alongside other metrics.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，DTI是防范金融风险的重要工具，帮助监管机构评估整体债务水平。从投资角度看，低DTI的借款人通常被视为更可靠的贷款对象。从行业角度看，DTI是金融机构制定贷款政策和风险管理策略的核心指标之一。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, DTI is a crucial tool for mitigating financial risks, helping regulators assess overall debt levels. From an investment standpoint, borrowers with low DTI are generally considered more reliable. From an industry perspective, DTI is a core metric for financial institutions in formulating lending policies and risk management strategies.
