# Deferred Tax Asset

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  递延所得税资产（Deferred Tax Asset）是指企业在未来期间可以用来抵扣应纳税所得额的资产。它通常产生于企业在当前期间因会计利润与税务利润的暂时性差异而多缴纳的税款，这些多缴的税款可以在未来期间通过减少应纳税所得额来收回。递延所得税资产的核心概念是“暂时性差异”和“未来可抵扣税款”。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) is an asset on a company's balance sheet that represents taxes paid in advance or overpaid, which can be used to reduce future taxable income. It arises due to temporary differences between accounting profits and taxable profits, where taxes paid in the current period exceed the amount owed based on accounting income. The core concepts are "temporary differences" and "future tax deductions."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  递延所得税资产常见于企业财务报表中，尤其是在企业发生亏损、计提资产减值准备或存在未使用的税收抵免时。例如，当企业因资产减值而减少会计利润但税务利润不变时，会产生递延所得税资产。需要注意的是，递延所得税资产的确认需基于未来能否产生足够的应纳税所得额，否则可能无法实现其价值。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  Deferred Tax Assets are commonly found in financial statements, particularly when a company incurs losses, recognizes asset impairments, or has unused tax credits. For example, when a company reduces its accounting profit due to asset impairment but its taxable profit remains unchanged, a DTA is created. It is important to note that the recognition of a DTA depends on the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in the future; otherwise, its value may not be realized.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，递延所得税资产的确认和计量直接影响企业财务报表的准确性和透明度。从投资角度看，递延所得税资产反映了企业未来的税收优惠潜力，可能影响投资者对企业价值的评估。从行业角度看，递延所得税资产的管理是企业税务筹划的重要组成部分，有助于优化税负。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the recognition and measurement of Deferred Tax Assets directly impact the accuracy and transparency of financial statements. From an investment perspective, DTAs reflect a company's potential for future tax benefits, which may influence investor valuation. From an industry perspective, managing DTAs is a key component of tax planning, helping to optimize tax liabilities.
