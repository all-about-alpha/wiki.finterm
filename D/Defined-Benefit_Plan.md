## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  固定收益计划（Defined-Benefit Plan）是一种退休金计划，雇主承诺在员工退休后按照预定的公式支付固定的养老金。该公式通常基于员工的工资水平、工作年限等因素计算。雇主承担投资风险，并负责确保有足够的资金支付未来的养老金。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Defined-Benefit Plan is a type of retirement plan where the employer promises to pay a specified pension amount to employees upon retirement, calculated based on a predetermined formula. This formula typically considers factors such as the employee's salary level and years of service. The employer bears the investment risk and is responsible for ensuring sufficient funds are available to meet future pension obligations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  固定收益计划常见于大型企业、政府机构和公共部门，适用于希望为员工提供稳定退休保障的组织。由于雇主承担投资风险，员工无需担心市场波动对养老金的影响。然而，雇主需要定期评估养老金负债，并确保资金充足，这可能带来较大的财务压力。  
  **English Application**：  
  Defined-Benefit Plans are commonly used by large corporations, government agencies, and public sector organizations aiming to provide stable retirement benefits for employees. Since the employer assumes the investment risk, employees are shielded from market fluctuations affecting their pensions. However, employers must regularly assess pension liabilities and ensure adequate funding, which can impose significant financial burdens.

  From a regulatory perspective, Defined-Benefit Plans are heavily regulated to ensure employers meet their payment obligations. From an investment standpoint, they provide employees with stable retirement income, reducing personal investment risks.

  **中文影响**：  
  固定收益计划对全球养老金体系产生了深远影响，尤其在发达国家，它曾是主流的退休保障方式。然而，随着人口老龄化和企业财务压力增加，许多国家逐渐转向固定缴款计划（Defined-Contribution Plan）。尽管如此，固定收益计划仍在公共部门和部分企业中占据重要地位。  
  **English Impact**：  
  Defined-Benefit Plans have had a profound impact on global pension systems, particularly in developed countries where they were once the dominant form of retirement security.
