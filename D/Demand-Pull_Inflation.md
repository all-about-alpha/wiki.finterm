# Demand-Pull Inflation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **需求拉动型通货膨胀** 是指由于总需求超过总供给，导致物价水平普遍上涨的经济现象。这一概念最早由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）提出，核心在于需求过剩推动价格上涨。  
  **Demand-pull inflation** refers to an economic phenomenon where the general price level rises due to aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply. This concept was first introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes, emphasizing that excess demand drives price increases.

* **应用 / Application**  
  需求拉动型通货膨胀通常出现在经济快速增长时期，例如消费热潮、政府大规模支出或投资激增时。在中国，这可能表现为房地产市场的过热或节假日消费高峰期的物价上涨。需要注意的是，如果需求持续超过供给，可能导致经济过热和资源错配。  
  Demand-pull inflation often occurs during periods of rapid economic growth, such as consumption booms, large-scale government spending, or investment surges. In China, this might manifest as overheating in the real estate market or price increases during holiday consumption peaks. It is important to note that if demand consistently exceeds supply, it may lead to economic overheating and resource misallocation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，需求拉动型通货膨胀是货币政策调控的重要目标之一。央行可能通过加息或收紧流动性来抑制需求。从投资角度看，通胀预期会影响资产配置，投资者可能转向抗通胀资产（如黄金或房地产）。从行业角度看，某些行业（如消费品或服务业）可能因需求增加而受益，但也面临成本上升的压力。  
  From a regulatory perspective, demand-pull inflation is a key target for monetary policy adjustments. Central banks may raise interest rates or tighten liquidity to curb demand. From an investment perspective, inflation expectations influence asset allocation, with investors potentially shifting to inflation-resistant assets like gold or real estate. From an industry perspective, sectors such as consumer goods or services may benefit from increased demand but also face rising cost pressures.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  需求拉动型通货膨胀的理论起源于20世纪30年代的凯恩斯经济学。凯恩斯在其著作《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出，总需求的波动是经济周期和通胀的主要驱动力。这一理论在二战后被广泛应用于解释西方国家的经济现象，尤其是在20世纪60年代和70年代的“滞胀”时期。  
  The theory of demand-pull inflation originated in the 1930s with Keynesian economics. In his work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*, John Maynard Keynes argued that fluctuations in aggregate demand are the primary drivers of economic cycles and inflation. This theory was widely applied to explain economic phenomena in Western countries post-World War II, particularly during the stagflation periods of the 1960s and 1970s.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  需求拉动型通货膨胀对全球经济产生了深远影响。例如，20世纪70年代的石油危机期间，需求过剩与供给短缺共同推高了全球物价水平。在中国，改革开放初期的经济快速增长也曾引发需求拉动型通胀，促使政府采取了一系列宏观调控措施。如今，这一概念仍是分析经济波动和制定政策的重要工具。  
  Demand-pull inflation has had a profound impact on the global economy. For instance, during the 1970s oil crisis, excess demand combined with supply shortages drove up global price levels. In China, rapid economic growth in the early stages of reform and opening-up also triggered demand-pull inflation, prompting the government to implement a series of macroeconomic controls. Today, this concept remains a vital tool for analyzing economic fluctuations and formulating policies.
