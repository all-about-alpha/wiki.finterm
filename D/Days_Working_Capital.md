# Days Working Capital

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  营运资本天数（Days Working Capital, DWC）是衡量企业营运效率的财务指标，表示企业将营运资本转化为现金所需的天数。它反映了企业在日常运营中管理流动资产和流动负债的效率。计算公式为：  
  \[
  \text{营运资本天数} = \frac{\text{平均营运资本}}{\text{每日销售收入}} \times 365
  \]  
  其中，营运资本 = 流动资产 - 流动负债。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Days Working Capital (DWC) is a financial metric that measures the efficiency of a company's working capital management. It indicates the number of days required for a company to convert its working capital into cash. The formula is:  
  \[
  \text{Days Working Capital} = \frac{\text{Average Working Capital}}{\text{Daily Sales Revenue}} \times 365
  \]  
  Where Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.  

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  营运资本天数常用于评估企业的流动性风险和运营效率。较低的DWC值通常表明企业能够快速将营运资本转化为现金，流动性较好；较高的DWC值可能意味着企业存在库存积压或应收账款回收缓慢等问题。适用于制造业、零售业等需要高效管理库存和现金流的行业。  

  **风险提示**：  
  - 过低的DWC可能意味着企业过于依赖短期融资，存在流动性风险。  
  - 过高的DWC可能表明企业运营效率低下，需优化库存和应收账款管理。  

  **English Application**:  
  Days Working Capital is commonly used to assess a company's liquidity risk and operational efficiency. A lower DWC indicates that the company can quickly convert working capital into cash, suggesting better liquidity. A higher DWC may signal issues such as inventory buildup or slow receivables collection. It is particularly relevant for industries like manufacturing and retail that require efficient inventory and cash flow management.  

  **Risk Notes**:  
  - A very low DWC may indicate over-reliance on short-term financing, posing liquidity risks.  
  - A very high DWC may suggest inefficiencies in operations, requiring optimization of inventory and receivables management.
