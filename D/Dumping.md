# Dumping

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：倾销（Dumping）是指一国企业以低于其国内市场价格或生产成本的价格，将产品出口到另一国市场的行为。这种行为通常被视为不公平贸易行为，可能对进口国的相关产业造成损害。倾销的核心概念包括价格歧视、市场支配力以及贸易保护主义。  
  **English Explanation**: Dumping refers to the practice of exporting goods to another country at a price lower than their domestic market price or production cost. This practice is often considered an unfair trade practice and can cause harm to the domestic industries of the importing country. Key concepts include price discrimination, market power, and trade protectionism.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：倾销常见于国际贸易中，尤其是当出口国企业试图通过低价策略迅速占领进口国市场时。例如，钢铁、化工等行业常出现倾销行为。进口国政府可能会采取反倾销措施，如征收反倾销税，以保护本国产业。需要注意的是，倾销可能导致进口国相关产业受损，甚至引发贸易战。  
  **English Application**: Dumping is commonly seen in international trade, especially when exporting companies attempt to quickly capture the market of the importing country through low-price strategies. Industries such as steel and chemicals often experience dumping. Governments of importing countries may impose anti-dumping measures, such as anti-dumping duties, to protect domestic industries. It is important to note that dumping can harm related industries in the importing country and may even trigger trade wars.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，倾销是国际贸易规则中重点打击的行为之一，WTO（世界贸易组织）明确禁止倾销行为。从投资和产业角度看，倾销可能导致市场扭曲，影响公平竞争，进而损害投资者信心和产业健康发展。因此，反倾销措施成为各国维护市场秩序的重要手段。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, dumping is one of the key practices targeted by international trade rules, and the WTO explicitly prohibits dumping. From an investment and industry perspective, dumping can lead to market distortions, affect fair competition, and harm investor confidence and the healthy development of industries. Therefore, anti-dumping measures are an important tool for countries to maintain market order.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：倾销的概念最早可以追溯到19世纪末的国际贸易实践。随着工业革命的推进，欧洲国家开始大规模生产商品，并试图通过低价出口抢占全球市场。20世纪初，美国成为反倾销立法的先行者，1916年通过了《反倾销法》，旨在保护本国产业免受外国低价商品的冲击。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of dumping can be traced back to the late 19th century in international trade practices. With the advancement of the Industrial Revolution, European countries began mass-producing goods and sought to capture global markets through low-price exports. In the early 20th century, the United States became a pioneer in anti-dumping legislation, passing the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916 to protect domestic industries from the impact of foreign low-priced goods.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：倾销对全球贸易格局产生了深远影响。20世纪中后期，随着全球化进程加快，倾销行为更加频繁，尤其是在发展中国家与发达国家之间的贸易中。反倾销措施成为各国维护贸易平衡的重要手段。如今，WTO框架下的反倾销规则已成为国际贸易争端解决的核心内容之一。  
  **English Impact**: Dumping has had a profound impact on the global trade landscape. In the mid-to-late 20th century, as globalization accelerated, dumping practices became more frequent, especially in trade between developing and developed countries. Anti-dumping measures have become an important tool for countries to maintain trade balance. Today, anti-dumping rules under the WTO framework are a core component of international trade dispute resolution.
