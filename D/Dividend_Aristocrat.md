  股息贵族（Dividend Aristocrat）是指那些在至少连续25年内每年都增加股息支付的公司。这些公司通常来自标普500指数，具有稳定的盈利能力和强大的现金流，能够在经济周期中保持股息增长的记录。股息贵族被视为高质量的投资标的，因其长期稳定的股息增长反映了公司的财务健康和可持续性。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Dividend Aristocrat is a company that has increased its dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. These companies are typically part of the S&P 500 Index and are known for their stable earnings and strong cash flow, enabling them to maintain a record of dividend growth through various economic cycles. Dividend Aristocrats are considered high-quality investment targets due to their long-term, consistent dividend growth, which reflects the company's financial health and sustainability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  股息贵族通常被投资者用于构建长期投资组合，尤其是在追求稳定收益和资本保值的退休基金或保守型投资策略中。投资者可以通过购买股息贵族股票或相关ETF（如标普500股息贵族指数基金）来分散风险并获得稳定的股息收入。需要注意的是，尽管股息贵族具有较高的稳定性，但其股价仍可能受到市场波动的影响，投资者应结合自身风险承受能力进行配置。  
  **English Application**  
  Dividend Aristocrats are often used by investors to build long-term portfolios, particularly in retirement funds or conservative investment strategies that seek stable income and capital preservation. Investors can gain exposure to Dividend Aristocrats by purchasing individual stocks or related ETFs (such as the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund) to diversify risk and achieve steady dividend income. It is important to note that while Dividend Aristocrats are relatively stable, their stock prices can still be affected by market fluctuations, and investors should allocate based on their risk tolerance.

  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，股息贵族公司通常符合严格的财务标准，是市场中的优质企业。从投资角度看，它们为投资者提供了稳定的现金流和潜在的资本增值机会，尤其是在低利率环境下更具吸引力。从行业角度看，股息贵族多集中在消费、医疗和工业等防御性行业，这些行业在经济下行时表现相对稳健，因此股息贵族也被视为经济周期的“避风港”。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, Dividend Aristocrat companies typically meet stringent financial standards and are considered high-quality enterprises in the market. From an investment perspective, they provide investors with stable cash flow and potential capital appreciation, making them particularly attractive in low-interest-rate environments. From an industry perspective, Dividend Aristocrats are often concentrated in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and industrials, which tend to perform relatively well during economic downturns. As a result, Dividend Aristocrats are seen as a "safe haven" during economic cycles.
