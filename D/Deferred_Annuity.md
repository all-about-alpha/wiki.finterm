# Deferred Annuity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：递延年金（Deferred Annuity）是一种金融产品，允许投保人在未来某个特定时间点开始领取年金，而不是立即领取。投保人通常会在积累期内定期缴纳保费，保险公司将这些资金进行投资，待积累期结束后，投保人可以选择一次性领取或分期领取年金。递延年金的核心概念在于“延迟领取”，旨在为投保人提供长期的财务保障。  
  **English Explanation**: A deferred annuity is a financial product that allows the policyholder to start receiving annuity payments at a specified future date rather than immediately. During the accumulation phase, the policyholder typically makes regular premium payments, which the insurance company invests. After the accumulation period ends, the policyholder can choose to receive the annuity as a lump sum or in installments. The core concept of a deferred annuity is "deferred payment," aiming to provide long-term financial security for the policyholder.
