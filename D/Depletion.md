# Depletion

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：耗竭（Depletion）是指自然资源（如矿产、石油、天然气等）因开采和使用而逐渐减少的过程。在会计和财务领域，耗竭是一种成本分摊方法，用于将自然资源的成本在其开采周期内逐步分摊到企业的财务报表中。这一概念最早由矿业和能源行业引入，用于反映资源的有限性和开采的经济影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Depletion refers to the gradual reduction of natural resources (such as minerals, oil, and natural gas) due to extraction and usage. In accounting and finance, depletion is a cost allocation method used to systematically distribute the cost of natural resources over their extraction period in a company's financial statements. This concept was initially introduced by the mining and energy industries to reflect the finite nature of resources and the economic impact of extraction.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：耗竭主要应用于矿业、石油和天然气等资源开采行业。企业通过计算耗竭费用，将资源的原始成本分摊到每个会计期间，以反映资源的消耗情况。例如，一家石油公司会根据其油田的可开采储量，按比例分摊油田的购置成本。需要注意的是，耗竭的计算需基于资源的可开采量和市场价格波动，因此存在一定的估算风险。  
  **English Application**: Depletion is primarily applied in industries such as mining, oil, and natural gas extraction. Companies calculate depletion expenses to allocate the original cost of resources over each accounting period, reflecting the consumption of resources. For example, an oil company would proportionally allocate the acquisition cost of an oil field based on its extractable reserves. It is important to note that depletion calculations rely on estimates of extractable quantities and market price fluctuations, introducing potential estimation risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，耗竭是资源型企业财务报表的重要组成部分，确保企业合理反映资源消耗对财务状况的影响。从投资角度看，耗竭费用直接影响企业的利润和现金流，是评估资源型企业价值的关键指标。从行业角度看，耗竭方法有助于资源型企业规划长期开采策略，优化资源配置。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, depletion is a critical component of financial statements for resource-based companies, ensuring that the impact of resource consumption on financial health is accurately reflected. From an investment standpoint, depletion expenses directly affect a company's profitability and cash flow, making them a key metric for valuing resource-based firms. From an industry perspective, the depletion method helps resource companies plan long-term extraction strategies and optimize resource allocation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：耗竭的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末的矿业繁荣时期。随着工业革命对矿产资源需求的激增，矿业公司开始意识到资源的有限性，并尝试将资源成本分摊到开采周期中。20世纪初，美国会计准则逐步引入耗竭作为资源型企业成本分摊的标准方法。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of depletion dates back to the late 19th century during the mining boom. As the Industrial Revolution drove a surge in demand for mineral resources, mining companies began to recognize the finite nature of resources and sought to allocate resource costs over their extraction periods. By the early 20th century, U.S. accounting standards formally incorporated depletion as a standard method for cost allocation in resource-based industries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：耗竭方法的引入对资源型企业的财务管理和行业规范产生了深远影响。它不仅帮助企业更准确地反映资源消耗对财务状况的影响，还为投资者提供了评估企业长期可持续性的重要依据。目前，耗竭方法已成为全球资源型企业财务报告的核心组成部分。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of the depletion method has had a profound impact on the financial management and industry standards of resource-based companies. It not only enables companies to more accurately reflect the impact of resource consumption on their financial health but also provides investors with a critical tool for assessing long-term sustainability. Today, the depletion method is a core component of financial reporting for resource-based companies worldwide.
