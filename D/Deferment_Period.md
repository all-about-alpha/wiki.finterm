# Deferment Period

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  延期期间（Deferment Period）是指在贷款、保险或其他金融产品中，借款人、投保人或相关方被允许暂时停止支付本金、利息或保费的一段时间。这一期间通常由合同约定，可能是由于特定条件（如失业、疾病或教育阶段）触发。延期期间的核心概念是“暂缓支付”，但在此期间，利息或费用可能会继续累积。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The deferment period refers to a specified timeframe during which a borrower, policyholder, or related party is allowed to temporarily suspend payments of principal, interest, or premiums in loans, insurance, or other financial products. This period is typically stipulated in the contract and may be triggered by specific conditions such as unemployment, illness, or educational enrollment. The core concept is "temporary payment suspension," but interest or fees may continue to accrue during this period.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  延期期间常见于学生贷款、抵押贷款和保险产品中。例如，学生贷款在借款人就读期间可能允许延期还款；保险产品可能在投保人遭遇重大疾病时提供保费延期支付选项。需要注意的是，延期期间虽可缓解短期资金压力，但可能增加长期财务负担，因为利息或费用可能在此期间持续累积。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  Deferment periods are commonly seen in student loans, mortgages, and insurance products. For example, student loans may allow deferment while the borrower is enrolled in school, and insurance policies may offer premium deferment options in cases of serious illness. It is important to note that while deferment can alleviate short-term financial pressure, it may increase long-term financial burdens as interest or fees may continue to accrue during this period.

  **English Significance**：
