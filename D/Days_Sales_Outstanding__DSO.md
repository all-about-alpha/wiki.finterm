  应收账款周转天数（Days Sales Outstanding, DSO）是衡量企业收回销售账款所需时间的财务指标。它反映了企业从销售商品或服务到实际收到现金的平均天数。DSO的计算公式为：应收账款余额 ÷ 总销售额 × 天数（通常为365天）。该指标由财务管理领域提出，核心概念在于评估企业的应收账款管理效率和现金流健康状况。  

  **English Explanation**:  
  Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is a financial metric that measures the average number of days it takes for a company to collect payment after a sale has been made. It reflects the efficiency of a company's accounts receivable management and cash flow health. The formula for DSO is: (Accounts Receivable ÷ Total Sales) × Number of Days (typically 365). This metric originated in financial management and focuses on evaluating the efficiency of receivables management and cash flow stability.

For example, companies in manufacturing, retail, and service industries use DSO to monitor customer payment behaviors, optimize credit policies, and forecast future cash flows. It is important to note that a high DSO may indicate poor collection efficiency and potential bad debt risks, while a low DSO might suggest overly strict credit policies that could hinder sales growth.
