# Debtor-in-Possession Financing (DIP Financing)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：债务人持有资产融资（DIP Financing）是指在企业破产重组过程中，债务人（通常是破产企业）在法院的监督下，通过向债权人或第三方融资机构借款，以维持企业运营并完成重组计划的一种特殊融资方式。这种融资通常具有优先偿还权，以确保新资金提供者的利益。  
  **English Explanation**: Debtor-in-Possession Financing (DIP Financing) refers to a specialized form of financing provided to a debtor (typically a bankrupt company) during the bankruptcy reorganization process. Under court supervision, the debtor borrows funds from creditors or third-party lenders to maintain operations and execute a reorganization plan. This financing often carries super-priority status to protect the interests of the new lenders.

  **中文解释**：DIP融资主要用于破产企业的重组阶段，帮助企业在破产保护期间维持日常运营，支付员工工资、供应商款项及其他关键费用。其应用场景包括制造业、零售业等资金密集型行业。需要注意的是，DIP融资通常需要法院批准，且新债权人享有优先偿还权，可能对原有债权人的利益造成影响。  
  **English Explanation**: DIP Financing is primarily used during the reorganization phase of bankrupt companies to help them maintain daily operations, pay employee wages, supplier bills, and other critical expenses while under bankruptcy protection. It is commonly applied in capital-intensive industries such as manufacturing and retail. It is important to note that DIP Financing typically requires court approval, and new lenders often have super-priority status, which may impact the interests of existing creditors.
