# Deep In The Money

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “深度实值”（Deep In The Money）是期权交易中的一个术语，指期权合约的执行价格与标的资产的市场价格之间存在显著差异，使得期权具有很高的内在价值。对于看涨期权（Call Option），深度实值意味着标的资产的市场价格远高于执行价格；对于看跌期权（Put Option），则意味着标的资产的市场价格远低于执行价格。这种期权的价格主要由内在价值决定，时间价值占比较低。  
  **English Explanation**:  
  "Deep In The Money" is a term in options trading that refers to an option contract where the strike price is significantly different from the market price of the underlying asset, giving the option a high intrinsic value. For a call option, being deep in the money means the market price of the underlying asset is well above the strike price; for a put option, it means the market price is well below the strike price. The price of such an option is primarily determined by its intrinsic value, with little time value remaining.
