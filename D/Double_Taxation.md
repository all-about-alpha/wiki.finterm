# Double Taxation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：双重征税是指同一笔收入或利润在两个或多个税收管辖区被重复征税的现象。通常发生在跨国企业或个人在不同国家或地区开展经济活动时，由于各国税收制度不同，导致同一收入被多次征税。  
  **English Explanation**: Double taxation refers to the phenomenon where the same income or profit is taxed more than once in two or more tax jurisdictions. This typically occurs when multinational enterprises or individuals engage in economic activities across different countries or regions, leading to the same income being taxed multiple times due to differing tax systems.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：双重征税常见于跨国企业的利润分配、股息支付以及个人跨境收入等场景。例如，一家公司在A国赚取的利润在A国被征税后，其分配给B国股东的股息在B国可能再次被征税。为避免双重征税，许多国家签订了双边税收协定（DTA），通过税收抵免或豁免机制减轻税负。  
  **English Explanation**: Double taxation commonly occurs in scenarios such as profit distribution of multinational enterprises, dividend payments, and cross-border income of individuals. For example, profits earned by a company in Country A may be taxed in Country A, and the dividends distributed to shareholders in Country B may be taxed again in Country B. To avoid double taxation, many countries have signed bilateral tax treaties (DTA), which mitigate tax burdens through mechanisms like tax credits or exemptions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：双重征税问题对跨国投资和贸易具有重要影响。从监管角度看，各国通过税收协定协调税制，促进国际资本流动；从投资角度看，双重征税会增加企业成本，降低投资回报率；从行业角度看，解决双重征税问题有助于提升全球资源配置效率。  
  **English Explanation**: The issue of double taxation has significant implications for cross-border investment and trade. From a regulatory perspective, countries coordinate tax systems through tax treaties to promote international capital flows. From an investment perspective, double taxation increases corporate costs and reduces return on investment. From an industry perspective, resolving double taxation issues enhances global resource allocation efficiency.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：双重征税的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末至20世纪初，随着国际贸易和投资的兴起，跨国经济活动增多，各国税制差异导致重复征税问题逐渐凸显。1920年代，国际联盟（League of Nations）开始研究双重征税问题，并于1928年发布了《关于避免双重征税的模型协定》，为后续双边税收协定的制定奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of double taxation dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the rise of international trade and investment led to increased cross-border economic activities, highlighting the issue of overlapping taxation due to differing tax systems. In the 1920s, the League of Nations began studying double taxation and released the "Model Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation" in 1928, laying the foundation for subsequent bilateral tax treaties.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：双重征税问题对全球经济产生了深远影响。一方面，它阻碍了国际资本流动和跨国企业发展；另一方面，也推动了国际税收合作的发展。目前，全球已有数千个双边税收协定，旨在通过协调税制减轻双重征税负担。中国自1980年代以来积极参与国际税收合作，已与100多个国家和地区签订了税收协定。  
  **English Explanation**: The issue of double taxation has had a profound impact on the global economy. On one hand, it hinders international capital flows and the development of multinational enterprises; on the other hand, it has spurred the growth of international tax cooperation. Currently, there are thousands of bilateral tax treaties worldwide aimed at mitigating double taxation through tax system coordination. China has actively participated in international tax cooperation since the 1980s and has signed tax treaties with over 100 countries and regions.
