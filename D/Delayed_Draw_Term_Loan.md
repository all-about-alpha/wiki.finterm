  **中文解释**  
  延迟提款定期贷款（Delayed Draw Term Loan）是一种贷款安排，借款人可以在贷款协议签订后的一段时间内，根据自身资金需求分期提取贷款金额。这种贷款通常用于企业融资，允许借款人在特定时间内灵活使用资金，同时降低一次性提款带来的利息负担。核心概念包括分期提款、固定利率或浮动利率、以及明确的提款期限。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A Delayed Draw Term Loan is a loan arrangement where the borrower can draw down the loan amount in installments over a specified period after the loan agreement is signed. This type of loan is commonly used for corporate financing, allowing borrowers to flexibly utilize funds as needed while reducing the interest burden associated with a lump-sum drawdown. Key concepts include staged drawdowns, fixed or floating interest rates, and a defined drawdown period.

  延迟提款定期贷款常用于企业并购、资本支出或项目融资等场景。例如，企业在进行大型项目时，可以根据项目进度分阶段提取资金，避免一次性提款导致的资金闲置和利息浪费。需要注意的是，借款人需严格遵守提款期限和条件，否则可能面临罚息或贷款取消的风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Delayed Draw Term Loans are often used in scenarios such as mergers and acquisitions, capital expenditures, or project financing. For instance, a company undertaking a large-scale project can draw funds in stages based on project milestones, avoiding idle funds and unnecessary interest costs from a lump-sum drawdown. It is crucial for borrowers to adhere strictly to the drawdown schedule and conditions, as failure to do so may result in penalties or loan cancellation.
