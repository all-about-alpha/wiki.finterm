# Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “双层爱尔兰夹荷兰三明治”（Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich）是一种跨国企业用于税务筹划的复杂避税策略。该策略通过利用爱尔兰和荷兰的税法漏洞，将利润转移到低税率或免税地区，从而大幅降低企业的全球税负。其核心概念包括在爱尔兰设立两家公司（“双层爱尔兰”），并通过荷兰公司（“荷兰三明治”）进行利润转移。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The "Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich" is a complex tax avoidance strategy used by multinational corporations to minimize their global tax liabilities. It leverages loopholes in Irish and Dutch tax laws to shift profits to low-tax or tax-free jurisdictions. The core concept involves setting up two Irish companies (the "Double Irish") and routing profits through a Dutch company (the "Dutch Sandwich").

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  该策略主要被科技巨头和跨国公司采用，例如苹果、谷歌和脸书等。通过将知识产权转移到爱尔兰子公司，再通过荷兰公司进行利润转移，最终将利润汇入避税天堂（如百慕大或开曼群岛）。需要注意的是，这种策略存在法律和道德争议，且随着各国税法的完善，其可行性逐渐降低。  
  **English Application**  
  This strategy has been primarily used by tech giants and multinational corporations, such as Apple, Google, and Facebook. It involves transferring intellectual property to Irish subsidiaries, routing profits through Dutch entities, and ultimately channeling profits to tax havens like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. However, this approach faces legal and ethical controversies, and its feasibility has diminished as tax laws worldwide have been tightened.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，该策略促使各国加强国际税收合作，例如OECD推动的BEPS（税基侵蚀和利润转移）行动计划。从投资和行业角度看，它揭示了全球税收竞争的不平等性，并推动了企业社会责任（CSR）在税务透明度方面的讨论。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, this strategy has spurred international tax cooperation, such as the OECD's BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) initiative. From an investment and industry standpoint, it highlights the inequalities in global tax competition and has fueled discussions on corporate social responsibility (CSR) regarding tax transparency.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  该策略起源于20世纪80年代，当时爱尔兰为吸引外资推出了低税率政策，而荷兰则因其广泛的税收协定网络成为利润转移的中转站。1990年代，随着全球化加速，跨国公司开始大规模采用这一策略。苹果公司是最早公开使用该策略的企业之一。  
  **English Origin**  
  The strategy originated in the 1980s when Ireland introduced low-tax policies to attract foreign investment, and the Netherlands became a transit hub due to its extensive tax treaty network. In the 1990s, as globalization accelerated, multinational corporations began adopting this strategy on a large scale. Apple was one of the first companies to publicly use this approach.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  该策略对全球税收体系产生了深远影响，导致爱尔兰等国家被称为“避税天堂”。2015年，爱尔兰宣布逐步取消“双层爱尔兰”政策，并于2020年完全废止。尽管如此，其影响仍在持续，许多跨国公司转向其他避税手段。  
  **English Impact**  
  The strategy has had a profound impact on the global tax system, leading to countries like Ireland being labeled as "tax havens." In 2015, Ireland announced the phasing out of the "Double Irish" policy, which was fully abolished by 2020. Despite this, its effects persist, with many multinational corporations shifting to other tax avoidance methods.
