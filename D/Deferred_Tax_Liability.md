# Deferred Tax Liability

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：递延所得税负债（Deferred Tax Liability）是指企业在会计利润与应税利润之间因暂时性差异而产生的未来应缴纳的所得税。这种差异通常是由于会计准则和税法在确认收入或费用时的时间差异所导致的。递延所得税负债反映了企业未来需要支付的税款，是企业财务报表中的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: A deferred tax liability is a tax obligation that arises due to temporary differences between accounting profits and taxable profits. These differences typically occur because of timing discrepancies in recognizing revenues or expenses under accounting standards versus tax laws. It represents future tax payments that a company is expected to make and is a critical component of financial statements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：递延所得税负债常见于企业采用加速折旧法计算固定资产折旧时，会计上确认的折旧费用与税法允许的折旧费用不一致。此外，递延收入、资产重估增值等也会产生递延所得税负债。企业在编制财务报表时需合理估计未来税率变化，以避免高估或低估负债。  
  **English Application**: Deferred tax liabilities often arise when companies use accelerated depreciation methods for fixed assets, leading to differences between accounting depreciation and tax depreciation. Other scenarios include deferred revenue and asset revaluation gains. Companies must estimate future tax rate changes when preparing financial statements to avoid overestimating or underestimating liabilities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：递延所得税负债对企业的财务健康和税务规划具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它有助于确保企业财务报表的透明性和准确性；从投资角度看，它影响企业的估值和现金流预测；从行业角度看，它是企业税务风险管理的重要工具。  
  **English Significance**: Deferred tax liabilities are crucial for a company's financial health and tax planning. From a regulatory perspective, they ensure transparency and accuracy in financial reporting. From an investment standpoint, they impact valuation and cash flow projections. From an industry perspective, they are a vital tool for tax risk management.
