* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：股息率常用于评估高股息股票的吸引力，尤其是在低利率环境下，投资者倾向于选择股息率较高的股票以获得稳定收益。然而，高股息率并不总是意味着更好的投资机会，因为高股息可能伴随着公司增长潜力不足或财务风险较高的情况。投资者需结合公司基本面、行业前景和市场环境综合分析。  
  **English Explanation**: The Dividend Rate is often used to evaluate the attractiveness of high-dividend stocks, especially in low-interest-rate environments where investors prefer stocks with higher dividend yields for stable income.

Investors should analyze the company's fundamentals, industry outlook, and market conditions comprehensively.
