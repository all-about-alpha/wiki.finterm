# Demand Schedules

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：需求表（Demand Schedules）是经济学中用于描述在不同价格水平下，消费者对某一商品或服务的需求量的表格或曲线。它反映了价格与需求量之间的反向关系，即价格上升时需求量减少，价格下降时需求量增加。这一概念最早由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）在其著作《经济学原理》中提出，是微观经济学中需求理论的核心工具之一。  
  **English Explanation**: A demand schedule is a table or curve used in economics to describe the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing to purchase at different price levels. It illustrates the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded: as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This concept was first introduced by economist Alfred Marshall in his seminal work *Principles of Economics* and remains a cornerstone of demand theory in microeconomics.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：需求表广泛应用于市场分析、定价策略制定以及政策评估。例如，企业可以通过需求表预测消费者对价格变动的反应，从而优化定价策略。政府部门也可利用需求表评估税收或补贴政策对市场需求的影响。需要注意的是，需求表假设其他因素（如消费者偏好、收入水平等）保持不变，实际应用中需结合其他经济变量进行综合分析。  
  **English Application**: Demand schedules are widely used in market analysis, pricing strategy formulation, and policy evaluation. For instance, businesses can use demand schedules to predict consumer responses to price changes and optimize pricing strategies. Governments may also employ demand schedules to assess the impact of taxes or subsidies on market demand. It is important to note that demand schedules assume other factors (e.g., consumer preferences, income levels) remain constant, so real-world applications often require integrating additional economic variables.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：需求表在经济学中具有重要地位，它是理解市场供需关系的基础工具。从监管角度看，需求表帮助政策制定者评估市场干预的效果；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了预测市场趋势的依据；从行业角度看，需求表是企业制定生产计划和营销策略的关键参考。  
  **English Significance**: Demand schedules hold a pivotal role in economics as a foundational tool for understanding market supply and demand dynamics. From a regulatory perspective, they help policymakers evaluate the effects of market interventions. For investors, demand schedules provide insights into market trends. In the industry context, they are essential for businesses to formulate production plans and marketing strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：需求表的概念起源于19世纪末的经济学理论。阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔在其1890年出版的《经济学原理》中首次系统阐述了需求表的概念，并将其与供给表结合，形成了供需均衡理论。马歇尔通过数学和图形方法，将价格与需求量的关系直观化，为现代经济学奠定了重要基础。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of demand schedules originated in late 19th-century economic theory. Alfred Marshall, in his 1890 publication *Principles of Economics*, was the first to systematically articulate the concept of demand schedules and integrate it with supply schedules to form the theory of supply and demand equilibrium. Marshall's use of mathematical and graphical methods to visualize the relationship between price and quantity demanded laid a crucial foundation for modern economics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：需求表的概念对经济学理论和实践产生了深远影响。它不仅成为微观经济学的核心内容，还被广泛应用于全球范围内的市场分析和政策制定。如今，需求表已成为经济学教育中的必修内容，并在实际经济活动中发挥着不可替代的作用。  
  **English Impact**: The concept of demand schedules has had a profound impact on both economic theory and practice. It has become a central element of microeconomics and is widely applied in market analysis and policy-making globally. Today, demand schedules are a mandatory topic in economics education and play an indispensable role in real-world economic activities.
