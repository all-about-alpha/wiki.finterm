# Discount Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：折价债券（Discount Bond）是指以低于面值的价格发行或交易的债券。其核心特点是债券的购买价格低于其到期时偿还的本金（面值），投资者通过持有至到期获得面值与购买价格之间的差额作为收益。折价债券通常出现在市场利率高于债券票面利率时，债券价格下跌以补偿较低的票息收益。  
  **English Explanation**: A discount bond is a bond issued or traded at a price lower than its face value. The key characteristic is that the purchase price is below the principal amount (face value) repaid at maturity, allowing investors to earn the difference between the face value and the purchase price as profit. Discount bonds typically occur when market interest rates are higher than the bond's coupon rate, causing the bond price to drop to compensate for the lower coupon payments.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：折价债券常用于固定收益投资组合中，适合追求资本增值的投资者。其应用场景包括：  
  1. 市场利率上升时，现有债券价格下跌，形成折价债券。  
  2. 零息债券（Zero-Coupon Bond）是一种典型的折价债券，不支付利息，仅通过价格与面值的差额获利。  
  需要注意的是，折价债券的价格波动较大，对利率变化敏感，投资者需关注利率风险和信用风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Discount bonds are commonly used in fixed-income portfolios and are suitable for investors seeking capital appreciation. Application scenarios include:  
  1. When market interest rates rise, existing bond prices fall, creating discount bonds.  
  2. Zero-coupon bonds are a typical type of discount bond that do not pay interest but generate profit solely from the difference between the purchase price and face value.  
  It is important to note that discount bonds are highly sensitive to interest rate changes and carry risks such as interest rate risk and credit risk.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：折价债券的概念起源于19世纪的美国金融市场。当时，政府和企业为筹集资金开始发行债券，但由于市场利率波动，部分债券以低于面值的价格交易。20世纪初，随着零息债券的出现，折价债券的应用进一步扩大。1980年代，美国高利率环境下，折价债券成为投资者规避通胀风险的重要工具。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of discount bonds originated in the 19th century in the U.S. financial markets. At that time, governments and corporations began issuing bonds to raise funds, but due to fluctuations in market interest rates, some bonds traded below their face value. In the early 20th century, with the emergence of zero-coupon bonds, the application of discount bonds expanded further. During the high-interest-rate environment of the 1980s in the U.S., discount bonds became an important tool for investors to hedge against inflation risks.
