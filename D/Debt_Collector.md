  The history of debt collection dates back to ancient times, with specialized "debt collectors" existing as early as ancient Rome. The modern debt collection industry originated in Europe and the United States during the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution and the rise of credit economies led financial institutions to outsource collection tasks to specialized agencies. In the late 20th century, the industry expanded rapidly with the proliferation of consumer credit.
