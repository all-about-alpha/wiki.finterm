# Discouraged Worker

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  沮丧工人（Discouraged Worker）是指那些由于长期找不到工作而放弃寻找工作的人。他们通常因为多次求职失败或认为没有适合的工作机会而停止积极寻找工作。沮丧工人不计入官方失业率统计中，因为他们不再被视为劳动力的一部分。这一概念由经济学家提出，用于更全面地理解劳动力市场的真实状况。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A discouraged worker is an individual who has stopped looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. These individuals are typically not counted in the official unemployment rate as they are no longer considered part of the labor force. The concept was introduced by economists to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the true state of the labor market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  沮丧工人的概念常用于劳动力市场分析中，特别是在经济衰退或高失业率时期。政府和研究机构通过调查沮丧工人的数量，评估劳动力市场的健康状况。例如，在经济低迷时，沮丧工人数量增加可能表明就业市场恶化，即使官方失业率没有显著上升。  
  **English Application**  
  The concept of discouraged workers is often used in labor market analysis, particularly during economic recessions or periods of high unemployment. Governments and research institutions survey the number of discouraged workers to assess the health of the labor market. For instance, an increase in the number of discouraged workers during an economic downturn may indicate a deteriorating job market, even if the official unemployment rate does not show a significant rise.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  沮丧工人的存在对政策制定者、投资者和行业分析师具有重要意义。它揭示了官方失业率可能低估了真实的失业情况，帮助决策者制定更有效的就业政策。此外，投资者可以通过分析沮丧工人数据，评估经济复苏的潜力和劳动力市场的弹性。  
  **English Significance**  
  The existence of discouraged workers is significant for policymakers, investors, and industry analysts. It reveals that the official unemployment rate may underestimate the true extent of joblessness, aiding policymakers in crafting more effective employment strategies. Additionally, investors can assess the potential for economic recovery and the resilience of the labor market by analyzing discouraged worker data.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  沮丧工人的概念最早出现在20世纪中期的经济学研究中，特别是在大萧条后的劳动力市场分析中。经济学家发现，许多失业者因长期找不到工作而放弃寻找，导致官方失业率无法全面反映劳动力市场的真实状况。这一概念随后被纳入劳动力统计体系，成为衡量就业市场健康的重要指标之一。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of discouraged workers first emerged in economic research in the mid-20th century, particularly in labor market analyses following the Great Depression. Economists observed that many unemployed individuals stopped looking for work after prolonged job searches, leading to the realization that the official unemployment rate did not fully capture the true state of the labor market. This concept was subsequently integrated into labor statistics, becoming a key indicator for assessing the health of the job market.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  沮丧工人的概念对劳动力市场分析产生了深远影响。它促使政府和国际组织改进失业统计方法，以更全面地反映就业状况。例如，国际劳工组织（ILO）和各国统计局开始发布包括沮丧工人在内的广义失业率数据。这一概念也影响了经济学理论，特别是在解释失业率与经济增长关系时。  
  **English Impact**  
  The concept of discouraged workers has had a profound impact on labor market analysis. It has prompted governments and international organizations to refine unemployment statistics to provide a more comprehensive picture of employment conditions. For example, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and national statistical agencies now publish broader unemployment rates that include discouraged workers. This concept has also influenced economic theory, particularly in explaining the relationship between unemployment rates and economic growth.
