# Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：稀释每股收益（Diluted EPS）是指在假设所有可转换证券（如股票期权、可转换债券等）都被转换为普通股的情况下，公司每股普通股的收益。这一指标反映了公司在最坏情况下（即所有潜在稀释性证券都被行使）的每股收益水平，帮助投资者更全面地评估公司的盈利能力。  
  - **English Explanation**: Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS) represents the earnings per share of a company's common stock assuming that all convertible securities (such as stock options, convertible bonds, etc.) are converted into common shares. This metric reflects the company's earnings per share in the worst-case scenario (i.e., all potential dilutive securities are exercised), providing investors with a more comprehensive assessment of the company's profitability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：稀释每股收益常用于财务分析和投资决策中，特别是在评估公司未来盈利潜力时。它帮助投资者了解公司在所有潜在稀释性证券被行使后的盈利分配情况，从而更准确地判断股票的价值。需要注意的是，稀释每股收益通常低于基本每股收益（Basic EPS），因为它考虑了更多的股份稀释因素。  
  - **English Application**: Diluted EPS is commonly used in financial analysis and investment decision-making, especially when evaluating a company's future earnings potential. It helps investors understand the distribution of earnings after all potential dilutive securities are exercised, enabling a more accurate assessment of the stock's value. It is important to note that Diluted EPS is typically lower than Basic EPS, as it accounts for additional share dilution factors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，稀释每股收益是上市公司必须披露的重要财务指标之一，有助于监管机构评估公司的财务健康状况。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更全面的盈利信息，帮助其做出更明智的投资决策。从行业角度看，稀释每股收益是衡量公司盈利能力和资本结构的重要工具，尤其在科技和金融等依赖股权激励的行业中尤为重要。  
  - **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Diluted EPS is a key financial metric that listed companies must disclose, aiding regulators in assessing the financial health of a company. From an investment perspective, it provides investors with more comprehensive earnings information, enabling them to make more informed decisions. From an industry perspective, Diluted EPS is a crucial tool for measuring a company's profitability and capital structure, particularly in industries like technology and finance that rely heavily on equity incentives.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：稀释每股收益的概念起源于20世纪中期，随着公司资本结构的复杂化（如股票期权和可转换债券的普及），投资者和监管机构开始意识到仅依靠基本每股收益无法全面反映公司的盈利潜力。1970年代，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）正式将稀释每股收益纳入会计准则，要求上市公司在财务报表中披露这一指标。  
  - **English Origin**: The concept of Diluted EPS originated in the mid-20th century as corporate capital structures became more complex (e.g., the rise of stock options and convertible bonds). Investors and regulators realized that Basic EPS alone could not fully reflect a company's earnings potential. In the 1970s, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) formally incorporated Diluted EPS into accounting standards, requiring listed companies to disclose this metric in their financial statements.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**：稀释每股收益的引入对全球资本市场产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了财务报告的透明度，还促使公司更加谨慎地设计股权激励计划，以避免过度稀释股东权益。如今，稀释每股收益已成为全球投资者评估公司价值的重要工具之一。  
  - **English Impact**: The introduction of Diluted EPS has had a profound impact on global capital markets. It has not only enhanced the transparency of financial reporting but also encouraged companies to design equity incentive plans more cautiously to avoid excessive dilution of shareholder equity. Today, Diluted EPS is one of the key tools used by global investors to assess a company's value.
