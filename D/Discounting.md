# Discounting

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  折现（Discounting）是金融学中的一个核心概念，指将未来某一时间点的现金流或收益按照一定的折现率（Discount Rate）折算为当前价值的过程。这一概念最早由经济学家欧文·费雪（Irving Fisher）在20世纪初提出，是现代金融估值和投资决策的基础工具之一。折现的核心在于“时间价值”的概念，即今天的钱比未来的钱更有价值。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Discounting is a fundamental concept in finance that refers to the process of determining the present value of future cash flows or earnings by applying a discount rate. This concept was first introduced by economist Irving Fisher in the early 20th century and serves as a cornerstone for modern financial valuation and investment decision-making. The core idea revolves around the "time value of money," which posits that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  折现广泛应用于投资决策、资产评估、项目估值等领域。例如，在企业估值中，折现现金流法（DCF）通过预测未来现金流并折现到当前，计算企业的内在价值。在债券定价中，折现用于计算债券的现值。需要注意的是，折现率的选择对结果影响巨大，过高或过低的折现率可能导致估值偏差。  
  **English Application**  
  Discounting is widely used in investment decision-making, asset valuation, and project appraisal. For instance, in corporate valuation, the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method estimates a company's intrinsic value by forecasting future cash flows and discounting them to the present. In bond pricing, discounting is used to calculate the present value of future coupon payments and principal repayment. It is crucial to note that the choice of discount rate significantly impacts the results, and an excessively high or low rate can lead to valuation errors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，折现是金融市场的核心工具之一。它帮助投资者评估资产的内在价值，支持企业进行科学的资本预算决策，同时也为监管机构提供了评估金融机构风险的工具。折现率的设定还反映了市场对风险的预期，是宏观经济政策制定的重要参考。  
  **English Significance**  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, discounting is a cornerstone of financial markets. It enables investors to assess the intrinsic value of assets, supports businesses in making informed capital budgeting decisions, and provides regulators with tools to evaluate financial risks. The determination of discount rates also reflects market expectations of risk, serving as a critical reference for macroeconomic policy formulation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  折现的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末的经济学研究，但真正系统化并应用于金融领域是在20世纪初。欧文·费雪在其著作《利息理论》（The Theory of Interest, 1930）中首次提出了时间价值的概念，奠定了折现的理论基础。此后，折现逐渐成为金融学和投资学的重要工具。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of discounting can be traced back to economic studies in the late 19th century, but it was systematically applied to finance in the early 20th century. Irving Fisher, in his seminal work *The Theory of Interest* (1930), introduced the concept of the time value of money, laying the theoretical foundation for discounting. Since then, discounting has become a vital tool in finance and investment theory.
