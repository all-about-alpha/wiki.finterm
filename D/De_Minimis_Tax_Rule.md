# De Minimis Tax Rule

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：De Minimis Tax Rule（最低税额规则）是一项税务规定，旨在免除对极小金额的税务处理或申报义务。该规则源自拉丁语“de minimis non curat lex”，意为“法律不计较琐事”。其核心概念是，当涉及的税务金额或影响微不足道时，税务机关不会追究或要求纳税人履行相关义务。  
  **English Explanation**: The De Minimis Tax Rule is a tax provision designed to exempt taxpayers from reporting or handling tax obligations for negligible amounts. The term originates from the Latin phrase "de minimis non curat lex," meaning "the law does not concern itself with trifles." Its core concept is that when the tax amount or impact is minimal, tax authorities will not enforce compliance or require taxpayers to fulfill related obligations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：De Minimis Tax Rule通常应用于小额利息收入、资本利得或费用报销等场景。例如，在某些国家，小额利息收入（如银行账户利息）可能因金额过低而无需申报或缴税。然而，纳税人需注意，不同国家或地区的具体适用标准可能不同，且该规则不适用于所有税种或交易类型。  
  **English Explanation**: The De Minimis Tax Rule is commonly applied to scenarios involving small amounts of interest income, capital gains, or expense reimbursements. For instance, in some countries, minor interest income (e.g., from bank accounts) may be exempt from reporting or taxation due to its negligible amount. However, taxpayers should note that specific thresholds and applicability may vary across jurisdictions, and the rule does not apply to all tax types or transactions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，De Minimis Tax Rule简化了税务管理，降低了税务机关和纳税人的行政负担。从投资和行业角度看，该规则有助于鼓励小额投资和交易，促进经济活力。然而，过度依赖该规则可能导致税务漏洞，因此需在便利性和合规性之间取得平衡。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the De Minimis Tax Rule simplifies tax administration and reduces the administrative burden on both tax authorities and taxpayers. From an investment and industry standpoint, it encourages small-scale investments and transactions, fostering economic vitality. However, over-reliance on this rule may lead to tax loopholes, necessitating a balance between convenience and compliance.
