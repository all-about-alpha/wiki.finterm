## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  扣除的概念最早可以追溯到古代税收制度。例如，在中国古代，农民在缴纳田赋时，可以从总收入中扣除种子和耕牛的费用。现代扣除制度的形成则与19世纪末至20世纪初的所得税法发展密切相关。1913年，美国联邦所得税法正式确立了扣除制度，此后各国纷纷效仿。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of deduction can be traced back to ancient tax systems. For example, in ancient China, farmers could deduct the cost of seeds and oxen from their total income when paying land taxes. The modern deduction system was closely related to the development of income tax laws from the late 19th to early 20th century. In 1913, the U.S. federal income tax law formally established the deduction system, which was subsequently adopted by many countries.
