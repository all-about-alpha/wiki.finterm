# Defensive Stock

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：防御性股票（Defensive Stock）是指在经济衰退或市场波动期间表现相对稳定的股票。这类股票通常属于必需消费品、公用事业或医疗保健等行业，因为这些行业的需求在经济低迷时仍然保持相对稳定。防御性股票的核心概念在于其抗风险能力和稳定的现金流。  
  **English Explanation**: Defensive stocks are stocks that tend to remain stable during economic downturns or market volatility. These stocks typically belong to industries such as consumer staples, utilities, or healthcare, as demand in these sectors remains relatively stable even during economic downturns. The core concept of defensive stocks lies in their risk resistance and stable cash flow.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：防御性股票通常被投资者用于构建抗风险的投资组合，尤其是在经济不确定性较高的时期。例如，在经济衰退期间，投资者可能会增持食品、药品或公用事业类股票，因为这些行业的需求相对刚性。然而，防御性股票在牛市中的表现可能不如周期性股票，因此投资者需根据市场环境灵活调整策略。  
  **English Explanation**: Defensive stocks are often used by investors to build risk-resistant portfolios, especially during periods of high economic uncertainty. For example, during a recession, investors may increase their holdings in food, pharmaceuticals, or utility stocks, as demand in these sectors is relatively inelastic. However, defensive stocks may underperform cyclical stocks during bull markets, so investors need to adjust their strategies flexibly based on market conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从投资角度来看，防御性股票是资产配置中的重要组成部分，能够帮助投资者在市场波动中降低风险。从行业角度来看，防御性行业（如公用事业和医疗保健）通常具有较高的进入壁垒和稳定的现金流，这使得它们在长期投资中具有吸引力。监管机构也关注这些行业的稳定性，因为它们对经济的基本运行至关重要。  
  **English Explanation**: From an investment perspective, defensive stocks are an important component of asset allocation, helping investors reduce risk during market volatility. From an industry perspective, defensive sectors (such as utilities and healthcare) typically have high barriers to entry and stable cash flows, making them attractive for long-term investments. Regulators also pay attention to the stability of these industries, as they are crucial to the basic functioning of the economy.
