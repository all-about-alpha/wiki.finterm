# Deferred Interest

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：递延利息（Deferred Interest）是指借款人或债券发行人暂时未支付但将在未来某一特定时间点支付的利息。这种利息通常出现在某些金融产品中，如信用卡、学生贷款或某些类型的债券。递延利息的核心概念是将利息的支付时间推迟，以减轻借款人在当前阶段的财务压力。  
  **English Explanation**: Deferred Interest refers to interest that is temporarily not paid by the borrower or bond issuer but will be paid at a specific future date. This type of interest is commonly found in financial products such as credit cards, student loans, or certain types of bonds. The core concept of deferred interest is to postpone the payment of interest to alleviate the borrower's financial burden in the current period.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：递延利息常见于信用卡分期付款、学生贷款以及某些企业债券中。例如，信用卡公司可能提供“0%利息”的促销活动，但实际上利息并未免除，而是递延到促销期结束后一次性支付。需要注意的是，如果借款人未能在规定时间内还清欠款，递延利息可能会迅速累积，导致更高的财务负担。  
  **English Application**: Deferred interest is commonly seen in credit card installment plans, student loans, and certain corporate bonds. For example, credit card companies may offer "0% interest" promotions, but the interest is not waived; instead, it is deferred and must be paid in full at the end of the promotional period. It is important to note that if the borrower fails to repay the debt within the specified time, deferred interest can quickly accumulate, leading to a higher financial burden.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，递延利息的透明度和信息披露对保护消费者权益至关重要。从投资角度看，递延利息债券可能为投资者提供更高的回报，但也伴随着更高的风险。从行业角度看，递延利息产品有助于金融机构吸引客户，但同时也需要加强风险管理。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the transparency and disclosure of deferred interest are crucial for protecting consumer rights. From an investment standpoint, deferred interest bonds may offer higher returns to investors but also come with increased risks. From an industry perspective, deferred interest products help financial institutions attract customers but also require enhanced risk management.
