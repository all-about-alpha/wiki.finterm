  - **English Explanation**  
    A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) is a program that allows shareholders to automatically reinvest their cash dividends into additional shares of the company's stock.

Key concepts include dividend reinvestment, commission-free trading, and long-term capital appreciation.

Additionally, reinvested dividends are still subject to income tax, so tax implications should be considered.
