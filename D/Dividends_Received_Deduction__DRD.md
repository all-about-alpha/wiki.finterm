# Dividends Received Deduction (DRD)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    股息收入扣除（Dividends Received Deduction, DRD）是指美国税法中允许企业从其应税收入中扣除从其他公司获得的股息收入的一部分。这一政策的目的是避免对同一笔收入进行双重征税，即当一家公司从其投资的公司获得股息时，这部分股息已经在被投资公司层面缴纳了所得税，DRD允许投资公司在计算自身所得税时扣除部分或全部股息收入，从而减轻税负。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Dividends Received Deduction (DRD) is a provision in the U.S. tax code that allows corporations to deduct a portion of the dividends they receive from other corporations when calculating their taxable income. The purpose of this policy is to avoid double taxation on the same income. Since the dividends received by a corporation have already been taxed at the level of the distributing corporation, the DRD allows the receiving corporation to exclude part or all of the dividend income from its taxable income, thereby reducing its overall tax burden.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    DRD主要适用于美国企业从其他美国公司获得的股息收入。根据持股比例的不同，企业可以扣除50%、65%或100%的股息收入。例如，如果一家公司持有另一家公司20%的股份，通常可以扣除65%的股息收入。这一政策鼓励企业间的投资与合作，但也存在滥用风险，例如通过复杂的股权结构规避税收。  
  - **English Application**  
    The DRD primarily applies to dividends received by U.S. corporations from other U.S. corporations. Depending on the ownership percentage, corporations may deduct 50%, 65%, or 100% of the dividend income. For example, if a corporation owns 20% of another corporation, it can typically deduct 65% of the dividend income. This policy encourages inter-corporate investment and collaboration but also carries risks of abuse, such as using complex ownership structures to avoid taxes.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    DRD的起源可以追溯到20世纪初的美国税法改革。1913年，美国引入了企业所得税，但未对股息收入进行特别处理，导致双重征税问题。1954年，美国国会通过了《国内税收法典》（Internal Revenue Code），正式引入了DRD条款，以解决这一问题。此后，DRD的具体扣除比例和适用范围经历了多次调整，以应对经济环境的变化和税收政策的优化。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The origin of the DRD can be traced back to early 20th-century U.S. tax reforms. In 1913, the U.S. introduced corporate income tax but did not address the issue of double taxation on dividend income. In 1954, the U.S. Congress passed the Internal Revenue Code, which formally introduced the DRD provision to address this issue. Since then, the specific deduction rates and scope of the DRD have undergone multiple adjustments to adapt to changing economic conditions and tax policy optimizations.

* **影响 / Impact**

    DRD对美国企业间的投资行为产生了深远影响。它降低了企业投资其他公司的税收成本，促进了资本市场的活跃度。然而，DRD也引发了一些争议，例如企业可能通过复杂的股权结构滥用这一政策。目前，DRD仍然是美国企业税收体系中的重要组成部分，但其具体规则仍在不断调整中。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The DRD has had a profound impact on inter-corporate investment behavior in the U.S. It has reduced the tax cost of investing in other corporations and increased the activity of capital markets. However, the DRD has also sparked controversies, such as corporations potentially abusing the policy through complex ownership structures. Currently, the DRD remains a key component of the U.S. corporate tax system, but its specific rules are continually being adjusted.
