# Home Warranty

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 房屋保修（Home Warranty）是一种服务合同，通常由第三方公司提供，旨在覆盖房屋内主要系统和设备的维修或更换费用。它不同于房屋保险，后者主要针对自然灾害或意外事故造成的损失。房屋保修的核心概念是提供一种经济保障，帮助房主应对因设备老化或正常磨损而产生的维修费用。  
  **English Explanation**: A home warranty is a service contract, typically provided by a third-party company, designed to cover the repair or replacement costs of major systems and appliances in a home. It differs from homeowners insurance, which primarily covers losses due to natural disasters or accidents. The core concept of a home warranty is to offer financial protection, helping homeowners manage repair costs arising from aging or normal wear and tear of equipment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 房屋保修通常适用于二手房交易中，作为卖方吸引买家的附加服务。此外，房主在购买新房后也可以选择购买房屋保修，以应对未来可能出现的设备故障。需要注意的是，房屋保修通常不涵盖因不当使用或未进行常规维护而导致的损坏。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Home warranties are often used in the sale of pre-owned homes as an added incentive for buyers. Additionally, homeowners can purchase a home warranty after buying a new property to address potential future equipment failures. It’s important to note that home warranties generally do not cover damages caused by misuse or lack of routine maintenance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从行业角度来看，房屋保修为房主提供了一种风险管理工具，减少了因突发设备故障带来的财务压力。对于房地产行业而言，它增加了房产的吸引力，促进了交易完成。从投资角度来说，购买房屋保修可以视为一种预防性支出，有助于保护房产的长期价值。  
  **English Significance**: From an industry perspective, home warranties provide homeowners with a risk management tool, reducing financial stress caused by sudden equipment failures. For the real estate sector, they enhance property appeal and facilitate transaction completion. From an investment standpoint, purchasing a home warranty can be seen as preventive spending, helping protect the long-term value of the property.
