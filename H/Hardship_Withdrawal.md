## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 困难提款（Hardship Withdrawal）是指在某些特定情况下，允许个人从其退休账户（如401(k)或IRA）中提前提取资金，以应对紧急财务需求。这种提款通常需要满足特定的条件，如医疗费用、购房首付、教育费用或防止房屋被收回等。需要注意的是，这种提款可能会产生额外的税务和罚款。  
  **English Explanation**: A hardship withdrawal refers to the allowance for individuals to withdraw funds from their retirement accounts (such as 401(k) or IRA) prematurely under specific circumstances to address urgent financial needs.
