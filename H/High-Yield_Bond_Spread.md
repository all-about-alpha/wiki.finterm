# High-Yield Bond Spread

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **高收益债券利差**是指高收益债券（通常指信用评级低于投资级的债券，也称为“垃圾债券”）与无风险利率（如美国国债收益率）之间的差额。这一利差反映了投资者因承担更高信用风险而要求的额外回报。  
  **High-Yield Bond Spread** refers to the difference in yield between high-yield bonds (typically those with credit ratings below investment grade, also known as "junk bonds") and a risk-free rate (such as U.S. Treasury yields). This spread represents the additional return investors demand for taking on higher credit risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在金融市场中，高收益债券利差常用于评估市场风险情绪和信用环境。当利差扩大时，通常表明市场对经济前景或企业偿债能力感到担忧；反之，利差缩小则可能反映市场信心增强。投资者需注意，高收益债券虽然回报较高，但违约风险也较大。  
  In financial markets, the high-yield bond spread is often used to gauge market risk sentiment and credit conditions. A widening spread typically indicates concerns about economic prospects or corporate solvency, while a narrowing spread may reflect increased market confidence. Investors should note that while high-yield bonds offer higher returns, they also carry greater default risk.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，高收益债券利差是监测金融稳定性的重要指标；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了评估风险和回报的工具；从行业角度看，它反映了企业融资成本的变化趋势。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the high-yield bond spread is a key indicator for monitoring financial stability; from an investment perspective, it provides a tool for assessing risk and return; from an industry perspective, it reflects trends in corporate financing costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  高收益债券市场起源于20世纪70年代的美国，当时企业开始通过发行低评级债券筹集资金。1980年代，随着杠杆收购和并购活动的增加，高收益债券市场迅速扩张。迈克尔·米尔肯（Michael Milken）被认为是这一市场的关键推动者之一。  
  The high-yield bond market originated in the United States in the 1970s when companies began raising funds by issuing low-rated bonds. In the 1980s, with the rise of leveraged buyouts and mergers and acquisitions, the market expanded rapidly. Michael Milken is considered one of the key figures in its development.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  高收益债券市场的兴起改变了企业融资方式，为中小企业和高负债公司提供了新的资金来源。然而，其高风险特性也导致了多次金融危机中的大规模违约事件。如今，高收益债券已成为全球资本市场的重要组成部分。  
  The rise of the high-yield bond market transformed corporate financing by providing new funding sources for small and medium-sized enterprises and highly leveraged companies. However, its high-risk nature has also led to large-scale defaults during financial crises. Today, high-yield bonds are an integral part of global capital markets.
