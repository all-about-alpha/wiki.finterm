# High-Low Method

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **高低点法** 是一种用于成本分析的管理会计方法，通过选取历史数据中的最高点和最低点来估算固定成本和变动成本。其核心概念是利用两点之间的差异来计算单位变动成本，进而推导出固定成本。  
  The **High-Low Method** is a managerial accounting technique used for cost analysis by selecting the highest and lowest points in historical data to estimate fixed and variable costs. Its core concept involves using the difference between these two points to calculate the variable cost per unit and subsequently derive the fixed cost.

* **应用 / Application**  
  高低点法常用于企业预算编制和成本控制，特别是在缺乏详细数据时。它适用于生产规模变化较大的场景，但需注意其假设线性关系的局限性，可能导致估算误差。  
  The High-Low Method is often used in budgeting and cost control, especially when detailed data is unavailable. It is suitable for scenarios with significant production scale changes but should be used cautiously due to its assumption of a linear relationship, which may lead to estimation errors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从管理决策的角度看，高低点法为企业提供了快速估算成本的工具，有助于制定定价策略和资源分配计划。然而，其简化模型可能无法反映复杂的实际成本结构。  
  From a managerial decision-making perspective, the High-Low Method provides a quick tool for cost estimation, aiding in pricing strategies and resource allocation. However, its simplified model may not reflect complex real-world cost structures.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  高低点法起源于20世纪中期，随着管理会计学的发展而逐渐被采用。其理论基础源于对生产活动中成本行为的观察和分析，旨在简化复杂数据的处理过程。  
  The High-Low Method originated in the mid-20th century as part of the development of managerial accounting. Its theoretical foundation stems from observations and analyses of cost behavior in production activities, aiming to simplify the processing of complex data.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  该方法在制造业和服务业中广泛应用，成为企业进行短期成本预测的常用工具之一。尽管现代技术提供了更精确的分析方法，高低点法因其简单易用仍被保留在教学和实践中。  
  This method has been widely adopted in manufacturing and service industries as a common tool for short-term cost forecasting. Despite modern technologies offering more precise analytical methods, the High-Low Method remains relevant in education and practice due to its simplicity.
