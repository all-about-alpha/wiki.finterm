# Hollowing Out

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “空心化”（Hollowing Out）是指企业或经济体在全球化背景下，将核心业务或生产环节转移到成本更低的地区，导致本土产业或经济结构逐渐失去竞争力或萎缩的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家在研究制造业外迁时提出，核心在于本土经济“被掏空”。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  "Hollowing Out" refers to the phenomenon where businesses or economies relocate their core operations or production processes to lower-cost regions in the context of globalization, leading to a gradual loss of competitiveness or shrinkage in domestic industries or economic structures. This concept was initially introduced by economists studying the migration of manufacturing, with its core idea being the "emptying out" of the domestic economy.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  空心化现象常见于制造业领域，例如发达国家将工厂迁移至发展中国家以降低劳动力成本。此外，服务业也可能出现空心化，如企业将客服中心外包至海外。风险包括本土就业机会减少、技术流失以及经济结构失衡。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  The hollowing out phenomenon is commonly observed in the manufacturing sector, such as developed countries relocating factories to developing nations to reduce labor costs. It can also occur in the service industry, such as outsourcing call centers overseas. Risks include reduced domestic employment opportunities, loss of technological expertise, and economic structural imbalances.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，空心化可能导致税收减少和经济政策失效；从投资角度看，本土企业竞争力下降可能影响投资回报；从行业角度看，长期空心化会削弱产业链完整性，威胁经济安全。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, hollowing out may lead to reduced tax revenues and ineffective economic policies; from an investment perspective, declining competitiveness of domestic businesses may impact returns; from an industry perspective, long-term hollowing out can weaken supply chain integrity and threaten economic security.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  空心化的概念起源于20世纪80年代全球化加速时期。当时，美国等发达国家开始将制造业外包至亚洲新兴市场（如中国、印度），以降低成本并提高利润。这一趋势引发了经济学家对本土经济“被掏空”的担忧。代表人物包括哈佛大学教授罗伯特·赖克（Robert Reich）。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of hollowing out emerged during the accelerated globalization period in the 1980s. At that time, developed countries like the United States began outsourcing manufacturing to emerging Asian markets (e.g., China, India) to reduce costs and increase profits. This trend raised concerns among economists about the "emptying out" of domestic economies. Key figures include Harvard professor Robert Reich.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  空心化对发达国家制造业造成了深远影响，导致大量工厂关闭和工人失业。同时，发展中国家通过承接产业转移实现了经济增长和技术进步。目前，一些国家正通过政策调整（如产业回流）应对空心化问题。  
  **English Impact**：  
  Hollowing out has had a profound impact on manufacturing in developed countries, leading to widespread factory closures and worker layoffs. Meanwhile, developing countries have achieved economic growth and technological advancement by absorbing relocated industries. Currently, some nations are addressing hollowing out through policy adjustments (e.g., reshoring).
