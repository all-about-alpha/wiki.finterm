## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: Holdovers 的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的证券市场发展时期。随着交易量的增加和结算系统的复杂化，未按时交割的现象逐渐引起关注。特别是在1929年股市崩盘后，监管机构开始重视清算和结算的效率问题，Holdovers 成为重点研究对象之一。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of holdover dates back to the early development of securities markets in the early twentieth century. As trading volumes increased and settlement systems became more complex, delayed settlements gradually attracted attention. Especially after the stock market crash of 1929, regulatory bodies began focusing on the efficiency of clearing and settlement, making holdover a key research topic.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: Holdover现象对金融市场的流动性和稳定性产生了深远影响。现代清算系统通过引入自动化技术和实时监控机制，显著减少了Holdover的发生频率。然而在市场极端波动时，这一问题仍可能引发连锁反应，甚至导致系统性风险。  
  当前全球金融市场普遍采用T+2（交易日后两天）的结算周期以降低Holdover风险。
  英文影响: The phenomenon of holdover has had a profound impact on the liquidity and stability of financial markets. Modern clearing systems have significantly reduced the frequency of holdover by introducing automation technology and real-time monitoring mechanisms.

Currently global financial markets widely adopt T+2 (two days after trade date) settlement cycles to mitigate holdover risks.
