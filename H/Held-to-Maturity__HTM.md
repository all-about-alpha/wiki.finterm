# Held-to-Maturity (HTM)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：持有至到期（Held-to-Maturity，简称HTM）是一种金融资产分类方式，指企业或金融机构有意愿且有能力持有某项金融资产直至其到期日，并在持有期间不进行频繁买卖。这类资产通常以摊余成本法计量，而非按公允价值计量。HTM资产通常包括债券、定期存款等固定收益类产品。  
  **English Explanation**: Held-to-Maturity (HTM) is a classification of financial assets where an entity has both the intent and the ability to hold a financial asset until its maturity date, without frequent trading. These assets are typically measured at amortized cost rather than fair value. HTM assets usually include fixed-income products such as bonds and term deposits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：HTM资产通常适用于银行、保险公司等金融机构，用于管理长期负债或满足特定投资目标。例如，银行可能购买国债并持有至到期，以确保稳定的利息收入和本金偿还。需要注意的是，HTM资产一旦被分类，企业不得随意改变其分类，否则可能面临会计准则的处罚。  
  **English Explanation**: HTM assets are commonly used by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies to manage long-term liabilities or meet specific investment objectives. For example, a bank might purchase government bonds and hold them until maturity to ensure stable interest income and principal repayment. It is important to note that once classified as HTM, the classification cannot be changed arbitrarily without facing penalties under accounting standards.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，HTM分类有助于金融机构更清晰地反映其资产结构和风险状况。从投资角度看，HTM资产提供了稳定的现金流和较低的市场波动风险。从行业角度看，HTM资产的使用有助于金融机构优化资产负债管理，降低流动性风险。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the HTM classification helps financial institutions more clearly reflect their asset structure and risk profile. From an investment perspective, HTM assets provide stable cash flows and lower market volatility risks. From an industry perspective, the use of HTM assets helps financial institutions optimize asset-liability management and reduce liquidity risks.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：HTM的概念最早源于会计准则的发展，特别是国际财务报告准则（IFRS）和美国通用会计准则（GAAP）。20世纪90年代，随着金融市场的复杂化，会计准则制定机构开始引入更细化的资产分类标准，以应对金融机构多样化的投资策略和风险管理需求。HTM分类的提出旨在为长期持有固定收益类资产的企业提供更合理的会计处理方法。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of HTM originated from the development of accounting standards, particularly the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the 1990s, as financial markets became more complex, standard-setting bodies introduced more refined asset classification criteria to address the diverse investment strategies and risk management needs of financial institutions. The HTM classification was introduced to provide a more reasonable accounting treatment for entities holding fixed-income assets over the long term.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：HTM分类的引入对金融行业产生了深远影响。它帮助金融机构更好地管理资产负债期限错配问题，同时也为投资者提供了更透明的财务信息。然而，HTM资产的刚性分类也带来了一定的局限性，例如在市场环境变化时，企业可能无法灵活调整资产组合。目前，HTM仍然是金融机构资产负债表中的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: The introduction of the HTM classification has had a profound impact on the financial industry. It has helped financial institutions better manage asset-liability maturity mismatches and provided investors with more transparent financial information. However, the rigid classification of HTM assets also has limitations, such as the inability to flexibly adjust asset portfolios in response to changing market conditions. Currently, HTM remains an important component of financial institutions' balance sheets.
