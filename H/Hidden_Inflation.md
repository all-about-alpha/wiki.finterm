# Hidden Inflation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：隐性通胀（Hidden Inflation）是指未在官方通胀数据中直接反映出来的物价上涨现象。通常表现为商品或服务质量下降、包装缩水、成分替换等，而非直接的价格上涨。这一概念由经济学家提出，用于解释消费者实际感受到的物价上涨与官方统计数据之间的差异。  
  **English Explanation**: Hidden inflation refers to the phenomenon of price increases that are not directly reflected in official inflation data. It often manifests as a reduction in the quality of goods or services, shrinkflation (reduced package sizes), or substitution of ingredients, rather than direct price hikes. This concept was introduced by economists to explain the discrepancy between the price increases consumers actually experience and the official statistical data.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：隐性通胀常见于食品、日用品等行业。例如，消费者可能发现同一品牌的饼干包装变小了，但价格不变；或者洗衣粉的成分被替换为更便宜的原料，导致效果变差。投资者和消费者需警惕隐性通胀对购买力和投资回报的潜在影响。  
  **English Application**: Hidden inflation is commonly observed in industries such as food and household goods. For example, consumers might notice that a brand of cookies has reduced its package size while keeping the price unchanged, or that laundry detergent has been reformulated with cheaper ingredients, reducing its effectiveness. Investors and consumers need to be aware of the potential impact of hidden inflation on purchasing power and investment returns.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，隐性通胀可能导致官方通胀数据失真，影响货币政策制定；从投资角度看，它可能侵蚀资产的实际价值；从行业角度看，企业通过隐性通胀维持利润的行为可能损害品牌信誉和消费者信任。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, hidden inflation can distort official inflation data, affecting monetary policy decisions. From an investment standpoint, it can erode the real value of assets. From an industry perspective, companies maintaining profits through hidden inflation may damage brand reputation and consumer trust.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：隐性通胀的概念最早由经济学家在20世纪70年代提出，当时全球正经历高通胀和经济滞胀的困境。学者们发现，许多企业通过降低产品质量而非提高价格来应对成本压力，这一现象逐渐被定义为“隐性通胀”。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of hidden inflation was first introduced by economists in the 1970s during a period of global high inflation and stagflation. Scholars observed that many companies were responding to cost pressures by reducing product quality rather than raising prices, a phenomenon that came to be defined as "hidden inflation."

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：隐性通胀对消费者购买力和企业品牌形象产生了深远影响。例如，某些食品品牌因频繁缩减包装而遭到消费者抵制。目前，随着社交媒体和消费者权益组织的关注增加，企业面临更大的透明度和诚信压力。  
  **English Impact**: Hidden inflation has had a profound impact on consumer purchasing power and corporate brand image. For instance, some food brands have faced consumer boycotts due to frequent package reductions. Today, with increased attention from social media and consumer rights organizations, companies face greater pressure for transparency and integrity.
