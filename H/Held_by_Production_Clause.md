# Held by Production Clause

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Held by Production Clause（简称HBP条款）是石油和天然气租赁合同中的一项条款，规定只要租赁区域内的油气井持续生产，租赁合同就保持有效。该条款的核心概念是“以产续租”，即通过实际生产活动延长租赁期限，避免因未达到最低产量要求而失去租赁权。  
  **English Explanation**: The Held by Production Clause (HBP Clause) is a provision in oil and gas leases that stipulates the lease remains valid as long as the wells on the leased property continue to produce oil or gas. The core concept is "holding by production," which extends the lease term through active production, preventing lease termination due to failure to meet minimum production requirements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：HBP条款广泛应用于石油和天然气勘探开发领域，特别是在美国页岩油气开发中。它允许企业在发现商业性油气后，通过持续生产维持租赁权，而无需重新谈判或支付额外费用。需要注意的是，如果产量低于合同规定的最低标准，企业可能面临租赁终止的风险。  
  **English Application**: The HBP Clause is widely used in oil and gas exploration and development, particularly in U.S. shale operations. It allows companies to maintain lease rights through continuous production after discovering commercial reserves, without renegotiating or paying additional fees. However, if production falls below the minimum threshold specified in the contract, companies risk lease termination.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，HBP条款有助于确保资源的高效利用；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了长期稳定的收益预期；从行业角度看，它促进了油气资源的持续开发和技术创新。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the HBP Clause ensures efficient resource utilization; from an investment perspective, it provides long-term stability for returns; from an industry perspective, it fosters continuous resource development and technological innovation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：HBP条款起源于20世纪初美国的石油租赁实践。随着石油工业的快速发展，企业需要一种机制来保护其勘探投资成果。1920年代，美国德克萨斯州的石油租赁合同中首次引入该条款，随后逐渐成为行业标准。  
  **English Origin**: The HBP Clause originated in early 20th-century U.S. oil leasing practices. As the oil industry rapidly expanded, companies needed a mechanism to protect their exploration investments. In the 1920s, Texas oil leases first introduced this clause, which later became an industry standard.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：HBP条款对全球油气行业产生了深远影响。它不仅推动了美国页岩革命的成功，还被其他资源丰富的国家借鉴和应用。目前，该条款已成为国际油气租赁合同中的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**: The HBP Clause has had a profound impact on the global oil and gas industry. It not only facilitated the success of the U.S. shale revolution but has also been adopted by other resource-rich countries. Today, it is a key component of international oil and gas leases.
