# Hoarding

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：囤积（Hoarding）是指个人或企业大量购买并储存某种商品或资产，通常是为了在未来价格上升时获利，或者为了避免供应短缺。这种行为在经济学中常被视为一种市场操纵手段，可能导致价格波动和资源分配不均。  
  **English Explanation**: Hoarding refers to the act of individuals or businesses purchasing and storing large quantities of a particular commodity or asset, typically with the intention of profiting from future price increases or avoiding supply shortages. In economics, this behavior is often seen as a form of market manipulation that can lead to price volatility and uneven resource distribution.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景与风险提示**：囤积行为常见于贵金属、能源、粮食等大宗商品市场。例如，在金融危机期间，投资者可能囤积黄金以保值；在自然灾害后，居民可能囤积生活必需品。然而，过度囤积可能导致市场供需失衡，引发价格暴涨暴跌，甚至影响社会稳定。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Hoarding is commonly observed in markets for commodities such as precious metals, energy, and food. For instance, during financial crises, investors may hoard gold as a hedge against inflation; after natural disasters, residents may stockpile essential goods. However, excessive hoarding can disrupt market supply and demand, causing drastic price fluctuations and even social instability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，政府需制定政策防止恶意囤积行为；从投资角度看，了解囤积现象有助于预测市场趋势；从行业角度看，企业需合理管理库存以避免因囤积导致的资金链断裂。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, governments need to implement policies to prevent malicious hoarding; from an investment standpoint, understanding hoarding helps predict market trends; from an industry perspective, businesses must manage inventory effectively to avoid liquidity issues caused by hoarding.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **English Historical Background**: Hoarding has existed since ancient times. For example, China's "Salt and Iron Monopoly" system was designed to prevent merchants from hoarding for profit. In modern economics, during the oil crisis of the 1970s, many countries stockpiled oil due to fears of supply disruptions.
