## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：希望信贷最早由美国国会于1997年通过《纳税人减税法案》（Taxpayer Relief Act）引入，旨在通过税收优惠支持低收入家庭子女接受高等教育。该政策的提出者认为，教育是打破贫困循环的关键，因此希望通过财政手段鼓励更多学生完成大学学业。  
  **English Origin**: The Hope Credit was first introduced by the U.S. Congress in 1997 through the Taxpayer Relief Act, aiming to support children from low-income families in pursuing higher education through tax incentives. The proponents of this policy believed that education was key to breaking the cycle of poverty and thus sought to encourage more students to complete college through fiscal measures.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：自实施以来，希望信贷显著提高了低收入家庭子女的大学入学率，并在一定程度上缩小了教育差距。然而，随着时间推移，该政策逐渐被美国机会税收抵免（American Opportunity Tax Credit）所取代，后者提供了更广泛的覆盖范围和更高的抵免额度。尽管如此，希望信贷为后续教育税收优惠政策奠定了基础。  
  **English Impact**: Since its implementation, the Hope Credit has significantly increased college enrollment rates among children from low-income families and has somewhat narrowed educational disparities. However, over time, this policy has been largely replaced by the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which offers broader coverage and higher credit amounts. Nevertheless, the Hope Credit laid the groundwork for subsequent educational tax incentive policies.
