# Halloween Indicator

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：万圣节指标（Halloween Indicator），又称“万圣节效应”，是一种股市季节性现象，指在每年10月31日（万圣节）至次年4月30日期间，股市通常表现较好，而在5月1日至10月30日期间表现较差。这一现象最早由学者Bouman和Jacobsen在2002年提出，基于对全球多个股市的历史数据分析。  
  **English Explanation**: The Halloween Indicator, also known as the "Halloween Effect," is a seasonal stock market phenomenon suggesting that stock markets tend to perform better between October 31 (Halloween) and April 30, and underperform between May 1 and October 30. This phenomenon was first identified by scholars Bouman and Jacobsen in 2002, based on historical data analysis of multiple global stock markets.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：万圣节指标常被投资者用于制定季节性投资策略。例如，投资者可能在万圣节前后增加股票持仓，而在5月前后减少持仓。然而，这一策略并非绝对有效，需结合宏观经济、市场情绪等因素综合判断。此外，过度依赖季节性指标可能忽略长期投资价值，增加投资风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The Halloween Indicator is often used by investors to develop seasonal investment strategies. For instance, investors may increase their stock holdings around Halloween and reduce them around May. However, this strategy is not foolproof and requires consideration of macroeconomic conditions, market sentiment, and other factors. Over-reliance on seasonal indicators may also overlook long-term investment value and increase risks.
