# High-Water Mark

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **高水位线**（High-Water Mark）是投资管理中的一个术语，指基金或投资组合在特定时间段内达到的最高净值。它通常用于计算绩效费，确保基金经理只有在超过历史最高净值时才能收取费用。  
  **High-Water Mark** is a term in investment management referring to the highest net asset value (NAV) that a fund or portfolio has achieved over a specific period. It is commonly used to calculate performance fees, ensuring that fund managers are only compensated when they exceed the historical peak value.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在私募基金和对冲基金中，高水位线被广泛用于绩效费的计算。例如，如果某基金的净值从100元涨到150元后又跌至120元，基金经理只有在净值超过150元时才能收取绩效费。这有助于保护投资者利益，防止基金经理在未创造新收益的情况下重复收费。  
  In private equity and hedge funds, the high-water mark is widely used to calculate performance fees. For example, if a fund’s NAV rises from $100 to $150 and then falls to $120, the fund manager can only charge a performance fee when the NAV exceeds $150. This protects investors by preventing managers from charging fees without generating new profits.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  高水位线机制在金融监管和投资者保护中具有重要意义。它激励基金经理追求长期稳定收益，而非短期波动，同时减少投资者的潜在损失风险。此外，它也是评估基金经理绩效的重要指标之一。  
  The high-water mark mechanism is significant in financial regulation and investor protection. It incentivizes fund managers to pursue long-term stable returns rather than short-term fluctuations while reducing potential losses for investors. Additionally, it serves as an important metric for evaluating fund manager performance.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  高水位线的概念起源于20世纪中期的对冲基金行业。随着对冲基金的兴起，投资者对透明和公平的收费机制需求增加，高水位线应运而生。它最早由美国的一些知名对冲基金采用，并逐渐成为行业标准。  
  The concept of the high-water mark originated in the mid-20th century hedge fund industry. As hedge funds grew, investors demanded more transparent and fair fee structures, leading to the adoption of the high-water mark. It was first implemented by prominent U.S. hedge funds and gradually became an industry standard.
