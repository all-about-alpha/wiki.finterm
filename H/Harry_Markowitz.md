# Harry Markowitz

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  哈里·马科维茨（Harry Markowitz）是现代投资组合理论（Modern Portfolio Theory, MPT）的创始人，被誉为“现代投资组合理论之父”。他于1952年发表了题为《投资组合选择》的论文，提出了通过分散投资来降低风险的核心概念。马科维茨的理论强调，投资者不应仅关注单一资产的收益和风险，而应通过构建多样化的投资组合，在给定风险水平下最大化收益，或在给定收益水平下最小化风险。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Harry Markowitz is the founder of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and is often referred to as the "father of modern portfolio theory." In 1952, he published a seminal paper titled "Portfolio Selection," which introduced the core concept of reducing risk through diversification. Markowitz's theory emphasizes that investors should not focus solely on the return and risk of individual assets but should instead construct diversified portfolios to maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  马科维茨的理论广泛应用于资产配置、基金管理和个人理财等领域。投资者可以通过计算资产之间的协方差和预期收益，构建有效前沿（Efficient Frontier），从而选择最优投资组合。然而，该理论假设市场是有效的，且投资者是理性的，实际应用中需注意市场波动、数据误差以及投资者行为偏差等风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Markowitz's theory is widely applied in asset allocation, fund management, and personal finance. Investors can construct the Efficient Frontier by calculating the covariance and expected returns of assets, thereby selecting optimal portfolios. However, the theory assumes market efficiency and rational investor behavior. In practice, risks such as market volatility, data inaccuracies, and behavioral biases must be considered.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  马科维茨的理论对金融行业产生了深远影响，为资产定价、风险管理和投资决策提供了科学依据。从监管角度看，该理论推动了资本市场的规范化发展；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者实现风险与收益的平衡；从行业角度看，它奠定了现代金融工程和量化投资的基础。  
  **English Significance**  
  Markowitz's theory has had a profound impact on the financial industry, providing a scientific basis for asset pricing, risk management, and investment decision-making. From a regulatory perspective, it has promoted the standardization of capital markets. From an investment perspective, it helps investors balance risk and return. From an industry perspective, it laid the foundation for modern financial engineering and quantitative investing.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  哈里·马科维茨于1952年在《金融学杂志》（Journal of Finance）上发表了《投资组合选择》一文，标志着现代投资组合理论的诞生。当时，马科维茨正在芝加哥大学攻读博士学位，他的研究灵感来源于对股票市场波动性的观察。他首次将数学方法引入投资分析，提出了均值-方差模型（Mean-Variance Model），为后来的资本资产定价模型（CAPM）和有效市场假说（EMH）奠定了基础。  
  **English Origin**  
  Harry Markowitz published his groundbreaking paper "Portfolio Selection" in the Journal of Finance in 1952, marking the birth of Modern Portfolio Theory. At the time, Markowitz was pursuing his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, and his research was inspired by observations of stock market volatility. He was the first to introduce mathematical methods into investment analysis, proposing the Mean-Variance Model, which laid the groundwork for later developments such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  马科维茨的理论彻底改变了投资领域的研究和实践方式。它不仅推动了金融学的学术发展，还深刻影响了全球资本市场的运作模式。如今，投资组合优化已成为资产管理行业的核心工具，广泛应用于共同基金、对冲基金和养老金管理等领域。马科维茨因其贡献于1990年获得诺贝尔经济学奖。  
  **English Impact**  
  Markowitz's theory revolutionized the way investment research and practice are conducted. It not only advanced academic finance but also profoundly influenced the operation of global capital markets. Today, portfolio optimization is a core tool in the asset management industry, widely used in mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension fund management. Markowitz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 for his contributions.
