# HODL

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    HODL 是一个源自加密货币社区的网络俚语，最初是由于拼写错误而产生的。它指的是在加密货币市场中长期持有资产，而不是频繁交易。HODL 的核心概念是“持有不放”，即无论市场如何波动，投资者都坚持不卖出自己的加密货币。这一策略通常与“买入并持有”（Buy and Hold）的投资理念相似，但在加密货币领域，HODL 更强调对市场波动的忍耐和对未来价值的信心。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    HODL is a slang term originating from the cryptocurrency community, initially stemming from a typo. It refers to the strategy of holding onto cryptocurrency assets for the long term rather than engaging in frequent trading. The core concept of HODL is "hold on for dear life," meaning that investors refuse to sell their cryptocurrencies regardless of market fluctuations. This strategy is often compared to the "buy and hold" investment philosophy, but in the cryptocurrency world, HODL emphasizes resilience against market volatility and confidence in future value.
