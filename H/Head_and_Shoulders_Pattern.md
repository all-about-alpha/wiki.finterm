# Head and Shoulders Pattern

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：头肩顶形态（Head and Shoulders Pattern）是一种经典的技术分析图表形态，通常出现在价格走势的顶部，预示着市场趋势可能由上涨转为下跌。该形态由三个部分组成：左肩（Left Shoulder）、头部（Head）和右肩（Right Shoulder），其中头部是价格最高点，左右肩分别位于头部的两侧，且高度相近。颈线（Neckline）是连接左肩和右肩低点的水平线，突破颈线通常被视为趋势反转的信号。  
  **English Explanation**: The Head and Shoulders Pattern is a classic technical analysis chart pattern that typically appears at the top of a price trend, signaling a potential reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend. The pattern consists of three parts: the left shoulder, the head, and the right shoulder. The head represents the highest price point, while the left and right shoulders are located on either side of the head and are of similar height. The neckline, a horizontal line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulders, is considered a key level. A break below the neckline is often interpreted as a confirmation of a trend reversal.
