# Hobby Loss

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: “Hobby Loss”是指个人从事的某项活动虽然产生亏损，但被税务机关认定为“爱好”而非“商业活动”，因此相关亏损不能用于抵税。这一概念源自美国税法，核心在于区分个人爱好与真正的商业行为。  
  **English Explanation**: “Hobby Loss” refers to losses incurred from an activity that the tax authorities classify as a “hobby” rather than a “business,” making the losses non-deductible for tax purposes. This concept originates from U.S. tax law and focuses on distinguishing between personal hobbies and genuine business activities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 例如，某人经营一个小型农场或艺术工作室，但长期亏损。如果税务机关认为其缺乏盈利意图或未采取商业化运营措施，可能将其认定为“爱好”，相关亏损无法抵税。需注意保留商业计划、财务记录等证据以证明活动的商业性质。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: For instance, if someone operates a small farm or art studio but consistently incurs losses, the tax authorities may classify it as a “hobby” if they deem it lacks profit motive or commercial operation. It’s crucial to maintain business plans, financial records, and other evidence to prove the activity’s commercial nature.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从税务监管角度看，“Hobby Loss”规则防止个人通过伪装成商业活动的爱好来逃避税收。对投资者和从业者而言，明确区分爱好与商业活动有助于合理规划税务和财务策略。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the “Hobby Loss” rule prevents individuals from evading taxes by disguising hobbies as business activities. For investors and practitioners, clearly distinguishing between hobbies and businesses aids in effective tax and financial planning.
