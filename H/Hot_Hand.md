# Hot Hand

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  “热手效应”（Hot Hand）是一个源自行为金融学的概念，指在连续成功或表现优异后，个体或实体在未来继续取得成功的概率似乎更高的现象。这一概念最初由心理学家托马斯·吉洛维奇（Thomas Gilovich）等人在1985年提出，基于对篮球运动员投篮命中率的研究。核心观点是，人们倾向于认为成功会延续，尽管统计上可能并不支持这一结论。  
  **English Explanation**:  
  The "Hot Hand" is a concept from behavioral finance that refers to the phenomenon where an individual or entity appears to have a higher probability of continued success after a streak of successful performances. This term was first introduced by psychologists Thomas Gilovich and others in 1985, based on studies of basketball players' shooting accuracy. The core idea is that people tend to believe success will continue, even though statistically this may not be the case.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  在投资领域，“热手效应”常被用来解释投资者对连续盈利的股票或基金经理的过度追捧。例如，某基金经理连续几年业绩优异，投资者可能认为其未来表现也会同样出色，从而大量买入其管理的基金。然而，这种效应可能导致投资决策偏差，忽视市场风险和统计规律。  
  **English Application**:  
  In investing, the "Hot Hand" effect is often used to explain investors' overconfidence in stocks or fund managers with consecutive strong performances. For instance, if a fund manager has delivered exceptional returns for several years, investors may assume future performance will be equally strong and heavily invest in their funds. However, this effect can lead to biased decision-making, ignoring market risks and statistical realities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管和投资角度来看，“热手效应”提醒投资者避免盲目跟风，理性分析市场数据。对于行业而言，理解这一效应有助于设计更科学的激励机制和风险管理策略。此外，它也为行为金融学的研究提供了重要案例，揭示了人类心理对经济决策的影响。  
  **English Significance**:  
  From regulatory and investment perspectives, the "Hot Hand" effect serves as a reminder for investors to avoid herd behavior and analyze market data rationally. For the industry, understanding this phenomenon helps design more scientific incentive mechanisms and risk management strategies. Additionally, it provides a critical case study for behavioral finance, highlighting the impact of human psychology on economic decision-making.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  1985年，心理学家托马斯·吉洛维奇、罗伯特·瓦隆（Robert Vallone）和阿莫斯·特沃斯基（Amos Tversky）发表了一篇关于篮球运动员投篮命中率的研究论文。他们发现球迷和球员普遍相信“热手效应”，即连续命中后下一次投篮更可能成功。然而，统计分析表明这种信念缺乏科学依据。这一研究成为行为金融学的经典案例之一。  
  **English Origin**:  
  In 1985, psychologists Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone, and Amos Tversky published a seminal paper on basketball players' shooting accuracy. They found that fans and players widely believed in the "Hot Hand" effect—that a player is more likely to make a shot after a streak of successful attempts. However, statistical analysis showed this belief lacked scientific support. This study became one of the foundational cases in behavioral finance.
