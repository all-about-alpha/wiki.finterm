## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

  A **High-Ratio Loan** is a loan where the loan amount represents a high percentage of the value of the collateral, typically exceeding 80%. Such loans are common in home purchases or asset acquisitions, where borrowers pay a lower down payment but face higher interest rates and risks.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，高比率贷款常用于首次购房者或资金不足的投资者。由于首付比例低，借款人需注意利率波动和还款压力，同时银行会要求购买抵押贷款保险以降低风险。  
  In China, high-ratio loans are often used by first-time homebuyers or investors with limited funds. Due to the low down payment, borrowers need to be aware of interest rate fluctuations and repayment pressures, while banks may require mortgage insurance to mitigate risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，高比率贷款增加了金融系统的杠杆风险，因此中国监管部门对其有严格的审批和风险管理要求。从投资角度看，这类贷款为资金有限的群体提供了购房机会，但也可能加剧市场泡沫。  
  From a regulatory perspective, high-ratio loans increase leverage risks in the financial system, leading to strict approval and risk management requirements in China. From an investment perspective, such loans provide home-buying opportunities for those with limited funds but may also exacerbate market bubbles.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  高比率贷款的起源可追溯到20世纪中期的美国住房市场。当时为了促进住房消费，金融机构开始提供低首付的房贷产品。2008年次贷危机后，全球对高比率贷款的监管趋严。  
  The origin of high-ratio loans can be traced back to the mid-20th century U.S. housing market. To promote housing consumption, financial institutions began offering low-down-payment mortgage products. After the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, global regulation of high-ratio loans became stricter.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，高比率贷款推动了房地产市场的快速发展，但也带来了家庭债务上升和金融风险积累的问题。目前，中国通过限购政策和首付比例调整来平衡市场供需与风险控制。  
  In China, high-ratio loans have driven rapid development in the real estate market but have also led to rising household debt and financial risk accumulation. Currently, China balances market supply and demand with risk control through purchase restrictions and down payment adjustments.
