  **中文解释**: 敌意收购（Hostile Bid）是指收购方在未经目标公司管理层或董事会同意的情况下，直接向目标公司的股东提出收购要约，试图通过购买足够数量的股份来获得控制权。这种收购方式通常伴随着激烈的对抗和策略性操作。  
  **English Explanation**: A hostile bid refers to an acquisition attempt where the acquiring party directly approaches the shareholders of the target company without the consent of its management or board of directors, aiming to gain control by purchasing a sufficient number of shares. This type of acquisition is often marked by intense opposition and strategic maneuvers.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 敌意收购常见于资本市场中，尤其是当目标公司管理层拒绝被收购时。收购方可能通过公开市场购买股份、发起代理权争夺或提出高价要约等方式实施。风险包括目标公司的反收购措施、法律诉讼以及市场不确定性。  
  **English Explanation**: Hostile bids are common in capital markets, particularly when the target company's management resists acquisition.
