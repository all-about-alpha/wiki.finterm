# Hindsight Bias

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **后见之明偏差** 是一种认知偏差，指人们在事件发生后，倾向于认为事件的结果是显而易见的或可预测的，尽管在事件发生前并不具备这样的认知。这一概念由心理学家巴鲁克·菲施霍夫（Baruch Fischhoff）在1975年首次提出。  
  **Hindsight Bias** is a cognitive bias where people tend to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they actually were before the events occurred. This concept was first introduced by psychologist Baruch Fischhoff in 1975.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在金融投资中，后见之明偏差可能导致投资者高估自己的预测能力，从而忽视市场的不确定性。例如，股市大跌后，投资者可能会认为这是“显而易见”的，而忽略了事前无法准确预测的事实。这种偏差可能导致过度自信和错误的决策。  
  In financial investing, hindsight bias can lead investors to overestimate their predictive abilities, thereby ignoring market uncertainties. For instance, after a stock market crash, investors might view the event as "obvious," disregarding the fact that it was unpredictable beforehand. This bias can result in overconfidence and poor decision-making.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和投资角度来看，理解后见之明偏差有助于制定更合理的风险评估和决策流程。在金融行业中，识别和纠正这种偏差可以提高投资策略的科学性和有效性。  
  From regulatory and investment perspectives, understanding hindsight bias helps in formulating more rational risk assessment and decision-making processes. In the financial industry, identifying and correcting this bias can enhance the scientific rigor and effectiveness of investment strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  后见之明偏差的概念最早由心理学家巴鲁克·菲施霍夫在1975年提出。他通过一系列实验发现，人们在得知事件结果后，会倾向于调整自己的记忆和判断，使其与已知结果一致。这一发现为后续的认知心理学研究奠定了基础。  
  The concept of hindsight bias was first introduced by psychologist Baruch Fischhoff in 1975. Through a series of experiments, he discovered that people tend to adjust their memories and judgments to align with known outcomes after learning the results of an event. This finding laid the groundwork for subsequent research in cognitive psychology.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  后见之明偏差在金融、法律、医疗等多个领域都有广泛影响。例如，在法律判决中，陪审员可能会因为知道案件结果而高估证据的明显性；在医疗诊断中，医生可能会因为知道患者最终病情而低估诊断的难度。这种偏差在全球范围内都受到关注和研究。  
  Hindsight bias has widespread implications in various fields such as finance, law, and medicine. For example, in legal judgments, jurors might overestimate the obviousness of evidence because they know the case outcome; in medical diagnosis, doctors might underestimate diagnostic difficulty because they know the patient's final condition. This bias is globally recognized and studied.
