* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 敌意收购要约常见于资本市场中，尤其是当目标公司管理层拒绝友好协商时。收购方可能通过公开市场购买股份、发起代理权争夺或提出高价要约等方式实施。风险包括目标公司采取反收购措施（如“毒丸计划”）、法律诉讼或市场波动。  
  **English Explanation**: Hostile takeover bids are common in capital markets, especially when the target company's management refuses friendly negotiations.
