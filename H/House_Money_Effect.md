# House Money Effect

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：House Money Effect（赌场资金效应）是指投资者在获得意外收益后，倾向于采取更高风险的投资行为，因为他们将这些收益视为“赌场的钱”而非自己的本金。这一概念由行为金融学家理查德·塞勒（Richard Thaler）提出，核心在于心理账户（Mental Accounting）和风险偏好的变化。  
  **English Explanation**: The House Money Effect refers to the tendency of investors to take on higher-risk investments after experiencing unexpected gains, as they perceive these gains as "house money" rather than their own capital. This concept was introduced by behavioral economist Richard Thaler and revolves around the ideas of mental accounting and shifts in risk appetite.

* **应用 / Application**

  **English Application**: In investment contexts, the House Money Effect is often observed in stock markets, futures trading, or gambling scenarios. For instance, after achieving short-term high returns in the stock market, investors might allocate a portion of their profits to higher-risk assets.
