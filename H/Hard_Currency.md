## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  硬通货的概念起源于20世纪初的国际贸易发展时期。随着全球化的推进，各国对稳定货币的需求增加，美元因其与黄金挂钩的布雷顿森林体系而成为最早的硬通货之一。1971年布雷顿森林体系解体后，美元仍凭借美国的经济实力保持其地位。  
  The concept of hard currency emerged during the early 20th century with the growth of international trade. As globalization advanced, the need for stable currencies increased. The US dollar became one of the earliest hard currencies due to its link to gold under the Bretton Woods system. After the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971, the dollar maintained its status due to the economic strength of the United States.
