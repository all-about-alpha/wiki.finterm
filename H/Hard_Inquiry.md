# Hard Inquiry

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：硬查询（Hard Inquiry）是指当金融机构（如银行、信用卡公司或贷款机构）在审核个人信用申请时，向信用报告机构（如中国人民银行征信中心）正式查询申请人信用记录的行为。这种查询通常发生在申请信用卡、贷款或抵押等金融产品时，会记录在个人信用报告中，并可能对信用评分产生短期负面影响。  
  **English Explanation**: A hard inquiry, also known as a hard pull, occurs when a financial institution (such as a bank, credit card company, or lender) formally requests to review an individual's credit report from a credit bureau (e.g., Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion) as part of the application process for credit products like loans, credit cards, or mortgages. This type of inquiry is recorded on the individual's credit report and may temporarily lower their credit score.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：硬查询主要应用于个人申请信用卡、贷款、房贷等金融产品时。金融机构通过硬查询评估申请人的信用风险。需要注意的是，频繁的硬查询可能会让金融机构认为申请人存在较高的财务压力或过度借贷的风险，从而影响审批结果。  
  **English Application**: Hard inquiries are primarily used when individuals apply for financial products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. Lenders use hard inquiries to assess the applicant's credit risk. It is important to note that multiple hard inquiries within a short period may signal to lenders that the applicant is under financial stress or overextending their borrowing capacity, potentially affecting approval decisions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，硬查询是金融机构合规操作的重要环节，确保信贷决策基于真实、全面的信用信息。从投资和行业角度看，硬查询机制有助于维护信贷市场的透明度和公平性，防止过度借贷和信用泡沫的产生。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, hard inquiries are a critical component of ensuring that financial institutions make compliant and informed lending decisions based on accurate and comprehensive credit information. From an investment and industry standpoint, the hard inquiry mechanism helps maintain transparency and fairness in the credit market by preventing overborrowing and the formation of credit bubbles.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：硬查询的概念起源于20世纪中后期，随着现代信用评分体系的建立而逐步完善。美国Fair Isaac Corporation（FICO）在1989年推出的FICO评分模型首次将硬查询纳入信用评分的计算因素之一，以更全面地反映个人的信用行为。中国则在2006年正式建立全国统一的征信系统后引入类似机制。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of hard inquiries emerged in the mid-to-late 20th century alongside the development of modern credit scoring systems. The FICO score model introduced by Fair Isaac Corporation in 1989 was among the first to incorporate hard inquiries as a factor in calculating credit scores to provide a more comprehensive assessment of an individual's credit behavior. In China, similar mechanisms were introduced after the establishment of a nationwide unified credit reporting system in 2006.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：硬查询机制的引入显著提升了信贷市场的风险管理能力，帮助金融机构更准确地评估借款人的还款能力。同时，它也促使消费者更加关注自身的信用行为，避免不必要的信贷申请。目前，全球主要经济体均已将硬查询作为信用评估的重要工具之一。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of hard inquiries has significantly enhanced risk management capabilities in the credit market by enabling financial institutions to more accurately assess borrowers' repayment capacity.
