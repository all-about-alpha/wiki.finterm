# Hostile Takeover

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：敌意收购（Hostile Takeover）是指收购方在未经目标公司管理层或董事会同意的情况下，直接通过公开市场购买目标公司股份或发起要约收购，以取得目标公司控制权的行为。其核心在于“敌意”，即收购行为不受目标公司管理层的欢迎，通常伴随着激烈的对抗和防御措施。  
  **English Explanation**: A hostile takeover refers to the acquisition of a target company by a bidder without the consent of the target's management or board of directors. This is typically achieved by purchasing shares directly in the open market or launching a tender offer to gain control. The term "hostile" emphasizes the lack of cooperation from the target company, often leading to intense resistance and defensive measures.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：敌意收购常见于资本市场活跃的国家或地区，如美国、英国等。收购方通常通过大量购买目标公司股票或发起公开要约，迫使目标公司接受收购。目标公司管理层可能会采取“毒丸计划”（Poison Pill）、“金色降落伞”（Golden Parachute）等反收购措施。风险包括市场波动、法律纠纷以及收购失败导致的财务损失。  
  **English Application**: Hostile takeovers are prevalent in regions with active capital markets, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The acquirer typically purchases a significant portion of the target's shares or launches a public tender offer to force the target into submission. The target's management may employ defensive tactics like "poison pills" or "golden parachutes." Risks include market volatility, legal disputes, and financial losses if the takeover fails.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，敌意收购有助于优化资源配置，推动公司治理改善；从投资角度看，可能为股东带来短期收益，但也可能引发市场不确定性；从行业角度看，敌意收购可能加速行业整合，但也可能导致垄断或资源浪费。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, hostile takeovers can optimize resource allocation and improve corporate governance. From an investment standpoint, they may offer short-term gains for shareholders but also create market uncertainty. From an industry perspective, hostile takeovers can accelerate consolidation but may also lead to monopolies or resource inefficiencies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：敌意收购的概念起源于20世纪中期的美国。1950年代至1960年代，随着资本市场的发展和公司股权的分散，敌意收购逐渐成为一种常见的商业策略。著名的案例包括1988年KKR对RJR Nabisco的收购，这一事件被记录在《门口的野蛮人》一书中，成为敌意收购的经典案例。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of hostile takeovers originated in the United States in the mid-20th century. During the 1950s and 1960s, as capital markets developed and corporate ownership became more dispersed, hostile takeovers emerged as a common business strategy. A notable example is the 1988 acquisition of RJR Nabisco by KKR, which was documented in the book *Barbarians at the Gate*, becoming a classic case of hostile takeovers.

* **影响 / Impact**

  **English Impact**: Hostile takeovers have had a profound impact on global capital markets. They have driven improvements in corporate governance, encouraging management to prioritize shareholder interests.
