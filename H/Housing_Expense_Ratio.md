## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  住房支出比率的起源可以追溯到20世纪初的美国，当时随着城市化进程加快和房地产市场的兴起，金融机构开始关注借款人的还款能力。20世纪30年代的大萧条进一步推动了这一概念的发展，银行和监管机构开始使用这一比率来评估贷款风险。  
  The origin of the Housing Expense Ratio can be traced back to early 20th-century America when urbanization and the rise of the real estate market led financial institutions to focus on borrowers' repayment capacity.
