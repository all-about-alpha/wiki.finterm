  **English Explanation**: The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) is a government initiative launched in 2009 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It aims to assist homeowners at risk of mortgage default by modifying loan terms (e.g., reducing interest rates, extending loan terms, or reducing principal) to alleviate repayment burdens and prevent foreclosure.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：HAMP主要适用于因经济困难而无法按时偿还房贷的房主，特别是那些因失业、收入下降或其他财务危机而面临丧失抵押品赎回权风险的群体。申请者需满足特定条件，如贷款金额上限、房屋自住要求等。风险包括申请流程复杂、审批时间较长以及可能无法获得永久性贷款修改。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: HAMP is primarily designed for homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments due to financial hardships, such as job loss, reduced income, or other economic crises. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including loan amount limits and owner-occupancy requirements. Risks include complex application processes, lengthy approval times, and the possibility of not securing permanent loan modifications.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：HAMP起源于2008年全球金融危机期间，当时美国房地产市场崩溃导致大量房主面临止赎风险。2009年2月，奥巴马政府宣布了“住房可负担性和稳定性计划”（Making Home Affordable Program），其中HAMP作为核心组成部分正式启动。该计划旨在通过修改贷款条款帮助数百万家庭保住住房。  
  **English Origin**: HAMP originated during the global financial crisis of 2008 when the collapse of the U.S. housing market left many homeowners at risk of foreclosure. In February 2009, the Obama administration announced the Making Home Affordable Program, with HAMP as its central component. The program aimed to help millions of families retain their homes through loan modifications.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：HAMP在实施期间帮助了超过150万美国家庭成功修改了房贷条款，显著降低了止赎率并稳定了房地产市场。然而，该计划也因审批流程繁琐、覆盖范围有限等问题受到批评。目前，随着经济复苏和房地产市场回暖，HAMP已于2016年底正式结束。  
  **English Impact**: During its implementation, HAMP assisted over 1.5 million American families in modifying their mortgage terms, significantly reducing foreclosure rates and stabilizing the housing market.
