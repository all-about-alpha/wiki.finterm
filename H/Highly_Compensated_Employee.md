# Highly Compensated Employee

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 高薪员工（Highly Compensated Employee）是指在美国税法下，收入超过特定门槛的员工。根据《国内税收法典》（Internal Revenue Code），高薪员工通常指在上一纳税年度中收入超过一定金额（如$130,000，具体金额随通胀调整）的员工。这一分类主要用于退休计划（如401(k)）的测试，以确保高薪员工与非高薪员工之间的福利分配公平。  
  **English Explanation**: A Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) refers to an employee whose income exceeds a specific threshold under U.S. tax law. According to the Internal Revenue Code, an HCE is typically defined as an employee who earned more than a certain amount (e.g., $130,000, adjusted for inflation) in the previous tax year. This classification is primarily used in retirement plan testing (e.g., 401(k)) to ensure equitable benefit distribution between highly compensated and non-highly compensated employees.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: 高薪员工的分类主要应用于企业退休计划的合规性测试，如非歧视测试（Non-Discrimination Testing）。企业需确保其退休计划不会过度偏向高薪员工，否则可能面临税务处罚。此外，高薪员工的薪酬结构也可能影响企业的税务筹划和员工福利设计。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: The classification of Highly Compensated Employees is primarily applied in compliance testing for corporate retirement plans, such as Non-Discrimination Testing. Companies must ensure that their retirement plans do not disproportionately favor HCEs, or they may face tax penalties. Additionally, the compensation structure of HCEs can impact corporate tax planning and employee benefit design.
