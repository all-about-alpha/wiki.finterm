# House Poor

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “房奴”（House Poor）是指个人或家庭因购房而背负过重的房贷压力，导致其可支配收入的大部分用于偿还房贷，从而在其他生活开支或投资方面捉襟见肘的现象。这一概念最早由经济学家提出，用于描述因房产支出过高而影响整体财务健康的情况。核心概念包括高负债率、低流动性以及生活质量下降。  

  **English Explanation**  
  "House Poor" refers to individuals or families who are burdened with excessive mortgage payments due to homeownership, leaving a significant portion of their disposable income allocated to housing costs. This results in limited funds for other living expenses or investments. The term, coined by economists, highlights the financial strain caused by high housing expenses, with key concepts including high debt-to-income ratios, low liquidity, and reduced quality of life.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  在房价高企的城市（如北京、上海、深圳等），许多购房者为了拥有一套房产，不得不承担高额房贷，导致每月收入的大部分用于还贷，从而压缩了其他消费或储蓄的空间。这种现象在年轻家庭或首次购房者中尤为常见。风险提示：过度依赖房产投资可能导致财务脆弱性，一旦收入下降或利率上升，可能面临断供风险。  

  **English Application**  
  In cities with high housing prices (e.g., New York, London, Sydney), many homebuyers take on substantial mortgages to own property, dedicating a large portion of their monthly income to repayments. This leaves little room for other expenses or savings. The phenomenon is particularly common among young families or first-time homebuyers. Risk Note: Over-reliance on real estate investments can lead to financial vulnerability, with potential default risks if income decreases or interest rates rise.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，“房奴”现象反映了房地产市场过热和金融风险积聚的问题，可能引发系统性风险。从投资角度看，过度集中于房产投资会降低资产配置的多样性，增加财务风险。从行业角度看，高房价和房贷压力可能抑制消费需求，影响整体经济发展。  

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the "House Poor" phenomenon highlights issues of overheated real estate markets and accumulating financial risks, potentially leading to systemic risks. From an investment standpoint, over-concentration in real estate reduces portfolio diversification and increases financial vulnerability. From an industry perspective, high housing prices and mortgage burdens can suppress consumer demand, impacting overall economic growth.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  “房奴”一词最早出现在20世纪80年代的美国，当时房价快速上涨，许多家庭为了购房背负了高额房贷。2008年全球金融危机期间，这一现象进一步凸显，大量家庭因房价下跌和收入减少而陷入财务困境。在中国，“房奴”现象随着21世纪初房价的快速上涨而逐渐普及，尤其是在一线城市。  

  **English Origin**  
  The term "House Poor" originated in the United States in the 1980s, when rapidly rising housing prices led many families to take on heavy mortgage burdens. During the 2008 global financial crisis, this phenomenon became more pronounced, as falling home prices and reduced incomes left many households financially strained. In China, the concept gained prominence in the early 2000s with the rapid rise in housing prices, particularly in first-tier cities.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  “房奴”现象对房地产市场、金融系统和消费市场产生了深远影响。在房地产市场中，高房贷压力抑制了购房需求，导致市场波动。在金融系统中，房贷违约风险增加，可能引发银行系统危机。在消费市场中，家庭可支配收入减少，导致消费能力下降，影响经济增长。  

  **English Impact**  
  The "House Poor" phenomenon has had a profound impact on real estate markets, financial systems, and consumer markets. In real estate, high mortgage pressures suppress housing demand, leading to market volatility. In financial systems, increased mortgage default risks can trigger banking crises. In consumer markets, reduced disposable income lowers spending power, affecting economic growth.
