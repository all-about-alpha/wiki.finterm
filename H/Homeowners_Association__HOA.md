  **English Explanation**: A Homeowners Association (HOA) is a non-profit organization voluntarily formed by homeowners within a residential community to manage and maintain common areas, amenities, and community standards.

  **English Application Scenarios**: HOAs are commonly found in gated communities, condominiums, or townhouse developments. Homeowners must adhere to HOA rules, such as architectural standards or noise restrictions. Non-compliance may result in fines or penalties. Additionally, HOA fees can increase annually, adding financial pressure on homeowners.

  **中文历史背景**：业主协会的概念起源于20世纪初的美国，随着城市化进程加快和住宅区的集中开发而兴起。最早的HOA之一成立于1924年的洛杉矶郊区，旨在管理新兴社区的公共设施和环境。随着时间的推移，这一模式逐渐普及并成为现代住宅区管理的标准形式之一。  
  **English Historical Background**: The concept of HOAs originated in the early 20th century in the United States, emerging alongside urbanization and the development of concentrated residential areas. One of the earliest HOAs was established in 1924 in a Los Angeles suburb to manage public amenities and environments in new communities.
