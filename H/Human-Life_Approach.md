# Human-Life Approach

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：人类生命价值法（Human-Life Approach）是一种用于评估个人生命经济价值的方法，通常用于保险和财务规划领域。该方法通过计算个人未来收入潜力、家庭经济贡献以及潜在的经济损失来确定其生命价值。其核心概念是将人的生命视为一种经济资产，从而为其提供相应的财务保障。  
  **English Explanation**: The Human-Life Approach is a method used to assess the economic value of an individual's life, commonly applied in insurance and financial planning.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：人类生命价值法广泛应用于人寿保险的保额确定、家庭财务规划以及遗产规划中。例如，保险公司会根据个人的收入、职业、年龄等因素，使用该方法计算其应购买的保险金额。需要注意的是，该方法忽略了非经济因素（如情感价值），因此在应用时需结合其他评估方法以全面衡量个人价值。

For example, insurance companies use this method to calculate the appropriate amount of coverage based on factors such as income, occupation, and age.
