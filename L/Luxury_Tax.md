## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **中文起源**: 奢侈品税的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初的美国。1921年，美国首次引入奢侈品税以应对第一次世界大战后的财政压力。此后，许多国家陆续效仿这一做法，将其作为调节经济和增加财政收入的手段。中国在21世纪初开始逐步引入类似税收政策，以应对日益扩大的贫富差距和高端消费市场的快速发展。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of luxury taxes dates back to the early 20th century in the United States. In 1921, the U.S. first introduced luxury taxes to address post-World War I fiscal pressures.

China began gradually introducing similar tax policies in the early 21st century to address growing wealth inequality and the rapid development of its high-end consumer market.
