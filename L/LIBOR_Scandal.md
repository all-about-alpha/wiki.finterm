# LIBOR Scandal

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：LIBOR（伦敦银行间同业拆借利率）丑闻是指2012年曝光的全球多家大型银行操纵LIBOR利率的金融丑闻。LIBOR是全球金融市场的重要基准利率，用于确定各种金融产品的利率，如贷款、抵押和衍生品。多家银行被指控通过人为调整报价来谋取私利或掩盖财务困境。  
  **English Explanation**: The LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) Scandal refers to the financial scandal exposed in 2012, where several major global banks were found manipulating the LIBOR rate. LIBOR is a critical benchmark rate in global financial markets, used to determine interest rates for various financial products such as loans, mortgages, and derivatives. Banks were accused of artificially adjusting their submissions for personal gain or to conceal financial difficulties.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景与风险提示**：LIBOR广泛应用于全球金融市场，包括贷款、债券、衍生品等产品的定价。丑闻暴露后，市场对基准利率的信任度大幅下降，导致监管机构加强了对金融市场的监管，并推动了替代基准利率（如SOFR）的开发和应用。投资者需警惕类似操纵行为对投资组合的影响。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: LIBOR is widely used in global financial markets for pricing loans, bonds, derivatives, and other products. After the scandal, market trust in benchmark rates plummeted, prompting regulators to strengthen oversight and accelerate the development of alternative rates like SOFR. Investors should be wary of similar manipulations affecting their portfolios.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，LIBOR丑闻促使全球金融监管机构加强了对基准利率的监督和改革；从投资角度看，投资者需重新评估依赖LIBOR的金融产品的风险；从行业角度看，丑闻推动了金融市场向更透明、更可靠的基准利率体系转型。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the scandal led to enhanced oversight and reform of benchmark rates globally. For investors, it necessitated a reassessment of risks associated with LIBOR-linked products. For the industry, it accelerated the transition toward more transparent and reliable benchmark rate systems.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文历史背景**：LIBOR丑闻的起源可追溯至2008年金融危机期间。当时多家银行被指控通过操纵LIBOR来掩盖其财务困境或谋取交易利润。2012年，巴克莱银行成为首家承认操纵行为的银行，随后瑞银、德意志银行等多家机构也被卷入其中。调查揭示了长达数年的系统性操纵行为。  
  **English Historical Background**: The origins of the LIBOR Scandal trace back to the 2008 financial crisis when several banks were accused of manipulating LIBOR to conceal financial distress or profit from trades.
