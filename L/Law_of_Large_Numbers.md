# Law of Large Numbers

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **大数定律**是概率论中的一个基本定理，由瑞士数学家雅各布·伯努利（Jacob Bernoulli）在17世纪提出。其核心概念是：在独立重复试验中，随着试验次数的增加，事件发生的频率将趋近于其理论概率。  
  The **Law of Large Numbers** is a fundamental theorem in probability theory, proposed by Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli in the 17th century. It states that as the number of trials increases, the frequency of an event's occurrence will converge to its theoretical probability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在金融领域，大数定律被广泛应用于保险精算、投资组合管理和风险管理中。例如，保险公司通过大量保单的统计来预测赔付率，从而制定合理的保费。需要注意的是，大数定律依赖于独立性和重复性假设，若数据不满足这些条件，结论可能失效。  
  In finance, the Law of Large Numbers is widely applied in actuarial science, portfolio management, and risk management. For instance, insurance companies use statistical data from a large number of policies to predict claim rates and set premiums. It is important to note that the Law relies on assumptions of independence and repetition; if these conditions are not met, the conclusions may be invalid.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，大数定律为金融市场的稳定性和可预测性提供了理论基础；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者理解长期收益的稳定性；从行业角度看，它是保险、银行等金融机构进行风险定价和管理的核心工具。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Law provides a theoretical basis for market stability and predictability; from an investment perspective, it helps investors understand the stability of long-term returns; from an industry perspective, it is a core tool for risk pricing and management in sectors like insurance and banking.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  大数定律最早由雅各布·伯努利在其著作《猜度术》（Ars Conjectandi）中提出。他通过研究抛硬币实验发现，随着试验次数的增加，正面和反面的出现频率会趋近于50%。这一发现为现代概率论奠定了基础。  
  The Law of Large Numbers was first proposed by Jacob Bernoulli in his work *Ars Conjectandi*. Through coin-tossing experiments, he observed that as the number of trials increased, the frequency of heads and tails approached 50%. This discovery laid the foundation for modern probability theory.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  大数定律对金融行业产生了深远影响。例如，在保险业中，它帮助公司通过大量数据预测风险并制定合理的保费策略；在投资领域，它为长期投资的稳定性提供了理论支持。如今，这一理论已成为金融工程和风险管理的基础工具之一。  
  The Law has had a profound impact on the financial industry. For example, in insurance, it helps companies predict risks and set premiums based on large datasets; in investment, it provides theoretical support for the stability of long-term investments. Today, it is one of the foundational tools in financial engineering and risk management.
