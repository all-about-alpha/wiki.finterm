From an investment and industry standpoint, liability insurance helps businesses mitigate risks, enhance market competitiveness, and provide timely compensation to victims.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  责任保险的起源可追溯到19世纪的英国工业革命时期。随着工业化进程加速，工厂事故频发，雇主开始寻求保护自身免受工人索赔的方式。1880年，英国首次推出雇主责任保险（Employers' Liability Insurance），标志着现代责任保险的诞生。在中国，20世纪80年代改革开放后，随着市场经济的发展和法律体系的完善，责任保险逐渐被引入并推广。  
  The origin of liability insurance dates back to the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Britain. As industrialization accelerated, factory accidents became frequent, prompting employers to seek protection against workers' claims. In 1880, the UK introduced Employers' Liability Insurance for the first time, marking the birth of modern liability insurance. In China, after the reform and opening-up in the 1980s, with the development of a market economy and improvement of the legal system, liability insurance was gradually introduced and promoted.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在全球范围内，责任保险已成为风险管理的重要工具之一。它不仅保护了企业和个人的利益，还促进了社会公平与稳定。在中国，随着消费者权益保护意识的增强和法律环境的完善，产品责任险和医疗事故险等细分市场迅速发展。目前，中国已成为全球第二大保险市场，其中责任保险占据重要份额。  
  Globally, liability insurance has become a crucial tool for risk management. It not only protects the interests of businesses and individuals but also promotes social fairness and stability. In China, with increasing consumer rights awareness and improvements in the legal environment, niche markets such as product liability insurance and medical malpractice insurance have grown rapidly. Currently, China is the world's second-largest insurance market, with liability insurance playing a significant role.
