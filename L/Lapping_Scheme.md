# Lapping Scheme

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Lapping Scheme（挪用循环）是一种财务欺诈手段，通常由公司内部人员（如会计或出纳）实施。其核心概念是通过挪用客户支付的款项来掩盖之前的挪用行为，形成一种“拆东墙补西墙”的循环。具体操作方式是，将新收到的客户付款用于填补之前挪用的资金缺口，而不是将其正确入账。  
  **English Explanation**: A Lapping Scheme is a type of financial fraud typically perpetrated by internal personnel (such as accountants or cashiers) within a company. The core concept involves misappropriating customer payments to cover up previous misappropriations, creating a cycle of "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Specifically, newly received customer payments are used to fill gaps created by prior misappropriations rather than being properly recorded.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：Lapping Scheme常见于现金流管理不善的企业，尤其是那些依赖客户预付款或分期付款的公司。例如，在零售、服务行业或应收账款管理中，员工可能利用客户付款的时间差进行挪用。这种欺诈行为通常伴随着虚假账目或延迟入账，以掩盖资金缺口。风险在于，一旦资金链断裂，欺诈行为将暴露，导致公司财务危机甚至法律诉讼。  
  **English Explanation**: Lapping Schemes are often found in companies with poor cash flow management, particularly those reliant on customer prepayments or installment payments. For example, in retail, service industries, or accounts receivable management, employees may exploit timing differences in customer payments to misappropriate funds. This fraud is typically accompanied by false accounting entries or delayed postings to conceal financial gaps. The risk is that once the cash flow chain breaks, the fraud will be exposed, leading to financial crises or even legal action.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度来看，Lapping Scheme是财务审计和内部控制的重要关注点，因其隐蔽性强且可能对企业的财务健康造成严重损害。对于投资者而言，发现此类欺诈行为可能意味着公司治理存在重大缺陷，从而影响投资决策。从行业角度来看，此类欺诈行为的频发可能引发更严格的监管措施和审计要求。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Lapping Schemes are a critical focus in financial audits and internal controls due to their high concealability and potential to severely damage a company's financial health. For investors, the discovery of such fraud may indicate significant governance flaws, impacting investment decisions. From an industry perspective, frequent occurrences of such fraud may lead to stricter regulatory measures and audit requirements.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：Lapping Scheme的起源可以追溯到20世纪初，当时企业财务管理尚未规范化，内部控制机制薄弱。最早的案例多发生在小型企业或家族企业中，由于缺乏有效的监督，员工容易利用职权进行资金挪用。随着现代审计技术的发展，此类欺诈行为逐渐被揭露并引起广泛关注。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of Lapping Schemes dates back to the early 20th century when corporate financial management was not yet standardized, and internal control mechanisms were weak. The earliest cases often occurred in small businesses or family-owned enterprises, where employees could easily exploit their authority to misappropriate funds due to a lack of effective oversight. With the development of modern auditing techniques, such fraudulent activities have gradually been exposed and garnered widespread attention.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：Lapping Scheme的曝光通常会导致企业声誉受损、财务损失以及法律后果。在某些案例中，企业甚至因此破产。此外，此类欺诈行为的频发促使监管机构加强了对企业内部控制的审查，推动了财务透明度和审计标准的提升。  
  **English Explanation**: The exposure of Lapping Schemes typically results in reputational damage, financial losses, and legal consequences for companies. In some cases, businesses have even gone bankrupt as a result. Additionally, the frequent occurrence of such fraud has prompted regulatory bodies to strengthen scrutiny of internal controls, driving improvements in financial transparency and auditing standards.
