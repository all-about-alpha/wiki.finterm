## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 生前信托（Living Trust）是一种由个人（称为委托人）在其生前设立的信托，旨在管理和分配其资产。委托人将资产转移至信托名下，并指定受托人（可以是自己或他人）在委托人生前或死后按照信托条款管理这些资产。生前信托的核心概念在于避免遗产认证程序，确保资产的私密性和高效转移。  
  **English Explanation**: A Living Trust is a trust established by an individual (known as the grantor) during their lifetime to manage and distribute their assets.

The core concept of a Living Trust is to bypass probate, ensuring privacy and efficient asset transfer.
