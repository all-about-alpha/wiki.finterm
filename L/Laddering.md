# Laddering

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Laddering（阶梯策略）是一种投资策略，通常用于固定收益投资（如债券或定期存款）中。其核心概念是将投资资金分散到不同到期日的证券中，以降低利率波动带来的风险，并确保在不同时间点有资金回流。这种策略最早由机构投资者提出，后来被个人投资者广泛采用。  
  **English Explanation**: Laddering is an investment strategy commonly used in fixed-income investments (such as bonds or term deposits). The core concept involves distributing investment funds across securities with different maturity dates to mitigate risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and ensure a steady cash flow at various points in time. This strategy was initially proposed by institutional investors and later widely adopted by individual investors.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：阶梯策略常用于债券投资组合管理。例如，投资者可以将资金分配到1年、3年、5年、7年和10年到期的债券中。当短期债券到期后，投资者可以将回流的资金再投资于更长期的债券，从而保持投资组合的流动性并捕捉更高的利率。需要注意的是，阶梯策略虽然能降低利率风险，但无法完全消除市场波动带来的影响。  
  **English Application**: Laddering is often used in bond portfolio management. For example, an investor might allocate funds to bonds maturing in 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. When the short-term bonds mature, the investor can reinvest the proceeds into longer-term bonds, maintaining portfolio liquidity and capturing higher interest rates. It is important to note that while laddering reduces interest rate risk, it cannot completely eliminate the impact of market volatility.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，阶梯策略有助于投资者分散风险，符合稳健投资的原则。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了稳定的现金流和更高的灵活性。从行业角度看，阶梯策略的普及推动了固定收益市场的多样化发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, laddering helps investors diversify risks and aligns with the principles of prudent investing. From an investment standpoint, it provides stable cash flow and greater flexibility. From an industry perspective, the popularity of laddering has driven the diversification of the fixed-income market.

  **中文起源**：阶梯策略的起源可以追溯到20世纪中期，当时机构投资者为了应对利率波动，开始尝试将资金分散到不同期限的债券中。20世纪80年代，随着利率市场化改革的推进，个人投资者也开始采用这一策略。阶梯策略的发现并非由单一人物提出，而是市场实践中的集体智慧结晶。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of laddering can be traced back to the mid-20th century when institutional investors began experimenting with distributing funds across bonds of different maturities to cope with interest rate fluctuations. In the 1980s, with the advancement of interest rate liberalization reforms, individual investors also began adopting this strategy.
