## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：杠杆自由现金流（Levered Free Cash Flow, LFCF）是指企业在支付了所有运营费用、资本支出以及债务利息和本金后的剩余现金流。它反映了企业在考虑财务杠杆（即债务）后的实际可支配现金流，通常用于评估企业的偿债能力和股东回报能力。  
  - **English Explanation**: Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF) refers to the cash flow remaining after a company has paid all operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt-related obligations such as interest and principal repayments. It represents the actual disposable cash flow available to the company after accounting for financial leverage (i.e., debt) and is commonly used to assess a company's ability to service debt and return value to shareholders.

  - **中文应用场景**：LFCF主要用于评估企业的财务健康状况，尤其是在高负债企业中。投资者和分析师通过LFCF来判断企业是否有足够的现金流来偿还债务、支付股息或进行再投资。需要注意的是，LFCF受企业资本结构影响较大，高杠杆企业可能面临较大的偿债压力。  
  - **English Application**: LFCF is primarily used to evaluate a company's financial health, especially in highly leveraged firms. Investors and analysts use LFCF to determine whether a company has sufficient cash flow to repay debt, pay dividends, or reinvest. It is important to note that LFCF is heavily influenced by a company's capital structure, and highly leveraged companies may face significant debt repayment pressures.
