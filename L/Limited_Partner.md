# Limited Partner

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：有限合伙人（Limited Partner，简称LP）是指在有限合伙企业中，以出资额为限承担有限责任的合伙人。LP不参与企业的日常经营管理，其责任仅限于其出资额，不承担无限连带责任。有限合伙制起源于英美法系，是现代私募股权基金和风险投资基金的常见组织形式。  
  **English Explanation**: A Limited Partner (LP) is an investor in a limited partnership who contributes capital and assumes liability only up to the amount of their investment. LPs do not participate in the day-to-day management of the partnership and are not personally liable for the partnership’s debts beyond their invested capital. The concept originates from Anglo-American legal systems and is commonly used in private equity and venture capital funds.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：有限合伙人主要应用于私募股权基金、风险投资基金和房地产投资基金等领域。LP通过出资获得收益分配权，但不参与具体运营决策。需要注意的是，LP需谨慎选择普通合伙人（GP），因为GP负责管理资金并承担无限责任。  
  **English Application**: Limited Partners are primarily involved in private equity, venture capital, and real estate investment funds. LPs earn returns on their investments but do not engage in operational decisions. It is crucial for LPs to carefully select General Partners (GPs), as GPs manage the funds and assume unlimited liability.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，有限合伙制有助于明确责任边界，保护投资者权益；从投资角度看，LP为资本市场提供了稳定的资金来源；从行业角度看，这种模式推动了私募股权和风险投资行业的快速发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, limited partnerships clarify liability boundaries and protect investor rights. From an investment standpoint, LPs provide a stable source of capital for financial markets. From an industry perspective, this model has driven the rapid growth of private equity and venture capital sectors.
