# London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **伦敦银行间拆入利率 (LIBID)** 是伦敦银行间市场上，银行愿意为吸收其他银行的存款而支付的利率。它是银行间借贷市场的重要参考利率之一，反映了银行在短期资金市场上的融资成本。  
  **The London Interbank Bid Rate (LIBID)** is the interest rate at which banks are willing to borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market. It serves as a key benchmark rate for short-term funding costs in the interbank lending market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文场景中，LIBID常用于衡量银行间市场的资金成本，特别是在短期融资和流动性管理中。它也被用于衍生品定价和风险评估中。需要注意的是，LIBID与LIBOR（伦敦银行间同业拆借利率）不同，前者是“买入”利率，后者是“卖出”利率。  
  In English contexts, LIBID is used to gauge funding costs in the interbank market, particularly for short-term financing and liquidity management. It is also applied in derivatives pricing and risk assessment. It’s important to note that LIBID differs from LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), as the former represents the "bid" rate while the latter represents the "offer" rate.
