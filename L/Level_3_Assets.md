# Level 3 Assets

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：三级资产（Level 3 Assets）是指那些在市场上没有活跃交易、难以估值的金融资产。这类资产的估值通常依赖于公司内部的模型和假设，而非市场数据。根据美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）的《财务会计准则第157号》（FAS 157），资产被分为三个等级，其中三级资产的估值不确定性最高。  
  **English Explanation**: Level 3 Assets refer to financial assets that are not actively traded in the market and are difficult to value. The valuation of these assets typically relies on internal models and assumptions rather than market data. According to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 157 (FAS 157), assets are categorized into three levels, with Level 3 Assets having the highest degree of valuation uncertainty.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：三级资产常见于金融机构的资产负债表，尤其是那些持有复杂金融工具（如衍生品、私募股权或非流动性证券）的公司。由于缺乏市场报价，这些资产的估值可能受到主观判断的影响，从而增加财务报告的波动性和风险。投资者和监管机构需特别关注此类资产的披露和透明度。  
  **English Application**: Level 3 Assets are commonly found on the balance sheets of financial institutions, particularly those holding complex financial instruments such as derivatives, private equity, or illiquid securities. Due to the lack of market quotes, the valuation of these assets may be influenced by subjective judgments, increasing the volatility and risk in financial reporting. Investors and regulators need to pay special attention to the disclosure and transparency of such assets.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，三级资产的透明度和准确性对维护金融市场稳定至关重要。从投资角度看，这类资产的高不确定性可能影响公司的财务健康状况和股价表现。从行业角度看，合理管理三级资产有助于降低系统性风险并提升投资者信心。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the transparency and accuracy of Level 3 Assets are crucial for maintaining financial market stability. From an investment perspective, the high uncertainty associated with these assets can impact a company's financial health and stock performance. From an industry perspective, proper management of Level 3 Assets helps reduce systemic risks and enhance investor confidence.
