# Lehman Formula

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Lehman Formula（雷曼公式）是一种用于计算投资银行在并购（M&A）交易中收取的财务顾问费用的标准方法。该公式由雷曼兄弟公司（Lehman Brothers）在20世纪60年代首创，其核心概念是根据交易金额的特定比例分段计算费用。通常，公式采用“5-4-3-2-1”结构，即前100万美元收取5%，接下来的200万美元收取4%，以此类推。  
  **English Explanation**: The Lehman Formula is a standard method used to calculate the financial advisory fees charged by investment banks in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions. It was pioneered by Lehman Brothers in the 1960s, with its core concept being the calculation of fees based on specific percentages of the transaction amount in tiers. Typically, the formula follows a "5-4-3-2-1" structure, where the first $1 million is charged at 5%, the next $2 million at 4%, and so on.
