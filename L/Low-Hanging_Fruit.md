* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从投资和行业角度来看，低垂的果实能够帮助企业快速提升业绩、增强信心并为更复杂的项目积累资源。然而，监管机构也提醒企业需平衡短期收益与长期发展，避免因追求“易得”而错失更大的机会。  
  **English Significance**: From an investment and industry perspective, low-hanging fruit can help companies quickly improve performance, build confidence, and accumulate resources for more complex projects.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：低垂的果实这一比喻最早可追溯到农业社会，农民在采摘果实时会优先选择那些位置较低、易于摘取的果实。这一概念后来被引入商业领域，成为描述“易得机会”的常用术语。20世纪80年代后，随着管理学和战略规划的普及，“低垂的果实”逐渐成为企业决策中的关键概念之一。  
  **English Origin**: The metaphor of low-hanging fruit dates back to agricultural societies, where farmers would prioritize picking fruits that were low on the tree and easy to reach. This concept was later introduced into the business world as a common term for describing "easy opportunities." Since the 1980s, with the popularization of management science and strategic planning, "low-hanging fruit" has become a key concept in corporate decision-making.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：在企业管理中，“低垂的果实”策略被广泛应用于提高效率和降低成本。然而，随着市场竞争加剧和资源有限性凸显，企业逐渐意识到仅依赖“易得机会”难以实现可持续发展。因此，“低垂的果实”更多被视为短期策略而非长期解决方案。  
  **English Impact**: In corporate management, the "low-hanging fruit" strategy has been widely used to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, as market competition intensifies and resource limitations become more apparent, companies have realized that relying solely on "easy opportunities" is insufficient for sustainable development. Therefore, "low-hanging fruit" is increasingly seen as a short-term strategy rather than a long-term solution.
