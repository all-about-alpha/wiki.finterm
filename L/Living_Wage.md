# Living Wage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  生活工资（Living Wage）是指劳动者在特定地区工作，能够维持基本生活水平所需的最低收入标准。这一概念最早由社会活动家和劳工组织提出，旨在确保劳动者不仅能满足基本生存需求，还能参与社会活动并享有一定的生活质量。生活工资通常高于法定最低工资，考虑了住房、食品、医疗、交通等基本生活成本。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A Living Wage refers to the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet basic living standards in a specific region. This concept was initially proposed by social activists and labor organizations to ensure that workers not only meet their basic survival needs but also participate in social activities and enjoy a certain quality of life. The Living Wage is typically higher than the statutory minimum wage and takes into account basic living costs such as housing, food, healthcare, and transportation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  生活工资的概念广泛应用于企业社会责任（CSR）项目、政府政策制定以及非营利组织的倡议中。例如，一些跨国公司承诺向其全球供应链中的工人支付生活工资，以改善劳工条件。在中国，生活工资的讨论多集中在经济发达的一线城市，如北京、上海，这些地区的生活成本较高，法定最低工资往往难以满足劳动者的实际需求。需要注意的是，生活工资的实施可能增加企业成本，尤其是在劳动密集型行业。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  The concept of a Living Wage is widely applied in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, government policy-making, and non-profit advocacy. For example, some multinational corporations commit to paying a Living Wage to workers in their global supply chains to improve labor conditions. In China, discussions on the Living Wage are often focused on economically developed cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where the high cost of living makes the statutory minimum wage insufficient for workers' actual needs. It is important to note that implementing a Living Wage may increase business costs, particularly in labor-intensive industries.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，生活工资的推广有助于缩小贫富差距，促进社会公平。从投资角度看，支付生活工资的企业往往被视为更具社会责任感和可持续发展潜力，可能吸引更多长期投资者。从行业角度看，生活工资的实施有助于提高员工满意度和生产力，减少员工流动率。然而，生活工资的普及也面临挑战，如企业成本上升和区域经济差异。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, promoting a Living Wage helps reduce income inequality and promote social equity. From an investment perspective, companies that pay a Living Wage are often seen as more socially responsible and sustainable, potentially attracting long-term investors. From an industry perspective, implementing a Living Wage can improve employee satisfaction and productivity while reducing turnover rates. However, the widespread adoption of a Living Wage faces challenges such as increased business costs and regional economic disparities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  生活工资的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末的英国，当时社会改革者如查尔斯·布斯（Charles Booth）和西德尼·韦伯（Sidney Webb）提出了“最低生活标准”的理念。20世纪初，美国劳工运动进一步推动了这一概念的发展。1990年代，随着全球化加速，生活工资运动在全球范围内兴起，特别是在发展中国家，劳工组织和非政府组织（NGO）开始倡导跨国公司支付生活工资。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of a Living Wage can be traced back to late 19th-century Britain, where social reformers like Charles Booth and Sidney Webb introduced the idea of a "minimum standard of living." In the early 20th century, the labor movement in the United States further developed this concept. By the 1990s, with the acceleration of globalization, the Living Wage movement gained momentum worldwide, particularly in developing countries, where labor organizations and NGOs began advocating for multinational corporations to pay a Living Wage.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  生活工资的推广对全球劳工权益保护产生了深远影响。在发达国家，许多城市通过了生活工资法案，要求政府承包商支付生活工资。在发展中国家，生活工资运动促使跨国公司改善供应链中的劳工条件。然而，生活工资的实施也引发争议，批评者认为其可能导致企业裁员或自动化加速。目前，生活工资已成为全球可持续发展目标（SDGs）的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**：  
  The promotion of a Living Wage has had a profound impact on global labor rights protection. In developed countries, many cities have passed Living Wage ordinances requiring government contractors to pay a Living Wage. In developing countries, the Living Wage movement has pressured multinational corporations to improve labor conditions in their supply chains. However, the implementation of a Living Wage has also sparked debates, with critics arguing that it may lead to job cuts or accelerated automation. Currently, the Living Wage is an integral part of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
