# Lock-Up Agreement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：锁定期协议（Lock-Up Agreement）是一种在资本市场中常见的合同条款，通常在公司首次公开募股（IPO）或重大并购交易中使用。该协议规定，公司内部人员（如创始人、高管、早期投资者等）在一定期限内不得出售或转让其持有的公司股份。这一期限通常为90天至180天，目的是防止大量股票在短期内涌入市场，导致股价剧烈波动。  
  **English Explanation**: A Lock-Up Agreement is a contractual clause commonly used in capital markets, typically during an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or significant merger and acquisition transactions. This agreement stipulates that insiders (such as founders, executives, and early investors) cannot sell or transfer their shares of the company for a specified period, usually ranging from 90 to 180 days. The purpose is to prevent a large influx of shares into the market in the short term, which could cause significant price volatility.

  **English Application**: Lock-Up Agreements are primarily used during IPOs to ensure market stability and protect the interests of public investors. They may also be employed in private equity financing, mergers, and acquisitions. It is important to note that violating a Lock-Up Agreement can lead to legal action or reputational damage.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：锁定期协议的起源可以追溯到20世纪80年代的美国资本市场。随着IPO市场的快速发展，监管机构发现内部人员在上市后立即抛售股票的行为严重影响了市场稳定。因此，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）开始推动实施锁定期协议，以规范市场行为。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of Lock-Up Agreements can be traced back to the U.S. capital markets in the 1980s. With the rapid growth of the IPO market, regulators observed that insiders selling shares immediately after listing severely impacted market stability. Consequently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began promoting the implementation of Lock-Up Agreements to regulate market behavior.
