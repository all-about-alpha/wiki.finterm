# Lean Six Sigma

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：精益六西格玛（Lean Six Sigma）是一种结合了精益生产（Lean）和六西格玛（Six Sigma）的管理方法论，旨在通过消除浪费和减少变异来提高效率和质量。精益生产起源于丰田生产方式，强调减少非增值活动；六西格玛由摩托罗拉公司提出，专注于通过数据驱动的方法减少缺陷。  
  **English Explanation**: Lean Six Sigma is a management methodology that combines Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma, aiming to improve efficiency and quality by eliminating waste and reducing variation. Lean Manufacturing, originating from the Toyota Production System, focuses on reducing non-value-added activities; Six Sigma, introduced by Motorola, emphasizes defect reduction through data-driven methods.

  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，精益六西格玛具有重要意义。它帮助企业满足严格的行业标准，提升竞争力；投资者青睐采用该方法的企业，因其通常具有更高的运营效率和盈利能力；行业内部则通过推广精益六西格玛实现整体质量提升和创新驱动发展。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, Lean Six Sigma holds significant importance. It helps companies meet stringent industry standards and enhance competitiveness; investors favor companies adopting this methodology due to their higher operational efficiency and profitability; within industries, promoting Lean Six Sigma drives overall quality improvement and innovation-led development.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：精益生产的理念起源于20世纪40年代的丰田生产方式（Toyota Production System），由大野耐一等人开发，旨在通过消除浪费提高生产效率。六西格玛则由摩托罗拉工程师比尔·史密斯于1986年提出，旨在通过统计方法减少产品缺陷。两者在20世纪90年代被结合形成精益六西格玛。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of Lean Manufacturing originated in the 1940s with the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed by Taiichi Ohno and others to improve production efficiency by eliminating waste. Six Sigma was introduced in 1986 by Motorola engineer Bill Smith to reduce product defects through statistical methods. The two methodologies were combined in the 1990s to form Lean Six Sigma.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：精益六西格玛对全球制造业和服务业产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了企业的运营效率和质量水平，还推动了管理理念的革新。目前，许多跨国公司和中小企业都在采用这一方法论以实现持续改进和创新驱动发展。  
  **English Explanation**: Lean Six Sigma has had a profound impact on global manufacturing and service industries. It has not only improved operational efficiency and quality levels but also driven innovation in management practices. Today, many multinational corporations as well as small and medium-sized enterprises adopt this methodology for continuous improvement and innovation-driven development.
