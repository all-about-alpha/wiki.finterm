# Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：低收入住房税收抵免（Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, LIHTC）是美国联邦政府为鼓励私人开发商投资建设低收入住房而设立的一项税收优惠政策。该政策由1986年《税收改革法案》引入，核心概念是通过提供税收抵免，降低开发商的建设成本，从而增加低收入家庭的可负担住房供应。  
  **English Explanation**: The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a federal tax incentive program in the United States designed to encourage private developers to invest in the construction of affordable housing for low-income households. Established under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the program provides tax credits to developers, reducing their construction costs and thereby increasing the supply of affordable housing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：LIHTC主要应用于低收入住房项目的开发与运营。开发商通过申请税收抵免，获得项目资金支持，但需承诺在一定期限内（通常为15-30年）将住房租金控制在低收入家庭可负担的范围内。风险包括项目运营不善导致的税收抵免失效，以及政策变动可能带来的不确定性。  
  **English Explanation**: LIHTC is primarily used in the development and operation of low-income housing projects. Developers apply for tax credits to secure funding, but they must commit to maintaining affordable rent levels for low-income households for a specified period (typically 15-30 years). Risks include the potential loss of tax credits due to poor project management and uncertainties arising from policy changes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，LIHTC是美国政府解决低收入家庭住房问题的重要工具；从投资角度看，它为开发商提供了稳定的资金支持；从行业角度看，它推动了可负担住房市场的可持续发展。

From an investment standpoint, it provides developers with stable financial support. From an industry perspective, it promotes the sustainable development of the affordable housing market.
