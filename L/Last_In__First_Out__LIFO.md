# Last In, First Out (LIFO)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：后进先出法（LIFO）是一种库存管理方法，假设最后进入库存的商品最先被售出或使用。这种方法常用于会计和税务领域，特别是在计算库存成本和利润时。其核心概念是，最新购入的商品成本被优先计入销售成本，从而影响企业的财务报表和税务负担。  
  **English Explanation**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) is an inventory management method that assumes the last items added to inventory are the first ones sold or used. This method is commonly used in accounting and taxation, particularly for calculating inventory costs and profits. The core concept is that the cost of the most recently purchased items is recorded first in the cost of goods sold, thereby impacting financial statements and tax liabilities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：LIFO法常用于通货膨胀环境下，因为最新购入的商品成本较高，使用LIFO法可以降低企业的应税利润，从而减少税负。然而，这种方法可能导致财务报表中的库存价值被低估，影响企业的财务健康状况评估。  
  **English Application**: LIFO is often used in inflationary environments because the cost of the most recently purchased items is higher. Using LIFO can reduce a company's taxable income, thereby lowering tax liabilities. However, this method may result in undervaluation of inventory on financial statements, affecting the assessment of a company's financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，LIFO法在某些国家（如美国）被允许用于税务目的，但在国际财务报告准则（IFRS）下不被允许。从投资角度看，使用LIFO法的企业可能在通胀期间表现出较低的利润，影响投资者的决策。从行业角度看，LIFO法在制造业和零售业中较为常见，因为这些行业的库存周转较快。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, LIFO is permitted for tax purposes in some countries (e.g., the U.S.) but not under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). From an investment perspective, companies using LIFO may show lower profits during inflationary periods, affecting investor decisions. From an industry perspective, LIFO is common in manufacturing and retail sectors due to their high inventory turnover rates.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：LIFO法的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪初的美国，当时企业开始寻找在通胀环境下减少税负的方法。1939年，美国国税局（IRS）正式允许企业使用LIFO法进行税务申报。这一方法的推广与20世纪中期的通胀环境密切相关。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of LIFO dates back to the early 20th century in the United States, when businesses began seeking ways to reduce tax liabilities during inflationary periods. In 1939, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officially allowed companies to use LIFO for tax reporting. The method gained popularity during the mid-20th century due to inflationary conditions.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：LIFO法在美国的广泛应用对企业的财务报表和税务策略产生了深远影响。然而，随着国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的推广，许多国家已禁止使用LIFO法，导致其全球应用范围逐渐缩小。尽管如此，LIFO法在美国仍是一种重要的税务工具。  
  **English Impact**: The widespread use of LIFO in the U.S. has significantly impacted corporate financial statements and tax strategies. However, with the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), many countries have banned LIFO, reducing its global applicability. Despite this, LIFO remains an important tax tool in the U.S.
