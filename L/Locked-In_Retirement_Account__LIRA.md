# Locked-In Retirement Account (LIRA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 锁定退休账户（LIRA）是一种加拿大特有的退休储蓄账户，用于存放从雇主赞助的养老金计划中转移的资金。这些资金在账户持有人达到法定退休年龄之前被“锁定”，无法随意提取，以确保其用于退休后的生活保障。LIRA的核心概念是强制储蓄和长期投资，旨在为个人提供稳定的退休收入来源。  
  **English Explanation**: A Locked-In Retirement Account (LIRA) is a Canadian-specific retirement savings account designed to hold funds transferred from employer-sponsored pension plans. These funds are "locked in" and cannot be withdrawn until the account holder reaches the legal retirement age, ensuring they are used for post-retirement financial security. The core concept of a LIRA is enforced savings and long-term investment, aiming to provide individuals with a stable source of retirement income.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: LIRA主要适用于那些从雇主养老金计划中离职或退休的个人。资金在账户中被锁定，只能用于特定的投资工具，如股票、债券或共同基金。提取资金通常受到严格限制，除非符合特定条件（如经济困难或达到法定年龄）。风险在于市场波动可能影响账户价值，且流动性较低。  
  **English Explanation**: LIRAs are primarily used by individuals who leave or retire from employer-sponsored pension plans. Funds in the account are locked in and can only be invested in specific instruments such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Withdrawals are typically restricted unless certain conditions are met (e.g., financial hardship or reaching the legal retirement age). Risks include market volatility affecting account value and low liquidity.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: LIRA在加拿大退休储蓄体系中扮演重要角色，确保养老金资金不被提前消耗，从而保障个人退休后的生活质量。从监管角度看，LIRA受省级法律约束，确保资金安全；从投资角度看，它鼓励长期投资和资产增值；从行业角度看，它为养老金管理提供了灵活性和透明度。  
  **English Explanation**: LIRAs play a crucial role in Canada’s retirement savings system by ensuring pension funds are not prematurely depleted, thereby safeguarding individuals' post-retirement quality of life. From a regulatory perspective, LIRAs are governed by provincial laws to ensure fund security; from an investment perspective, they encourage long-term investment and asset growth; from an industry perspective, they provide flexibility and transparency in pension management.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**: LIRA的起源可追溯到20世纪80年代加拿大养老金制度的改革。当时政府意识到需要一种机制来保护离职员工的养老金权益，防止他们提前支取并耗尽这些资金。1987年，《养老金福利标准法》的引入为LIRA的设立提供了法律框架。此后，各省相继制定了相关法规以规范LIRA的管理和使用。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of LIRAs dates back to the reforms of Canada’s pension system in the 1980s. At that time, the government recognized the need for a mechanism to protect the pension rights of employees who left their jobs, preventing them from prematurely withdrawing and depleting these funds. The introduction of the Pension Benefits Standards Act in 1987 provided the legal framework for establishing LIRAs. Subsequently, provinces enacted regulations to govern their management and use.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**: LIRA的设立对加拿大养老金行业产生了深远影响。它不仅增强了个人对养老金的控制权，还促进了长期投资市场的稳定发展。目前，LIRA已成为加拿大退休储蓄体系的重要组成部分，广泛应用于各类企业和个人的养老金管理中。其全球影响力主要体现在为其他国家提供了类似的锁定式退休账户模式的参考。  
  **English Explanation**: The establishment of LIRAs has had a profound impact on Canada’s pension industry. It not only enhanced individuals' control over their pensions but also promoted stability in long-term investment markets. Today, LIRAs have become an integral part of Canada’s retirement savings system and are widely used in various corporate and individual pension management practices.
