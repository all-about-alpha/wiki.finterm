# Liquidity Trap

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **流动性陷阱** 是由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）提出的概念，指在极低利率环境下，货币政策失效，人们宁愿持有现金而不愿投资或消费，导致经济陷入停滞的状态。核心概念包括利率接近零、货币需求无限弹性以及货币政策无法刺激经济。  
  **Liquidity Trap** is a concept introduced by economist John Maynard Keynes, referring to a situation where monetary policy becomes ineffective in stimulating the economy due to extremely low interest rates, leading individuals and businesses to prefer holding cash rather than investing or spending. Key concepts include near-zero interest rates, infinite elasticity of money demand, and the ineffectiveness of monetary policy.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文语境中，流动性陷阱常被用于分析经济衰退或通缩时期，尤其是在央行降息至接近零但仍无法提振经济的情况下。风险在于过度依赖货币政策可能导致政策工具枯竭，进一步加剧经济困境。  
  In English contexts, the liquidity trap is often used to analyze economic recessions or deflationary periods, especially when central banks lower interest rates to near zero but fail to stimulate the economy. The risk lies in over-reliance on monetary policy, which may exhaust policy tools and worsen economic conditions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，流动性陷阱提醒政策制定者需谨慎使用货币政策，同时探索财政政策等其他手段来应对经济危机。对于投资者而言，理解这一概念有助于规避低利率环境下的投资风险。  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the liquidity trap highlights the need for policymakers to use monetary policy cautiously while exploring other measures like fiscal policy to address economic crises. For investors, understanding this concept helps mitigate risks in low-interest-rate environments.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  流动性陷阱的概念最早由凯恩斯在其1936年出版的《就业、利息和货币通论》中提出。当时正值大萧条时期，凯恩斯观察到即使利率极低，企业和个人仍不愿借贷或投资，导致经济复苏乏力。这一理论为后来的宏观经济政策提供了重要参考。  
  The concept of the liquidity trap was first introduced by Keynes in his 1936 book *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money*. During the Great Depression, Keynes observed that even with extremely low interest rates, businesses and individuals were reluctant to borrow or invest, leading to sluggish economic recovery. This theory has since provided a critical reference for macroeconomic policies.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国和其他国家，流动性陷阱的概念被广泛应用于分析2008年全球金融危机后的经济政策效果。例如，日本在20世纪90年代的经济停滞也被视为典型的流动性陷阱案例。当前，许多国家在应对新冠疫情后的经济复苏时也面临类似挑战。  
  In China and globally, the concept of the liquidity trap has been widely applied to analyze the effectiveness of economic policies following the 2008 financial crisis. For instance, Japan's economic stagnation in the 1990s is often cited as a classic example. Currently, many countries face similar challenges in post-COVID-19 economic recovery.
