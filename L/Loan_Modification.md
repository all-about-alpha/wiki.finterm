# Loan Modification

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：贷款修改（Loan Modification）是指借款人与贷款机构协商，对现有贷款合同的条款进行调整，以减轻借款人的还款压力。常见的修改方式包括降低利率、延长贷款期限、减少月供或调整还款计划等。这一过程通常发生在借款人面临财务困难时，旨在避免违约或 foreclosure（止赎）。  
  **English Explanation**: Loan modification refers to the process where a borrower and a lender negotiate to alter the terms of an existing loan agreement to alleviate the borrower's repayment burden. Common modifications include lowering the interest rate, extending the loan term, reducing monthly payments, or adjusting the repayment schedule. This process typically occurs when a borrower faces financial hardship, aiming to prevent default or foreclosure.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：贷款修改广泛应用于个人住房贷款、商业贷款和学生贷款等领域。例如，在经济衰退期间，许多房主因收入下降而无法按时还款，通过与银行协商修改贷款条款，可以避免房屋被止赎。需要注意的是，贷款修改可能会影响借款人的信用评分，且并非所有申请都能获批。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Loan modification is widely applied in areas such as residential mortgages, commercial loans, and student loans. For instance, during economic downturns, many homeowners may struggle to make payments due to reduced income. By negotiating loan modifications with banks, they can avoid foreclosure. It’s important to note that loan modifications may impact the borrower’s credit score and not all applications are approved.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，贷款修改有助于维护金融系统的稳定性，减少不良资产；从投资角度看，它降低了违约风险，保护了投资者的利益；从行业角度看，它体现了金融机构的社会责任和风险管理能力。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, loan modification helps maintain financial system stability by reducing non-performing assets. From an investment standpoint, it lowers default risk and protects investor interests. From an industry perspective, it reflects financial institutions' social responsibility and risk management capabilities.
