# Loan Lock

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 贷款锁定（Loan Lock）是指借款人与贷款机构在贷款申请过程中达成的一项协议，确保在一定期限内贷款利率和条款保持不变。这一机制通常用于抵押贷款或房屋贷款，以保护借款人免受市场利率波动的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: A Loan Lock is an agreement between a borrower and a lender during the loan application process that guarantees the interest rate and terms of the loan will remain unchanged for a specified period. This mechanism is commonly used in mortgage or home loans to protect borrowers from market interest rate fluctuations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 贷款锁定主要应用于房屋贷款或抵押贷款场景。借款人在利率较低时选择锁定利率，以避免未来利率上升导致还款成本增加。然而，如果市场利率下降，借款人可能无法享受更低的利率，因此需谨慎评估风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Loan Locks are primarily applied in mortgage or home loan scenarios. Borrowers choose to lock in rates when interest rates are low to avoid increased repayment costs if rates rise in the future. However, if market rates fall, borrowers may not benefit from lower rates, so careful risk assessment is necessary.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，贷款锁定有助于稳定金融市场，减少因利率波动引发的违约风险。从投资和行业角度看，它为借款人提供了确定性，增强了购房者的信心，同时也为贷款机构提供了稳定的业务预期。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Loan Locks help stabilize financial markets by reducing default risks caused by interest rate fluctuations. From an investment and industry standpoint, they provide certainty for borrowers, boost homebuyer confidence, and offer stable business expectations for lenders.
