## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  贷款分级的起源可以追溯到20世纪初的美国银行业。当时，随着银行业务的扩展和复杂化，银行开始意识到需要对贷款进行系统化的风险评估。1929年的大萧条进一步推动了这一需求，促使银行开发出更为精细的贷款分类方法。中国的贷款分级制度则是在20世纪90年代随着金融改革的深入逐步引入和完善的。  
  The origin of loan grading can be traced back to the early 20th century in U.S. banking. As banking operations expanded and became more complex, banks began to recognize the need for systematic risk assessment of loans. The Great Depression of 1929 further accelerated this need, prompting banks to develop more refined loan classification methods. In China, the loan grading system was gradually introduced and refined during the financial reforms of the 1990s.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，贷款分级的实施显著提高了银行业的风险管理水平，减少了不良贷款的积累。同时，它也为中国金融市场的国际化奠定了基础。在全球范围内，贷款分级已成为银行业风险管理的重要标准之一，被广泛应用于各类金融机构中。  
  In China, the implementation of loan grading has significantly improved risk management in the banking sector and reduced the accumulation of non-performing loans. At the same time, it has laid the foundation for the internationalization of China's financial markets. Globally, loan grading has become one of the key standards for risk management in banking and is widely used by various financial institutions.
