## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**

  **Liquidation Preference** refers to the right of certain shareholders (typically preferred shareholders) to receive their investment principal and possibly additional returns before common shareholders in the event of a company's liquidation or sale. This right is usually stipulated in investment agreements to protect investors' interests.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在风险投资和私募股权领域，清算优先权被广泛使用，以确保投资者在公司失败或出售时能够优先收回资金。常见的应用场景包括公司破产、并购或资产出售。需要注意的是，过高的清算优先权可能会损害普通股股东的利益，甚至影响公司的融资能力。  
  In venture capital and private equity, liquidation preference is widely used to ensure that investors can recover their funds first in the event of a company's failure or sale. Common application scenarios include bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions, or asset sales. It is important to note that excessively high liquidation preferences may harm the interests of common shareholders and even affect the company's ability to raise funds.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和投资角度来看，清算优先权是保护投资者权益的重要工具，尤其是在高风险的投资环境中。它有助于吸引资本进入初创企业和高风险项目。然而，从行业角度来看，过度的清算优先权可能导致公司治理问题，影响长期发展。

It helps attract capital into startups and high-risk projects. However, from an industry perspective, excessive liquidation preferences may lead to corporate governance issues and affect long-term development.
