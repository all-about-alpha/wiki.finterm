  **English Explanation**: Long-Tail Liability refers to potential liabilities that may take a long time to fully manifest or resolve after an event has occurred. These liabilities are often associated with insurance, legal claims, or environmental issues, and their impact can persist for years or even decades. Key concepts include the delayed nature, uncertainty, and long-term duration of these liabilities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：长尾责任常见于保险行业，如职业责任保险、产品责任保险和环境责任保险。例如，石棉相关疾病的索赔可能在被保险人停止使用石棉多年后才出现。风险提示包括难以准确预测未来索赔金额和时间，以及可能对保险公司财务稳定性的长期影响。  
  **English Application**: Long-Tail Liabilities are prevalent in the insurance industry, such as professional liability insurance, product liability insurance, and environmental liability insurance. For instance, claims related to asbestos-related diseases may arise many years after the insured has ceased using asbestos. Risks include the difficulty in accurately predicting future claim amounts and timing, as well as the potential long-term impact on an insurer's financial stability.

  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Long-Tail Liabilities require insurers to maintain adequate reserves for potential future claims; from an investment perspective, investors need to assess a company's ability to manage these liabilities; from an industry perspective, the existence of Long-Tail Liabilities drives insurers to develop more accurate risk assessment models and products.
