## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  低利率环境的起源可追溯至20世纪的经济大萧条时期，当时各国央行开始采用宽松货币政策以刺激经济。2008年全球金融危机后，美联储、欧洲央行等主要央行进一步推行量化宽松政策，将利率降至历史低位。  
  The origin of the low interest rate environment can be traced back to the Great Depression of the 20th century when central banks began adopting loose monetary policies to stimulate economies. After the 2008 global financial crisis, major central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank further implemented quantitative easing policies, driving rates to historic lows.

  低利率环境对全球经济产生了深远影响：一方面推动了股市和房地产市场的繁荣；另一方面也加剧了债务水平和金融风险。目前，许多国家仍在探索如何平衡低利率政策的利弊。  
  The low interest rate environment has had profound impacts on the global economy: on one hand, it has fueled booms in stock and real estate markets; on the other hand, it has exacerbated debt levels and financial risks. Currently, many countries are still exploring how to balance the pros and cons of low interest rate policies.
