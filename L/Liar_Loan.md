  **中文解释**：Liar Loan（谎言贷款）是指借款人在申请贷款时，故意提供虚假或误导性的信息，以获取贷款资格或更优惠的贷款条件。这类贷款通常缺乏严格的审核流程，导致借款人可能无法真实反映其还款能力。  
  **English Explanation**: A Liar Loan refers to a loan where the borrower intentionally provides false or misleading information during the application process to qualify for the loan or secure more favorable terms. These loans often lack rigorous verification processes, potentially misrepresenting the borrower's actual repayment capacity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：Liar Loan常见于次级抵押贷款市场，尤其是在2008年全球金融危机之前。借款人通过虚报收入、资产或就业状况来获得贷款，而金融机构在追求高利润的同时放松了审核标准。这种行为增加了金融系统的风险，最终导致大量违约和金融危机。  
  **English Explanation**: Liar Loans were prevalent in the subprime mortgage market, particularly before the 2008 global financial crisis. Borrowers falsified income, assets, or employment status to secure loans, while financial institutions relaxed verification standards in pursuit of higher profits. This behavior increased systemic risk, ultimately leading to widespread defaults and financial crises.

  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，Liar Loan暴露了金融体系中的漏洞，促使各国加强了对贷款审核的监管。从投资角度看，这类贷款的高风险性提醒投资者需谨慎评估资产质量。从行业角度看，它推动了金融机构对风险管理流程的改进。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Liar Loans highlighted vulnerabilities in the financial system, prompting stricter oversight of loan verification processes.

From an industry perspective, they drove improvements in risk management practices among financial institutions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：Liar Loan的起源可以追溯到20世纪90年代末至21世纪初的美国房地产市场繁荣期。随着房价持续上涨，金融机构为了扩大市场份额，开始放宽贷款标准。一些经纪人和借款人利用这一机会，通过虚报信息获取贷款。这一现象在2006-2007年达到顶峰，成为次贷危机的重要诱因之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of Liar Loans can be traced back to the U.S. housing market boom from the late 1990s to early 2000s. As home prices soared, financial institutions relaxed lending standards to expand market share. Some brokers and borrowers exploited this opportunity by falsifying information to obtain loans. This practice peaked in 2006-2007 and became a significant contributor to the subprime mortgage crisis.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：Liar Loan的泛滥直接导致了次贷危机的爆发，引发了全球金融市场的动荡和经济的衰退。危机后，各国政府和监管机构加强了对金融市场的监管力度，《多德-弗兰克法案》等法规应运而生。如今，“谎言贷款”已成为金融风险管理的反面教材。  
  **English Explanation**: The proliferation of Liar Loans directly triggered the subprime mortgage crisis, causing turmoil in global financial markets and economic recession. Post-crisis, governments and regulators worldwide strengthened oversight of financial markets, leading to legislation like the Dodd-Frank Act. Today, "liar loans" serve as a cautionary tale in financial risk management.
