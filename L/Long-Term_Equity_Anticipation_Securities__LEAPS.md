# Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：长期股权预期证券（LEAPS）是一种长期期权合约，允许投资者在未来某一特定日期以预定价格买入或卖出标的股票。LEAPS的期限通常为一年以上，最长可达三年。这类证券由芝加哥期权交易所（CBOE）于1990年首次推出，旨在为投资者提供更长期的股票市场风险对冲和投机工具。  
  **English Explanation**: Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) are long-term options contracts that allow investors to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price on or before a specific future date. LEAPS typically have expiration dates ranging from over one year to up to three years. These securities were first introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1990, providing investors with a tool for long-term hedging and speculation in the stock market.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：LEAPS主要用于长期投资策略，如对冲股票组合风险、锁定未来买入价格或进行长期投机。投资者可以通过买入看涨LEAPS来锁定未来买入股票的价格，或通过买入看跌LEAPS来对冲股票下跌风险。需要注意的是，LEAPS虽然期限较长，但仍具有期权的时间价值衰减特性，且流动性可能不如短期期权。  
  **English Explanation**: LEAPS are primarily used in long-term investment strategies, such as hedging portfolio risks, locking in future purchase prices, or engaging in long-term speculation. Investors can buy call LEAPS to lock in future stock purchase prices or buy put LEAPS to hedge against potential stock price declines. It is important to note that while LEAPS have longer durations, they still exhibit time decay characteristics of options and may have lower liquidity compared to short-term options.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，LEAPS为市场提供了更灵活的风险管理工具，有助于提升市场稳定性。从投资角度看，LEAPS为投资者提供了长期参与股票市场的低成本方式，同时降低了短期市场波动的影响。从行业角度看，LEAPS的推出丰富了衍生品市场的产品线，促进了金融创新。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, LEAPS provide a more flexible risk management tool for the market, contributing to market stability. From an investment standpoint, LEAPS offer investors a low-cost way to participate in the stock market over the long term while mitigating the impact of short-term market volatility. From an industry perspective, the introduction of LEAPS has enriched the product line of the derivatives market and fostered financial innovation.
