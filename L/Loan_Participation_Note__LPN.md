# Loan Participation Note (LPN)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：贷款参与凭证（Loan Participation Note, LPN）是一种金融工具，允许投资者通过购买该凭证间接参与某一贷款的投资。通常由银行或其他金融机构发行，LPN代表了对特定贷款或贷款组合的部分所有权。投资者通过LPN获得与贷款相关的利息和本金偿还，而无需直接持有贷款本身。  
  **English Explanation**: A Loan Participation Note (LPN) is a financial instrument that allows investors to indirectly participate in the investment of a loan by purchasing the note. Typically issued by banks or other financial institutions, an LPN represents partial ownership of a specific loan or a pool of loans.

They are often employed to diversify investment risks, enhance liquidity, and meet specific investment needs. However, investors should be aware of credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, as the performance of LPNs depends on the repayment status of the underlying loans.
