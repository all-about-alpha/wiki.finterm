## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  信用证的历史可以追溯到中世纪欧洲的商人贸易活动。当时，商人们为了减少长途贸易中的风险，开始使用类似信用证的工具来确保交易安全。现代信用证制度的形成则始于19世纪末至20世纪初，随着国际贸易的快速发展而逐步完善。1929年国际商会（ICC）发布的《跟单信用证统一惯例》（UCP）标志着信用证制度的标准化和国际化。  
  The history of Letters of Credit dates back to medieval European merchant trade activities. To mitigate risks in long-distance trade, merchants began using tools similar to LCs to ensure transaction security. The modern LC system emerged in the late 19th to early 20th century and was refined with the rapid development of international trade. The publication of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP) by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 1929 marked the standardization and globalization of the LC system.
