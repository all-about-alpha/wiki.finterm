# Classical Economics

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：古典经济学是18世纪末至19世纪中叶由亚当·斯密、大卫·李嘉图等经济学家创立的经济学派。其核心思想包括自由市场、劳动价值论、分工理论以及“看不见的手”理论，主张市场通过供需关系自发调节经济，反对政府过度干预。  
  **English Explanation**: Classical economics is an economic school founded by economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century. Its core ideas include the free market, labor theory of value, division of labor, and the "invisible hand" theory, advocating that markets regulate the economy spontaneously through supply and demand, and opposing excessive government intervention.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：古典经济学理论在现代经济政策中仍有广泛应用，例如自由贸易、税收政策设计和市场竞争机制的制定。然而，其假设完全理性市场和信息对称在现实中难以实现，可能导致市场失灵或经济波动。  
  **English Explanation**: Classical economic theories are still widely applied in modern economic policies, such as free trade, tax policy design, and the formulation of market competition mechanisms. However, its assumptions of perfectly rational markets and symmetric information are difficult to achieve in reality, potentially leading to market failures or economic fluctuations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，古典经济学为现代市场经济奠定了理论基础，推动了全球化进程。其自由市场理念对政策制定者、投资者和企业管理者具有重要指导意义，但也需结合现实条件进行调整。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, classical economics laid the theoretical foundation for modern market economies and facilitated globalization. Its free-market principles provide significant guidance for policymakers, investors, and business managers, though adjustments are needed to align with real-world conditions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：古典经济学的起源可追溯至1776年亚当·斯密发表的《国富论》，该书系统阐述了自由市场和经济分工的理论。随后，大卫·李嘉图在1817年出版的《政治经济学及赋税原理》中进一步发展了劳动价值论和比较优势理论。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of classical economics can be traced back to Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations* published in 1776, which systematically expounded the theories of the free market and economic division of labor. Later, David Ricardo further developed the labor theory of value and the theory of comparative advantage in his 1817 work *Principles of Political Economy and Taxation*.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：古典经济学对全球经济发展产生了深远影响，推动了工业革命和资本主义的兴起。其理论至今仍是经济学教育的基础，但在20世纪大萧条后，凯恩斯主义等新学派对其进行了补充和修正。  
  **English Explanation**: Classical economics has had a profound impact on global economic development, driving the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism. Its theories remain foundational in economic education, though they were supplemented and revised by new schools of thought, such as Keynesianism, after the Great Depression of the 20th century.
