# Corporate Veil

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：公司面纱（Corporate Veil）是公司法中的一个重要概念，指公司作为独立法人与其股东之间的法律隔离。这一概念最早由英国普通法确立，核心在于公司作为独立实体，其债务和责任通常不涉及股东个人财产。  
  **English Explanation**: The Corporate Veil is a fundamental concept in corporate law, referring to the legal separation between a company as an independent legal entity and its shareholders. Originating from English common law, the core idea is that a company, as a separate entity, is responsible for its own debts and liabilities, which generally do not extend to the personal assets of its shareholders.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：公司面纱在商业实践中广泛应用，例如在有限责任公司中，股东仅以其出资额为限对公司债务承担责任。然而，在特定情况下（如欺诈、滥用公司形式），法院可能“刺破公司面纱”（Pierce the Corporate Veil），要求股东承担个人责任。  
  **English Explanation**: The Corporate Veil is widely applied in business practices, such as in limited liability companies, where shareholders are only liable for the company's debts up to the amount of their investment. However, in specific cases (e.g., fraud, misuse of corporate form), courts may "pierce the corporate veil," holding shareholders personally liable.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：公司面纱对投资者、监管机构和行业具有重要意义。它保护股东免受公司债务的无限追索，鼓励投资和创新。同时，监管机构通过刺破公司面纱的机制，防止公司形式被滥用，维护市场公平。  
  **English Explanation**: The Corporate Veil is significant for investors, regulators, and industries. It protects shareholders from unlimited liability for company debts, encouraging investment and innovation. Meanwhile, regulators use the mechanism of piercing the corporate veil to prevent misuse of corporate forms and maintain market fairness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：公司面纱的概念起源于19世纪的英国普通法，最早在Salomon v. A. Salomon & Co. Ltd (1897)一案中得到明确。该案确立了公司作为独立法人的原则，即使公司由单一股东控制，其债务仍不涉及股东个人财产。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the Corporate Veil originated in 19th-century English common law and was clearly established in the case of Salomon v. A. Salomon & Co. Ltd (1897). This case affirmed the principle of a company as an independent legal entity, even if controlled by a single shareholder, with debts not extending to the shareholder's personal assets.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：公司面纱的确立对全球公司法产生了深远影响，成为现代公司制度的基石。在中国，这一概念被引入并应用于《公司法》，支持了市场经济的发展。然而，滥用公司形式的现象也促使立法和司法实践不断完善。  
  **English Explanation**: The establishment of the Corporate Veil has had a profound impact on global corporate law, becoming a cornerstone of modern corporate systems. In China, this concept was introduced and applied in the Company Law, supporting the development of the market economy.
