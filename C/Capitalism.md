## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资本主义是一种以私有制为基础的经济体系，其核心特征包括自由市场、竞争、利润动机以及资本积累。这一概念最早由亚当·斯密（Adam Smith）在《国富论》中系统阐述，强调“看不见的手”通过市场机制调节资源配置。资本主义的核心在于个人和企业通过生产和交换实现财富增长，同时政府干预较少。  
  **English Explanation**: Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership, characterized by free markets, competition, profit motive, and capital accumulation. The concept was systematically articulated by Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations*, emphasizing the "invisible hand" that regulates resource allocation through market mechanisms. At its core, capitalism focuses on individuals and businesses generating wealth through production and exchange, with minimal government intervention.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：资本主义广泛应用于全球大多数经济体，尤其是在欧美发达国家。其应用场景包括股票市场、企业运营、国际贸易等。然而，资本主义也面临贫富差距扩大、环境破坏等风险，需通过政策调控和社会责任加以平衡。  
  **English Explanation**: Capitalism is widely applied in most global economies, particularly in developed countries like those in Europe and North America. Its applications include stock markets, business operations, and international trade. However, capitalism also faces risks such as widening wealth inequality and environmental degradation, which require policy regulation and corporate social responsibility to address.
