# Compounding

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：复利（Compounding）是指投资收益再投资，从而产生新的收益的过程。复利的核心概念是“利滚利”，即利息或收益不仅基于初始本金，还基于之前累积的利息或收益。这一概念最早由数学家阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦称为“世界第八大奇迹”。  
  **English Explanation**: Compounding refers to the process where investment earnings are reinvested to generate additional earnings. The core concept of compounding is "interest on interest," meaning that returns are calculated not only on the initial principal but also on the accumulated interest or earnings from previous periods. This concept was famously referred to as the "eighth wonder of the world" by mathematician Albert Einstein.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：复利广泛应用于长期投资领域，如股票、债券、基金和退休储蓄计划。投资者通过复利效应，可以在较长时间内实现财富的指数级增长。然而，复利的效果依赖于时间、收益率和投资稳定性，因此投资者需注意市场波动和长期持有风险。  
  **English Application**: Compounding is widely applied in long-term investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and retirement savings plans. Through the power of compounding, investors can achieve exponential wealth growth over extended periods. However, the effectiveness of compounding depends on time, rate of return, and investment stability, so investors must be mindful of market volatility and long-term holding risks.

From an investment standpoint, compounding is a core tool for wealth accumulation. From an industry perspective, compounding promotes the adoption of long-term investment strategies and the healthy development of financial markets.
