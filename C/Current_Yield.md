# Current Yield

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    当前收益率（Current Yield）是指债券的年利息收入与其当前市场价格之间的比率。它反映了投资者在购买债券后，每年能够获得的利息收益相对于投资成本的百分比。计算公式为：当前收益率 = （年利息收入 / 债券当前市场价格） × 100%。  
    这一概念由金融市场中的债券定价理论衍生而来，核心在于衡量债券的即时收益能力，而非其到期收益。

  - **English Explanation**  
    Current Yield refers to the annual interest income of a bond divided by its current market price. It represents the percentage return an investor would earn from the bond's interest payments relative to its current market value. The formula is: Current Yield = (Annual Interest Income / Current Market Price of the Bond) × 100%.  
    This concept originates from bond pricing theory in financial markets, focusing on measuring the immediate income-generating ability of a bond rather than its yield to maturity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    当前收益率常用于债券投资分析中，帮助投资者比较不同债券的即时收益水平。例如，当市场利率波动时，债券价格会随之变化，当前收益率可以快速反映这种变化对投资者收益的影响。需要注意的是，当前收益率未考虑债券的到期收益或资本利得，因此不能全面反映债券的总回报。

  - **English Application**  
    Current Yield is widely used in bond investment analysis to help investors compare the immediate income potential of different bonds. For instance, when market interest rates fluctuate, bond prices change accordingly, and Current Yield quickly reflects the impact of these changes on investor returns. It is important to note that Current Yield does not account for a bond's yield to maturity or capital gains, so it does not fully represent the total return of a bond.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管角度看，当前收益率是评估债券市场透明度和定价效率的重要指标。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了衡量债券即时收益的简单工具，尤其适用于短期投资决策。从行业角度看，当前收益率是债券发行和交易中的重要参考指标，影响债券的定价和市场需求。

  - **English Significance**  
    From a regulatory perspective, Current Yield is an important metric for assessing the transparency and pricing efficiency of the bond market. From an investment standpoint, it provides a simple tool for investors to measure the immediate income potential of bonds, particularly for short-term investment decisions. From an industry perspective, Current Yield is a key reference in bond issuance and trading, influencing bond pricing and market demand.
