# Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  《综合预算协调法案》（COBRA）是美国于1985年通过的一项联邦法律，旨在为员工及其家属在失去工作或经历其他特定生活事件时，提供继续享受雇主提供的团体健康保险的机会。COBRA的核心概念是“延续保险”，允许符合条件的个人在特定情况下继续购买雇主提供的健康保险，通常需自费支付全额保费。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) is a federal law enacted in the United States in 1985. It provides employees and their families the right to continue their employer-sponsored group health insurance coverage after losing their job or experiencing other qualifying life events. The core concept of COBRA is "continuation coverage," allowing eligible individuals to maintain their health insurance under certain conditions, typically by paying the full premium themselves.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  COBRA适用于以下情况：员工被解雇（非严重不当行为）、工作时间减少、离婚或分居、员工死亡（家属继续保险）、员工符合医疗保险资格等。需要注意的是，COBRA保险通常费用较高，因为雇主不再承担部分保费，且覆盖期限有限（通常为18个月，某些情况下可延长至36个月）。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  COBRA applies in situations such as job loss (not due to gross misconduct), reduction in work hours, divorce or legal separation, death of the employee (allowing dependents to continue coverage), and eligibility for Medicare. It is important to note that COBRA coverage is often expensive because the employer no longer subsidizes the premium, and the coverage duration is limited (typically 18 months, extendable to 36 months in certain cases).

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，COBRA为员工提供了过渡期的健康保障，减少了因失业或生活变故导致的保险中断风险。从投资和行业角度看，COBRA有助于稳定劳动力市场，减轻雇主因员工流失带来的潜在法律和财务风险。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, COBRA provides transitional health coverage for employees, reducing the risk of insurance gaps due to job loss or life changes. From an investment and industry standpoint, COBRA helps stabilize the labor market and mitigates potential legal and financial risks for employers associated with employee turnover.
