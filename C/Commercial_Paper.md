* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  商业票据（Commercial Paper，简称CP）是一种由大型企业或金融机构发行的短期无担保债务工具，通常用于满足企业的短期融资需求。其期限一般在1天至270天之间，具有较高的流动性和较低的风险。商业票据的发行主体通常为信用评级较高的企业或金融机构，投资者多为机构投资者。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt instrument issued by large corporations or financial institutions, typically used to meet short-term financing needs. The maturity period usually ranges from 1 to 270 days, offering high liquidity and relatively low risk. Issuers are generally highly credit-rated entities, and investors are predominantly institutional.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  商业票据广泛应用于企业的日常运营资金周转，如支付供应商货款、工资发放等。由于其期限短、流动性强，企业可以通过发行商业票据快速获得资金。然而，商业票据的发行依赖于企业的信用评级，若企业信用状况恶化，可能导致融资成本上升或发行失败。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Commercial Paper is widely used for corporate working capital needs, such as paying suppliers or meeting payroll obligations. Due to its short maturity and high liquidity, companies can quickly raise funds by issuing CP. However, issuance relies heavily on the issuer's credit rating; a deterioration in creditworthiness can lead to higher financing costs or failed issuance.
