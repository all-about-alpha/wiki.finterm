# Clawback

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  Clawback（追回条款）是一种合同或政策条款，允许公司在特定情况下收回已支付给员工或高管的奖金、薪酬或其他福利。这一机制通常用于应对财务重述、欺诈行为或业绩不达标等情况，以确保薪酬与公司实际表现相符。该条款最早由美国《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》（Sarbanes-Oxley Act）引入，旨在加强公司治理和财务透明度。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A clawback is a contractual or policy provision that allows a company to reclaim bonuses, compensation, or other benefits previously paid to employees or executives under specific circumstances, such as financial restatements, fraudulent activities, or failure to meet performance targets. This mechanism ensures that compensation aligns with the company's actual performance. The concept was first introduced by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States to enhance corporate governance and financial transparency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  Clawback条款广泛应用于上市公司、金融机构和高管薪酬计划中。例如，当公司因财务造假或错误重述财务报表时，董事会可依据Clawback条款追回已发放的高管奖金。此外，私募股权和风险投资基金也可能在投资协议中加入Clawback条款，以确保基金管理人的收益与基金实际表现挂钩。需要注意的是，Clawback的执行可能涉及法律纠纷和复杂的计算过程。  
  **English Application**：  
  Clawback provisions are widely used in publicly traded companies, financial institutions, and executive compensation plans. For instance, if a company restates its financial statements due to fraud or errors, the board of directors can invoke the clawback clause to reclaim bonuses paid to executives. Similarly, private equity and venture capital funds may include clawback provisions in investment agreements to align fund managers' profits with the fund's actual performance. However, enforcing clawbacks can lead to legal disputes and complex calculations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  Clawback条款的起源可以追溯到2002年美国的《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》。该法案是在安然（Enron）和世通（WorldCom）等公司财务丑闻爆发后制定的，旨在加强公司财务报告的透明度和问责制。法案第304条明确要求，若公司因不当行为重述财务报表，CEO和CFO必须返还奖金和股票收益。此后，Clawback条款逐渐被全球金融监管机构和公司采纳。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of clawback provisions originated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the United States. This legislation was enacted in response to financial scandals involving companies like Enron and WorldCom, aiming to enhance the transparency and accountability of corporate financial reporting. Section 304 of the Act mandates that CEOs and CFOs must return bonuses and stock profits if financial statements are restated due to misconduct. Since then, clawback provisions have been widely adopted by financial regulators and companies globally.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  Clawback条款的引入对全球公司治理产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了高管的责任感，还促使公司建立更严格的内部控制机制。在中国，随着资本市场改革的推进，Clawback条款也逐渐被纳入上市公司治理准则中。例如，中国证监会发布的《上市公司治理准则》明确要求上市公司在特定情况下追回高管薪酬。目前，Clawback机制已成为全球金融监管的重要工具之一。  
  **English Impact**：  
  The introduction of clawback provisions has had a profound impact on global corporate governance. It has not only increased the accountability of executives but also encouraged companies to establish stricter internal control mechanisms. In China, as capital market reforms progress, clawback provisions have been gradually incorporated into corporate governance guidelines for listed companies. For example, the China Securities Regulatory Commission's "Guidelines for Corporate Governance of Listed Companies" explicitly requires listed companies to reclaim executive compensation under specific circumstances. Today, clawback mechanisms are an essential tool in global financial regulation.
