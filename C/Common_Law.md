## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    普通法（Common Law）是一种以判例为基础的法律体系，起源于英国。其核心概念是“遵循先例”（stare decisis），即法院在判决案件时需参考先前类似案件的判决结果。普通法强调法官在案件中的解释和裁决作用，而非完全依赖成文法。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Common Law is a legal system based on judicial precedents, originating in England. Its core concept is "stare decisis," meaning that courts are bound to follow the rulings of previous cases with similar facts. Common Law emphasizes the role of judges in interpreting and deciding cases, rather than relying solely on statutory laws.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    普通法广泛应用于英美法系国家，如美国、加拿大、澳大利亚等。在这些国家，法院的判决不仅解决具体案件，还形成具有约束力的判例，为后续类似案件提供法律依据。普通法在合同法、侵权法、财产法等领域尤为重要。需要注意的是，普通法的灵活性可能导致法律的不确定性，尤其是在缺乏明确先例的情况下。  
  - **English Application**  
    Common Law is widely applied in countries with Anglo-American legal systems, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. In these countries, court decisions not only resolve specific cases but also create binding precedents that guide future cases. Common Law is particularly significant in areas like contract law, tort law, and property law. However, its flexibility can lead to legal uncertainty, especially in the absence of clear precedents.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**  
    从监管、投资和行业角度来看，普通法体系为法律实践提供了高度的灵活性和适应性，能够随着社会和经济的变化而发展。对于投资者而言，普通法国家的法律环境通常被认为更加透明和可预测，因为判例法提供了明确的法律指引。此外，普通法对全球商业法律框架的形成产生了深远影响。  
  - **English Significance**  
    From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Common Law system offers high flexibility and adaptability, allowing it to evolve with societal and economic changes. For investors, legal environments in Common Law countries are often seen as more transparent and predictable due to the clear guidance provided by case law. Additionally, Common Law has profoundly influenced the global commercial legal framework.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    普通法起源于12世纪的英格兰，当时国王亨利二世为了加强中央集权，建立了统一的司法体系。通过派遣巡回法官到各地审理案件，逐渐形成了以判例为基础的法律体系。这一体系后来通过英国的殖民扩张传播到世界各地，成为英美法系的基础。  
  - **English Origin**  
    Common Law originated in 12th-century England during the reign of King Henry II, who sought to centralize judicial power by establishing a unified legal system. By sending traveling judges to adjudicate cases across the country, a precedent-based legal system gradually developed. This system later spread globally through British colonial expansion, forming the foundation of the Anglo-American legal tradition.

* **影响 / Impact**

    普通法对全球法律体系产生了深远影响，尤其是在英美法系国家。它不仅塑造了这些国家的法律框架，还影响了国际商业法和跨国争端解决机制。如今，普通法仍然是许多国家法律体系的核心，并在全球范围内被广泛研究和应用。  
  - **English Impact**  
    Common Law has had a profound impact on global legal systems, particularly in countries with Anglo-American legal traditions.
