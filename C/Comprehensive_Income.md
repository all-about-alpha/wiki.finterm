## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  综合收益的概念起源于20世纪80年代，由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）提出。当时，随着金融工具的复杂化和国际化，传统的净利润指标已无法全面反映企业的财务表现。FASB在1984年发布的《财务会计准则公告第5号》（SFAS No. 5）中首次引入了综合收益的概念。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of Comprehensive Income originated in the 1980s, introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). At that time, with the increasing complexity and internationalization of financial instruments, traditional net income metrics were no longer sufficient to fully reflect a company's financial performance. FASB first introduced the concept of Comprehensive Income in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (SFAS No. 5) in 1984.
