# Core Inflation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  核心通胀（Core Inflation）是指剔除食品和能源价格波动后的通货膨胀率。由于食品和能源价格容易受到季节性因素和短期市场波动的影响，核心通胀被视为更能反映经济中长期价格趋势的指标。这一概念最早由经济学家提出，旨在帮助政策制定者更好地理解通胀的根本驱动力。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Core Inflation refers to the inflation rate excluding the volatile prices of food and energy. Since food and energy prices are prone to seasonal factors and short-term market fluctuations, core inflation is considered a more accurate reflection of long-term price trends in the economy. This concept was initially proposed by economists to help policymakers better understand the underlying drivers of inflation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  核心通胀常用于货币政策制定中，尤其是在央行决定是否调整利率时。例如，美联储（Fed）和中国人民银行（PBOC）都会参考核心通胀数据来评估经济的健康状况。需要注意的是，核心通胀忽略了食品和能源价格，而这些价格对普通消费者的生活成本有直接影响，因此在分析通胀对民生的影响时，需结合整体通胀数据。  
  **English Application**  
  Core inflation is frequently used in monetary policy formulation, particularly when central banks decide whether to adjust interest rates. For instance, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC) both refer to core inflation data to assess the health of the economy. It is important to note that core inflation excludes food and energy prices, which directly impact the cost of living for ordinary consumers. Therefore, when analyzing the impact of inflation on livelihoods, it is necessary to consider overall inflation data alongside core inflation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，核心通胀是央行制定货币政策的重要依据，因为它能更稳定地反映经济中的价格压力。从投资角度看，核心通胀数据有助于投资者判断未来利率走势，从而调整资产配置。从行业角度看，核心通胀的变化会影响企业的定价策略和成本管理。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, core inflation is a crucial basis for central banks to formulate monetary policies, as it provides a more stable reflection of price pressures in the economy. From an investment perspective, core inflation data helps investors predict future interest rate trends and adjust asset allocation accordingly. From an industry perspective, changes in core inflation influence corporate pricing strategies and cost management.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  核心通胀的概念起源于20世纪70年代，当时全球经历了石油危机，能源价格剧烈波动，导致整体通胀数据失真。经济学家提出剔除能源和食品价格，以更准确地衡量通胀趋势。这一方法逐渐被各国央行采纳，成为衡量经济健康的重要指标。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of core inflation originated in the 1970s during the global oil crisis, when energy prices experienced extreme volatility, distorting overall inflation data. Economists proposed excluding energy and food prices to more accurately measure inflation trends. This method was gradually adopted by central banks worldwide and became a key indicator for assessing economic health.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  核心通胀的提出对全球货币政策产生了深远影响。它帮助央行在制定政策时避免被短期价格波动干扰，从而更专注于控制中长期通胀目标。目前，核心通胀已成为各国央行和金融机构的重要参考指标，广泛应用于宏观经济分析和政策制定中。  
  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of core inflation has had a profound impact on global monetary policy. It helps central banks avoid being misled by short-term price fluctuations when formulating policies, allowing them to focus more on controlling medium- to long-term inflation targets. Today, core inflation has become a key reference indicator for central banks and financial institutions worldwide, widely used in macroeconomic analysis and policy formulation.
