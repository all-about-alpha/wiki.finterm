# Custodial Account

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：托管账户（Custodial Account）是一种由第三方机构（如银行、信托公司或经纪公司）代表账户持有人管理和保管资产的金融账户。通常用于为未成年人或无法自行管理资产的个人持有和管理资金或投资。托管人负责按照账户持有人的指示或法律规定进行资产操作，但资产的所有权仍归账户持有人所有。  
  **English Explanation**: A custodial account is a financial account managed and maintained by a third-party institution (such as a bank, trust company, or brokerage firm) on behalf of the account holder. It is commonly used to hold and manage funds or investments for minors or individuals who are unable to manage their own assets. The custodian is responsible for executing transactions according to the account holder's instructions or legal requirements, while the ownership of the assets remains with the account holder.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：托管账户广泛应用于教育储蓄、遗产规划以及为未成年人设立的投资账户。例如，家长可以为子女开设托管账户，用于未来的教育费用。托管账户也常用于管理信托资产或为特殊需求人士（如残疾人）提供财务支持。需要注意的是，托管账户的资产在账户持有人达到法定年龄或满足特定条件时，将完全转移给账户持有人，托管人不再拥有控制权。  
  **English Application**: Custodial accounts are widely used for education savings, estate planning, and investment accounts for minors. For example, parents can open custodial accounts for their children to save for future educational expenses. They are also commonly used to manage trust assets or provide financial support for individuals with special needs (e.g., disabled persons). It is important to note that the assets in a custodial account are fully transferred to the account holder once they reach the legal age or meet specific conditions, and the custodian no longer retains control.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：托管账户的概念最早可追溯到19世纪的信托法和遗产管理实践。随着现代金融体系的发展，20世纪初，美国通过了《统一赠与未成年人法案》（UGMA）和《统一转移给未成年人法案》（UTMA），正式确立了托管账户的法律框架。这些法案为父母或监护人为未成年人设立账户提供了法律依据，并逐步在全球范围内推广。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of custodial accounts dates back to the 19th century, rooted in trust law and estate management practices. With the development of modern financial systems, the United States enacted the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) in the early 20th century, formally establishing the legal framework for custodial accounts. These acts provided a legal basis for parents or guardians to set up accounts for minors and gradually gained global adoption.
