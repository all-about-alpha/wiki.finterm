# Credit Risk

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：信用风险（Credit Risk）是指借款人未能按照合同约定履行还款义务，导致贷款人或投资人遭受损失的可能性。这一概念最早由银行和金融机构在评估贷款违约风险时提出，核心在于评估借款人的还款能力和意愿。  
  **English Explanation**: Credit Risk refers to the potential that a borrower will fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed terms, leading to financial loss for the lender or investor. This concept originated from banks and financial institutions assessing the risk of loan defaults, focusing on the borrower's ability and willingness to repay.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：信用风险广泛应用于银行贷款、债券投资、信用卡业务等领域。在贷款业务中，银行通过信用评分模型评估借款人的信用风险；在债券投资中，投资者通过信用评级机构（如标普、穆迪）发布的评级来判断债券的信用风险。需要注意的是，信用风险不仅存在于传统金融领域，也存在于互联网金融、供应链金融等新兴领域。  
  **English Explanation**: Credit Risk is widely applied in areas such as bank lending, bond investments, and credit card services. In lending, banks use credit scoring models to assess borrowers' credit risk; in bond investments, investors rely on credit ratings from agencies like S&P and Moody's to evaluate risk. It is important to note that credit risk exists not only in traditional finance but also in emerging fields like internet finance and supply chain finance.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，信用风险是金融机构风险管理的重要组成部分，监管机构（如中国银保监会）要求银行建立完善的信用风险管理体系。从投资角度看，信用风险直接影响投资组合的收益和稳定性。从行业角度看，信用风险管理的有效性决定了金融机构的竞争力和可持续发展能力。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, credit risk is a critical component of risk management for financial institutions, with regulators (e.g., China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission) requiring banks to establish robust credit risk management systems. From an investment perspective, credit risk directly impacts the returns and stability of investment portfolios. From an industry perspective, the effectiveness of credit risk management determines the competitiveness and sustainability of financial institutions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：信用风险的概念可以追溯到中世纪欧洲的银行业。当时，意大利的银行家们开始记录借款人的还款行为，并以此为基础评估其信用。19世纪末，随着现代银行业的兴起，信用风险逐渐成为金融领域的核心议题。20世纪初，信用评级机构的出现（如1909年穆迪公司成立）标志着信用风险管理的系统化发展。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of credit risk dates back to medieval European banking, where Italian bankers began recording borrowers' repayment behaviors to assess their creditworthiness. By the late 19th century, with the rise of modern banking, credit risk became a central issue in finance. The establishment of credit rating agencies in the early 20th century (e.g., Moody's in 1909) marked the systematic development of credit risk management.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：信用风险对全球金融体系产生了深远影响。2008年全球金融危机就是由次级贷款信用风险的集中爆发引发的。此后，各国监管机构加强了对信用风险的监管，推动了巴塞尔协议III的实施。目前，信用风险管理已成为金融机构的核心竞争力之一，尤其是在金融科技快速发展的背景下，信用风险评估技术也在不断创新。  
  **English Explanation**: Credit risk has had a profound impact on the global financial system. The 2008 financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of subprime mortgage credit risk, led to stricter regulatory oversight worldwide and the implementation of Basel III. Today, credit risk management is a core competency for financial institutions, especially with the rapid development of fintech, which has spurred continuous innovation in credit risk assessment technologies.
