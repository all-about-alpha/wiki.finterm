# Currency Risk

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：货币风险（Currency Risk），又称汇率风险，是指由于汇率波动导致投资者或企业在持有或交易外币资产、负债或进行跨境交易时，可能面临的财务损失风险。这一概念最早由国际金融学者在研究跨国投资和贸易时提出，核心在于汇率的不确定性对经济主体的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Currency risk, also known as exchange rate risk, refers to the potential financial loss that investors or businesses may face due to fluctuations in exchange rates when holding or trading foreign currency assets, liabilities, or engaging in cross-border transactions. This concept was initially introduced by international finance scholars studying cross-border investments and trade, with its core focus on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty on economic entities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：货币风险广泛应用于国际贸易、跨国投资、外汇交易等领域。例如，中国企业从美国进口设备并以美元结算，若人民币对美元贬值，企业将面临更高的成本。此外，投资者持有外币资产时，汇率波动可能导致资产价值缩水。风险防范措施包括使用外汇对冲工具（如远期合约、期权）或调整资产负债结构。  
  **English Explanation**: Currency risk is widely applied in international trade, cross-border investments, and foreign exchange trading. For example, if a Chinese company imports equipment from the United States and settles the transaction in US dollars, a depreciation of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar would increase the company's costs. Additionally, investors holding foreign currency assets may face a decline in asset value due to exchange rate fluctuations. Risk mitigation measures include using hedging instruments (such as forward contracts or options) or adjusting the structure of assets and liabilities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，货币风险是金融机构风险管理的重要组成部分，监管机构要求银行和跨国公司定期评估并披露汇率风险敞口。从投资角度看，汇率波动直接影响跨国投资回报率，投资者需将其纳入决策框架。从行业角度看，全球化背景下，货币风险管理能力成为企业核心竞争力的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, currency risk is a critical component of risk management for financial institutions, with regulators requiring banks and multinational corporations to regularly assess and disclose their exchange rate risk exposure. From an investment perspective, exchange rate fluctuations directly impact the returns on cross-border investments, necessitating their inclusion in decision-making frameworks. From an industry perspective, in the context of globalization, the ability to manage currency risk has become a key component of a company's core competitiveness.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：货币风险的概念起源于20世纪70年代布雷顿森林体系崩溃后。在此之前，全球汇率体系以固定汇率为基础，汇率波动较小。1971年，美国宣布美元与黄金脱钩，全球进入浮动汇率时代，汇率波动加剧，货币风险逐渐成为国际金融领域的重要议题。学者如罗伯特·蒙代尔（Robert Mundell）和马库斯·弗莱明（Marcus Fleming）通过研究开放经济下的货币政策，为货币风险理论奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of currency risk emerged in the 1970s following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Prior to this, the global exchange rate system was based on fixed rates, with minimal fluctuations. In 1971, the United States decoupled the US dollar from gold, ushering in an era of floating exchange rates and increased volatility. Currency risk gradually became a significant topic in international finance. Scholars such as Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming laid the theoretical foundation for currency risk through their research on monetary policy in open economies.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：货币风险对全球经济产生了深远影响。例如，1997年亚洲金融危机中，泰铢大幅贬值引发连锁反应，导致多个亚洲国家经济崩溃。如今，随着全球化深入，货币风险已成为跨国企业和投资者日常运营中不可忽视的因素。中国作为全球第二大经济体，人民币国际化进程中的汇率波动也对全球市场产生重要影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Currency risk has had a profound impact on the global economy. For instance, during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the sharp depreciation of the Thai baht triggered a chain reaction, leading to economic collapses in several Asian countries. Today, with the deepening of globalization, currency risk has become an unavoidable factor in the daily operations of multinational corporations and investors. As the world's second-largest economy, China's exchange rate fluctuations during the internationalization of the yuan also significantly impact global markets.
