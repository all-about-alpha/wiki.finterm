# Cash Flow Statement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：现金流量表是一种财务报表，用于反映企业在一定会计期间内现金及现金等价物的流入和流出情况。它由经营活动、投资活动和筹资活动三部分构成，是评估企业财务健康状况的重要工具。现金流量表的概念最早由美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）在1987年正式提出，并成为国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的核心组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: A cash flow statement is a financial report that shows the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents during a specific accounting period. It consists of three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. It is a critical tool for assessing a company's financial health. The concept was formally introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 1987 and has since become a core component of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：现金流量表广泛应用于企业财务分析、投资决策和信用评级等领域。通过分析现金流量表，投资者可以判断企业的盈利质量、偿债能力和资金运作效率。需要注意的是，现金流量表并不能完全反映企业的非现金交易（如折旧、摊销等），因此需结合利润表和资产负债表进行综合评估。  
  **English Explanation**: The cash flow statement is widely used in financial analysis, investment decision-making, and credit rating. By analyzing the cash flow statement, investors can assess a company's profitability quality, debt repayment ability, and capital operation efficiency. It is important to note that the cash flow statement does not fully reflect non-cash transactions (such as depreciation and amortization), so it should be evaluated alongside the income statement and balance sheet.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，现金流量表是上市公司必须披露的财务报表之一，有助于监管机构监控企业的资金流动情况。从投资角度看，现金流量表能帮助投资者识别企业的真实盈利能力和财务风险。从行业角度看，现金流量表是衡量企业现金流管理能力的重要指标，尤其在资本密集型行业中尤为重要。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the cash flow statement is one of the mandatory financial reports for listed companies, helping regulators monitor corporate cash flows. From an investment perspective, it assists investors in identifying a company's true profitability and financial risks. From an industry perspective, it is a key metric for evaluating a company's cash flow management capabilities, especially in capital-intensive industries.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：现金流量表的概念起源于20世纪中期，随着企业财务管理的复杂化，传统的利润表和资产负债表已无法全面反映企业的资金状况。1987年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）正式发布《财务会计准则第95号》（SFAS 95），要求企业编制现金流量表。这一准则后来被国际会计准则委员会（IASB）采纳，并成为全球通用的财务报告标准。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the cash flow statement originated in the mid-20th century as traditional income statements and balance sheets became insufficient to fully reflect a company's financial status. In 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 (SFAS 95), mandating the preparation of cash flow statements. This standard was later adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and became a globally accepted financial reporting standard.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：现金流量表的引入极大地提升了企业财务透明度，使投资者和债权人能够更准确地评估企业的财务健康状况。如今，现金流量表已成为全球企业财务报告的核心组成部分，尤其在金融危机期间，其重要性更加凸显。  
  **English Explanation**: The introduction of the cash flow statement significantly enhanced corporate financial transparency, enabling investors and creditors to more accurately assess a company's financial health. Today, the cash flow statement is a core component of global corporate financial reporting, with its importance particularly highlighted during financial crises.
