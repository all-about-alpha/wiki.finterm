# Credit Default Swap (CDS)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：信用违约互换（Credit Default Swap, CDS）是一种金融衍生工具，用于转移信用风险。它由买方（通常是银行或投资者）和卖方（通常是保险公司或对冲基金）签订合约，买方定期向卖方支付费用，以换取在特定债务工具（如债券或贷款）发生违约时获得赔偿的权利。CDS的核心概念是通过合约将信用风险从一方转移到另一方。  
  - **English Explanation**: A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial derivative used to transfer credit risk. It is a contract between a buyer (typically a bank or investor) and a seller (often an insurance company or hedge fund), where the buyer makes periodic payments to the seller in exchange for the right to receive compensation if a specific debt instrument (such as a bond or loan) defaults. The core concept of a CDS is to transfer credit risk from one party to another through the contract.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：CDS广泛应用于银行、保险公司和对冲基金等金融机构。银行可以通过购买CDS来对冲贷款组合的信用风险，而保险公司则可以通过出售CDS获得额外收益。然而，CDS也存在风险，如对手方风险（即卖方无法履行赔付义务）和市场流动性风险。  
  - **English Application**: CDS is widely used by financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and hedge funds. Banks can purchase CDS to hedge credit risk in their loan portfolios, while insurance companies can earn additional income by selling CDS. However, CDS also carries risks, such as counterparty risk (the seller may fail to fulfill the payment obligation) and market liquidity risk.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，CDS有助于分散信用风险，但也可能引发系统性风险，如2008年金融危机中CDS市场的崩溃。从投资角度看，CDS为投资者提供了对冲工具和投机机会。从行业角度看，CDS市场的发展推动了金融创新和风险管理工具的多样化。  
  - **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, CDS helps disperse credit risk but may also trigger systemic risks, as seen in the collapse of the CDS market during the 2008 financial crisis. From an investment perspective, CDS provides hedging tools and speculative opportunities for investors. From an industry perspective, the development of the CDS market has driven financial innovation and diversified risk management tools.
