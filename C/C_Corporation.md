# C Corporation

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：C Corporation（C型公司）是美国税法中的一种公司形式，以其独立的法律实体身份和双重征税特征而闻名。C Corporation的股东对公司债务承担有限责任，公司利润在公司层面缴纳企业所得税后，股东还需对分红缴纳个人所得税，形成“双重征税”。这种公司形式由美国国内税收法典（Internal Revenue Code）定义，适用于大多数大型企业和上市公司。  
  **English Explanation**: A C Corporation is a type of corporate structure under U.S. tax law, known for its status as a separate legal entity and its characteristic of double taxation. Shareholders of a C Corporation have limited liability for the company's debts. The corporation's profits are taxed at the corporate level, and shareholders are also taxed on dividends, resulting in "double taxation." This structure is defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and is commonly used by large businesses and publicly traded companies.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：C Corporation广泛应用于需要融资或计划上市的企业，因其股东人数不受限制且股票可自由交易。此外，C Corporation适合跨国企业，因其税务结构便于全球业务扩展。然而，双重征税是其主要风险，企业需谨慎规划税务策略以减轻负担。  
  **English Application**: C Corporations are widely used by businesses seeking financing or planning to go public, as there are no restrictions on the number of shareholders and their shares can be freely traded. Additionally, C Corporations are suitable for multinational companies due to their tax structure, which facilitates global expansion. However, double taxation is a significant risk, requiring careful tax planning to mitigate the burden.

  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，C Corporation的独立法人地位使其在合规和法律责任方面更具优势。从投资角度看，C Corporation的股票流动性高，吸引了大量投资者。从行业角度看，C Corporation是推动经济增长和技术创新的重要力量，尤其在科技和金融领域。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the separate legal entity status of a C Corporation provides advantages in compliance and legal liability. From an investment standpoint, the high liquidity of C Corporation shares attracts a large number of investors. From an industry perspective, C Corporations are a driving force behind economic growth and technological innovation, particularly in the tech and finance sectors.
