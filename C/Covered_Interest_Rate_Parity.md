# Covered Interest Rate Parity

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  抛补利率平价（Covered Interest Rate Parity, CIRP）是国际金融中的一个重要理论，由经济学家在20世纪初提出。它描述了在无套利条件下，远期汇率与即期汇率之间的关系，以及两国利率差异对汇率的影响。核心概念是：投资者通过外汇远期合约锁定汇率后，两国资产的收益率应相等，否则将存在套利机会。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIRP) is a fundamental theory in international finance, developed by economists in the early 20th century. It describes the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates under no-arbitrage conditions, and how interest rate differentials between two countries affect exchange rates. The core concept is that, after locking in exchange rates through forward contracts, the returns on assets in both countries should be equal; otherwise, arbitrage opportunities would exist.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  抛补利率平价广泛应用于外汇市场套期保值、跨国投资决策以及央行货币政策制定。例如，企业利用远期合约对冲汇率风险，或投资者通过比较两国利率差异判断汇率走势。需要注意的是，市场摩擦（如交易成本、资本管制）可能导致理论偏离实际。  
  **English Application**  
  CIRP is widely used in hedging foreign exchange risks, cross-border investment decisions, and central bank monetary policy formulation. For instance, companies use forward contracts to hedge currency risks, or investors compare interest rate differentials to predict exchange rate movements. It is important to note that market frictions (e.g., transaction costs, capital controls) may cause deviations from the theory.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，抛补利率平价是评估外汇市场有效性的重要工具；从投资角度看，它为跨国资产配置提供了理论依据；从行业角度看，它帮助金融机构设计更精准的汇率风险管理工具。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, CIRP is a key tool for assessing foreign exchange market efficiency. From an investment perspective, it provides a theoretical basis for cross-border asset allocation. From an industry perspective, it helps financial institutions design more accurate currency risk management tools.
