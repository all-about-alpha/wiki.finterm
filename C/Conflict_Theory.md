## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：冲突理论（Conflict Theory）是一种社会学理论，最早由卡尔·马克思（Karl Marx）提出，核心观点认为社会是由不同利益群体之间的冲突和斗争驱动的。在金融领域，冲突理论被用来解释不同利益相关者（如股东、管理层、员工、债权人等）之间的利益冲突如何影响公司决策和市场行为。  
  **English Explanation**: Conflict Theory is a sociological theory originally proposed by Karl Marx, which posits that society is driven by conflicts and struggles between different interest groups.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：在金融领域，冲突理论常用于分析公司治理问题，如管理层与股东之间的代理问题、股东与债权人之间的利益冲突等。例如，管理层可能为了自身利益而做出损害股东利益的决策，或者股东可能通过高杠杆策略损害债权人的利益。应用时需注意识别潜在的利益冲突及其对市场稳定性的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: In finance, Conflict Theory is often applied to analyze corporate governance issues, such as the agency problem between management and shareholders, or conflicts of interest between shareholders and creditors. For example, management might make decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of shareholders, or shareholders might pursue high-leverage strategies that harm creditors. When applying this theory, it is crucial to identify potential conflicts of interest and their impact on market stability.
