# Commingled Fund

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：混合基金（Commingled Fund）是指将多个投资者的资金汇集在一起，由专业投资经理统一管理和投资的基金。这种基金通常由机构投资者（如养老金、保险公司等）使用，目的是通过规模效应降低投资成本并提高投资效率。混合基金与共同基金类似，但通常不在公开市场上交易，且仅对特定投资者开放。  
  **English Explanation**: A commingled fund is a type of investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors, which is then managed collectively by a professional investment manager. These funds are typically used by institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, to achieve cost efficiencies and improved investment performance through economies of scale. Similar to mutual funds, commingled funds are not traded on public markets and are generally accessible only to specific investors.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：混合基金主要用于机构投资者的资产管理，如养老金计划、企业年金和保险资金的管理。由于资金规模较大，混合基金能够分散投资风险，并通过专业管理实现长期稳健收益。需要注意的是，混合基金的流动性较低，投资者通常需要长期持有，且退出机制相对复杂。  
  **English Application**: Commingled funds are primarily used for asset management by institutional investors, such as pension plans, corporate retirement funds, and insurance assets. Due to their large scale, these funds can diversify investment risks and achieve long-term stable returns through professional management. However, commingled funds typically have lower liquidity, requiring investors to hold their investments for extended periods, and exit mechanisms can be relatively complex.
