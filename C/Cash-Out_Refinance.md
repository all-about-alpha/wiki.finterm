* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：现金再融资（Cash-Out Refinance）是一种抵押贷款再融资方式，借款人通过将现有房产的抵押贷款替换为金额更大的新贷款，从而获得超出原贷款余额的现金。这部分现金可以用于其他用途，如房屋装修、债务整合或投资等。  
  **English Explanation**: A cash-out refinance is a type of mortgage refinancing where the borrower replaces their existing mortgage with a new loan that is larger than the current loan balance.
