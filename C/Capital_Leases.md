# Capital Leases

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资本租赁（Capital Leases）是一种租赁形式，承租人（租赁方）在租赁期间实质上获得了租赁资产的所有权和经济利益。根据会计准则，资本租赁要求承租人在资产负债表中将租赁资产确认为资产，并将未来租赁付款义务确认为负债。核心概念包括资产所有权转移、租赁期接近资产使用寿命、最低租赁付款现值接近资产公允价值等。  
  **English Explanation**: A capital lease is a lease agreement in which the lessee (the party leasing the asset) essentially obtains ownership and economic benefits of the leased asset during the lease term. According to accounting standards, a capital lease requires the lessee to recognize the leased asset as an asset on the balance sheet and the future lease payment obligations as liabilities. Key concepts include the transfer of asset ownership, the lease term approximating the asset's useful life, and the present value of minimum lease payments being close to the asset's fair value.

Therefore, businesses must carefully evaluate the financial implications when opting for capital leases.
