# Carried Interest

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Carried Interest（附带权益）是指私募股权基金或对冲基金的管理团队在基金投资获得收益后，按照事先约定的比例（通常为20%）从投资收益中提取的报酬。这部分收益通常是在基金达到一定回报率（即“优先回报率”或“门槛收益率”）后才会分配给管理团队。附带权益的核心概念在于将管理团队的利益与投资者的利益绑定，激励管理团队为基金创造更高的回报。  
  **English Explanation**: Carried Interest refers to the share of profits that the management team of a private equity or hedge fund receives from the fund's investment gains, typically at a pre-agreed rate (usually 20%). This share is distributed only after the fund achieves a certain rate of return (known as the "hurdle rate" or "preferred return"). The core concept of carried interest lies in aligning the interests of the management team with those of the investors, incentivizing the team to generate higher returns for the fund.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：附带权益广泛应用于私募股权基金、风险投资基金和对冲基金等领域。在这些场景中，管理团队通过附带权益获得报酬，前提是基金的投资回报超过约定的门槛收益率。需要注意的是，附带权益的分配可能涉及复杂的税务问题，尤其是在不同国家或地区的税法下，其税务处理方式可能有所不同。  
  **English Explanation**: Carried interest is widely used in private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds. In these scenarios, the management team earns compensation through carried interest, provided that the fund's returns exceed the agreed hurdle rate. It is important to note that the distribution of carried interest may involve complex tax issues, especially under the tax laws of different countries or regions, where its tax treatment may vary.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，附带权益具有重要意义。在监管层面，附带权益的税务处理一直是争议焦点，尤其是在是否应将其视为资本利得或普通收入的问题上。从投资角度看，附带权益是激励基金管理团队为投资者创造更高回报的关键机制。在行业层面，附带权益的分配方式直接影响基金的运作模式和团队的动力。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, carried interest holds significant importance. At the regulatory level, the tax treatment of carried interest has been a contentious issue, particularly regarding whether it should be classified as capital gains or ordinary income. From an investment standpoint, carried interest is a key mechanism for incentivizing fund managers to generate higher returns for investors. At the industry level, the distribution method of carried interest directly impacts the fund's operational model and the motivation of the management team.
