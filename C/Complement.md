# Complement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：在金融领域，“互补”（Complement）通常指两种或多种资产、产品或服务在功能或价值上相互补充，从而共同提升整体效益或降低风险。这一概念源于经济学中的“互补品”理论，由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）提出，强调某些商品或服务在消费或投资中的协同作用。  
  **English Explanation**: In finance, "Complement" refers to two or more assets, products, or services that mutually enhance each other's value or functionality, thereby improving overall efficiency or reducing risk. This concept originates from the economic theory of "complementary goods," introduced by economist Alfred Marshall, which emphasizes the synergistic effects of certain goods or services in consumption or investment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：在投资组合管理中，互补资产（如股票与债券）被用来分散风险并优化收益。例如，股票市场表现不佳时，债券市场可能表现较好，从而平衡整体投资组合的表现。此外，在金融产品设计中，互补性产品（如储蓄账户与保险）可以满足客户多样化的需求。需要注意的是，互补性并非绝对，市场环境变化可能导致互补关系失效。  
  **English Application**: In portfolio management, complementary assets (e.g., stocks and bonds) are used to diversify risk and optimize returns. For instance, when the stock market underperforms, the bond market may perform better, balancing the overall portfolio performance. Additionally, in financial product design, complementary products (e.g., savings accounts and insurance) can meet diverse customer needs. It is important to note that complementarity is not absolute, as changes in market conditions may disrupt complementary relationships.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，互补性资产有助于降低系统性风险；从投资角度看，互补性策略能提升投资组合的稳定性；从行业角度看，互补性产品设计有助于满足客户需求并增强市场竞争力。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, complementary assets help reduce systemic risk; from an investment perspective, complementary strategies enhance portfolio stability; and from an industry perspective, complementary product designs meet customer needs and strengthen market competitiveness.
