# Capitalize

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资本化（Capitalize）是指将某项支出或成本计入资产账户而非当期费用，从而在未来期间通过折旧或摊销的方式逐步分摊到损益表中的过程。这一概念源于会计学，核心在于区分资本性支出和收益性支出，确保财务报表的准确性和合理性。  
  **English Explanation**: Capitalize refers to the process of recording an expense or cost as an asset on the balance sheet rather than expensing it immediately in the income statement. This concept originates from accounting principles and focuses on distinguishing between capital expenditures and revenue expenditures to ensure the accuracy and rationality of financial statements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**：资本化常用于企业购置固定资产（如设备、建筑物）或研发支出等场景。例如，企业在开发新产品时，符合条件的研发成本可以资本化，并在未来几年内摊销。需要注意的是，过度资本化可能导致资产虚增，影响财务健康。  
  **English Application**: Capitalization is commonly used in scenarios such as the purchase of fixed assets (e.g., equipment, buildings) or research and development (R&D) expenses. For instance, a company developing a new product may capitalize eligible R&D costs and amortize them over several years. However, excessive capitalization can lead to inflated assets and negatively impact financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，资本化有助于规范企业财务行为，防止利润操纵；从投资角度看，合理的资本化能反映企业的长期投资价值；从行业角度看，资本化是衡量企业资产管理和财务稳健性的重要指标。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, capitalization helps standardize corporate financial practices and prevent profit manipulation. From an investment standpoint, appropriate capitalization reflects a company's long-term investment value. From an industry perspective, capitalization is a key metric for assessing asset management and financial stability.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：资本化的概念最早可追溯至19世纪的工业革命时期。随着大规模生产和固定资产投资的增加，企业需要一种方法将长期资产的成本合理分摊到多个会计期间。20世纪初，现代会计理论逐步形成，资本化成为会计准则的重要组成部分。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of capitalization dates back to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. With the rise of mass production and fixed asset investments, businesses needed a method to allocate the costs of long-term assets over multiple accounting periods. By the early 20th century, modern accounting theory had developed, and capitalization became a key component of accounting standards.
