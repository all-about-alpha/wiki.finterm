# Compound Interest

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：复利（Compound Interest）是指在计算利息时，将本金和之前累积的利息一起作为新的本金来计算下一期的利息。复利的概念最早由意大利数学家卢卡·帕乔利（Luca Pacioli）在1494年的著作《算术、几何、比与比例概要》中提出。复利的核心在于“利滚利”，即利息再生利息，从而实现资金的指数级增长。  
  **English Explanation**: Compound interest refers to the calculation of interest where the principal amount and the accumulated interest from previous periods are combined to calculate the interest for the next period. The concept of compound interest was first introduced by Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in his 1494 work "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita." The core idea of compound interest is "interest on interest," where interest is reinvested to generate exponential growth of capital.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：复利广泛应用于储蓄、投资和贷款等领域。例如，在银行存款中，复利可以帮助储户实现财富的长期增值；在投资中，复利效应可以显著提升长期投资的回报率；在贷款中，复利可能导致债务的快速累积。需要注意的是，复利虽然能带来收益，但也可能因高利率或长期负债而带来风险。  
  **English Application**: Compound interest is widely used in savings, investments, and loans. For example, in bank deposits, compound interest can help savers achieve long-term wealth growth; in investments, the compounding effect can significantly enhance long-term returns; in loans, compound interest can lead to rapid debt accumulation. It is important to note that while compound interest can generate returns, it may also pose risks due to high interest rates or long-term liabilities.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，复利是金融产品设计和定价的基础之一；从投资角度看，复利是长期投资的核心驱动力，能够帮助投资者实现财富的指数级增长；从行业角度看，复利效应推动了金融创新和理财产品的多样化发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, compound interest is one of the foundations of financial product design and pricing; from an investment perspective, it is the core driver of long-term investment, enabling exponential wealth growth; from an industry perspective, the compounding effect has spurred financial innovation and the diversification of wealth management products.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：复利的概念最早可追溯到古代文明，但系统化的理论是由意大利数学家卢卡·帕乔利在15世纪末提出的。他在1494年的著作中详细描述了复利的计算方法，并将其应用于商业和金融领域。此后，复利逐渐成为现代金融体系的重要组成部分。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of compound interest can be traced back to ancient civilizations, but its systematic theory was developed by Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in the late 15th century. In his 1494 work, he detailed the calculation methods of compound interest and applied it to commerce and finance. Since then, compound interest has become a fundamental component of the modern financial system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：复利的引入彻底改变了金融行业的运作方式。它不仅推动了储蓄和投资工具的创新，还促进了全球资本市场的繁荣。如今，复利效应被广泛应用于养老金计划、教育基金和长期投资策略中，成为个人和机构财富管理的重要工具。
