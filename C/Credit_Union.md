# Credit Union

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  信用合作社（Credit Union）是一种由会员共同拥有和管理的非营利性金融机构，旨在为会员提供储蓄、贷款和其他金融服务。其核心概念是“互助合作”，会员通过共同出资形成资金池，并以较低的利率向会员提供贷款，同时将盈余返还给会员。信用合作社通常由特定社区、行业或组织成员组成，强调服务会员而非追求利润最大化。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A credit union is a member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperative that provides savings, loans, and other financial services to its members. The core concept is "mutual cooperation," where members pool their resources to create a fund, offering loans at lower interest rates and returning profits to members. Credit unions are typically formed by specific communities, industries, or organizations, focusing on serving members rather than maximizing profits.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  信用合作社广泛应用于社区、学校、企业等特定群体中，为会员提供低息贷款、储蓄账户、信用卡等服务。由于其非营利性质，信用合作社的贷款利率通常低于商业银行，适合有稳定收入但难以获得传统银行贷款的个人或小微企业。需要注意的是，信用合作社的服务范围通常限于会员，且规模较小，可能存在流动性风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Credit unions are widely used in specific groups such as communities, schools, and businesses, offering services like low-interest loans, savings accounts, and credit cards. Due to their non-profit nature, credit unions often provide lower loan rates than commercial banks, making them suitable for individuals or small businesses with stable incomes but limited access to traditional bank loans. It’s important to note that credit unions typically serve only their members and may face liquidity risks due to their smaller scale.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，信用合作社是金融体系的重要组成部分，尤其在服务中小企业和低收入群体方面具有独特优势。从投资角度看，信用合作社的稳健运营和低风险特性使其成为保守型投资者的选择。从行业角度看，信用合作社推动了金融普惠，弥补了传统银行服务的不足。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, credit unions are a vital part of the financial system, particularly in serving small businesses and low-income groups. From an investment standpoint, their stable operations and low-risk nature make them attractive to conservative investors. From an industry perspective, credit unions promote financial inclusion and address gaps in traditional banking services.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **中文起源**  
  信用合作社的起源可以追溯到19世纪中叶的欧洲，特别是德国。1849年，德国经济学家赫尔曼·舒尔茨-德利奇（Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch）和弗里德里希·威廉·赖夫艾森（Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen）分别创立了早期的信用合作社模式，旨在帮助农民和小手工业者获得低成本贷款。20世纪初，这一模式传入美国，并逐渐发展成为现代信用合作社体系。  
  **English Origin**  
  The origin of credit unions dates back to mid-19th century Europe, particularly Germany. In 1849, German economists Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch and Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen established early credit union models to help farmers and small artisans access low-cost loans.
