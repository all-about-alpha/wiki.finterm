# Contrarian

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  逆向投资者（Contrarian）是指那些在市场普遍看涨时选择卖出，或在市场普遍看跌时选择买入的投资者。这种投资策略的核心在于“逆势而行”，即与市场主流情绪相反。逆向投资者通常认为市场情绪会导致资产价格偏离其内在价值，从而通过反向操作获取超额收益。这一概念最早由投资大师大卫·德雷曼（David Dreman）和约翰·邓普顿（John Templeton）等人提出并推广。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A contrarian is an investor who chooses to sell when the market is generally bullish or to buy when the market is generally bearish. The core of this investment strategy lies in "going against the trend," meaning acting contrary to prevailing market sentiment. Contrarian investors typically believe that market sentiment can cause asset prices to deviate from their intrinsic value, thereby achieving excess returns through reverse operations. This concept was first introduced and popularized by investment gurus such as David Dreman and John Templeton.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  逆向投资策略常用于股票市场、外汇市场和大宗商品市场。例如，在市场恐慌性抛售时，逆向投资者可能会买入被低估的股票，等待市场情绪恢复后获利。然而，这种策略需要投资者具备较强的心理承受能力和深入的市场分析能力，因为逆势操作可能面临短期亏损的风险。  
  **English Application**  
  Contrarian investment strategies are commonly used in stock markets, foreign exchange markets, and commodity markets. For instance, during a market panic sell-off, contrarian investors might buy undervalued stocks, waiting to profit when market sentiment recovers. However, this strategy requires investors to have strong psychological resilience and in-depth market analysis skills, as going against the trend may entail short-term losses.

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, contrarian investing helps rationalize market prices and reduce market bubbles. From an investment standpoint, it offers investors an opportunity to achieve excess returns under extreme market conditions.
