## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：信用冻结的概念最早起源于美国，旨在应对日益严重的身份盗窃问题。2003年，加利福尼亚州率先通过立法，允许消费者冻结其信用报告。随后，其他州纷纷效仿。2007年，美国联邦政府通过《公平信用报告法》（FCRA）修正案，将信用冻结的权利推广至全国。2018年，《经济成长、监管救济和消费者保护法案》进一步简化了信用冻结和解冻的流程，使其更加便捷。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of credit freezes originated in the United States as a response to the growing problem of identity theft. In 2003, California became the first state to pass legislation allowing consumers to freeze their credit reports. Other states soon followed suit. In 2007, the U.S. federal government passed an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), extending the right to freeze credit reports nationwide. In 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act further simplified the process of freezing and unfreezing credit reports, making it more convenient.
