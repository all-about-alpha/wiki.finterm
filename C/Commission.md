## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：佣金的起源可以追溯到古代贸易中的中间人角色。在15世纪的欧洲，随着海上贸易的兴起，商人开始雇佣代理人处理远距离交易，代理人从中收取一定比例的费用作为报酬。这一模式逐渐演变为现代佣金制度。在中国，明清时期的“牙行”也是佣金制度的早期形式，牙行作为中间商促成买卖并收取佣金。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of commission dates back to the role of middlemen in ancient trade. In 15th-century Europe, with the rise of maritime trade, merchants began hiring agents to handle long-distance transactions, and these agents charged a percentage fee as compensation. This model gradually evolved into the modern commission system. In China, the "Yahang" (brokerage firms) during the Ming and Qing dynasties were an early form of the commission system, where brokers facilitated transactions and charged fees.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：佣金制度对金融行业的发展产生了深远影响。它促进了证券经纪、保险代理等行业的专业化，同时也推动了金融市场的流动性。然而，高佣金可能引发道德风险，例如中介为赚取更多佣金而推荐不适合客户的产品。因此，现代金融监管越来越强调佣金的透明化和合理化。  
  **English Impact**: The commission system has had a profound impact on the development of the financial industry. It has promoted the specialization of sectors such as securities brokerage and insurance agency, while also enhancing market liquidity. However, high commissions can lead to moral hazards, such as intermediaries recommending unsuitable products to clients to earn more fees. As a result, modern financial regulation increasingly emphasizes the transparency and fairness of commissions.
