# Combined Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：综合比率（Combined Ratio）是保险业中用于衡量保险公司承保业务盈利能力的关键指标。它由赔付率（Loss Ratio）和费用率（Expense Ratio）相加而成，计算公式为：综合比率 = 赔付率 + 费用率。赔付率反映保险公司支付的赔款与保费收入的比例，费用率则反映保险公司运营费用与保费收入的比例。综合比率低于100%表示承保业务盈利，高于100%则表示承保业务亏损。  
  **English Explanation**: The Combined Ratio is a key metric in the insurance industry used to measure the profitability of an insurer's underwriting business. It is calculated by adding the Loss Ratio and the Expense Ratio: Combined Ratio = Loss Ratio + Expense Ratio. The Loss Ratio reflects the proportion of claims paid by the insurer relative to premium income, while the Expense Ratio reflects the proportion of operating expenses relative to premium income. A Combined Ratio below 100% indicates underwriting profitability, while a ratio above 100% indicates underwriting losses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：综合比率广泛应用于保险公司的财务分析和业绩评估中。投资者、监管机构和保险公司管理层通过该指标评估公司的承保效率和风险管理能力。例如，在车险、健康险和财产险等领域，综合比率是衡量业务健康程度的重要工具。需要注意的是，综合比率未考虑投资收益，因此需结合其他财务指标（如投资收益率）进行综合分析。  
  **English Explanation**: The Combined Ratio is widely used in financial analysis and performance evaluation of insurance companies. Investors, regulators, and company management use this metric to assess underwriting efficiency and risk management capabilities. For example, in auto insurance, health insurance, and property insurance, the Combined Ratio is a crucial tool for evaluating business health. It is important to note that the Combined Ratio does not account for investment income, so it should be analyzed alongside other financial metrics (e.g., investment return rate) for a comprehensive assessment.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：综合比率在保险行业中具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它是评估保险公司偿付能力和财务稳定性的重要指标；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者判断保险公司的盈利潜力和风险水平；从行业角度看，它是衡量保险公司竞争力和运营效率的核心工具。低综合比率通常意味着公司具有较强的承保能力和成本控制能力。  
  **English Explanation**: The Combined Ratio holds significant importance in the insurance industry. From a regulatory perspective, it is a key metric for assessing an insurer's solvency and financial stability. From an investment perspective, it helps investors evaluate the profitability potential and risk level of an insurance company. From an industry perspective, it is a core tool for measuring an insurer's competitiveness and operational efficiency. A low Combined Ratio typically indicates strong underwriting capabilities and cost control.
