## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    《社区再投资法》（Community Reinvestment Act, CRA）是美国于1977年通过的一项联邦法律，旨在鼓励金融机构满足其所在社区（尤其是中低收入社区）的信贷需求，防止“红线歧视”（redlining）现象。该法案要求银行和其他存款机构在其服务区域内提供公平的金融服务，包括贷款、投资和服务，以促进社区的经济发展。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a federal law enacted in the United States in 1977, designed to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, particularly low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The act aims to prevent redlining and requires banks and other depository institutions to provide fair financial services, including loans, investments, and services, to promote economic development in their service areas.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    CRA主要应用于美国的银行和存款机构，要求它们在评估其服务社区的信贷需求时，必须考虑中低收入群体的需求。银行需定期提交CRA绩效报告，监管机构会根据其表现进行评级。应用场景包括住房贷款、小企业贷款、社区发展项目等。需要注意的是，CRA并不强制要求银行提供高风险贷款，而是鼓励公平和合理的信贷分配。  
  - **English Application**  
    The CRA primarily applies to U.S. banks and depository institutions, requiring them to consider the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities when assessing their service areas. Banks must periodically submit CRA performance reports, and regulators rate their performance based on these reports. Application scenarios include housing loans, small business loans, and community development projects. It is important to note that the CRA does not mandate high-risk lending but encourages fair and reasonable credit distribution.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    CRA的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代，当时美国城市中普遍存在“红线歧视”现象，即银行拒绝向某些社区（通常是少数族裔或低收入社区）提供贷款。这种现象导致这些社区的经济状况进一步恶化。1977年，美国国会通过了CRA，旨在纠正这一不公平的信贷分配现象。法案的推动者包括民权活动家和社区组织，他们通过游说和倡导促成了这一立法。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The origin of the CRA dates back to the 1970s when redlining—a practice where banks refused to provide loans to certain neighborhoods, often minority or low-income communities—was widespread in U.S. cities. This practice exacerbated the economic decline of these areas. In 1977, the U.S. Congress passed the CRA to address this inequitable credit distribution. The legislation was championed by civil rights activists and community organizations through lobbying and advocacy efforts.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**  
    CRA的实施对美国金融行业产生了深远影响。它促使银行更加关注中低收入社区的信贷需求，推动了社区发展项目的融资。然而，CRA也引发了一些争议，例如是否会导致银行承担过高的风险。尽管如此，CRA仍然是美国金融体系中促进社会公平的重要工具。目前，CRA的监管框架仍在不断调整，以适应金融行业的变化。  
  - **English Impact**  
    The implementation of the CRA has had a profound impact on the U.S. financial industry. It has encouraged banks to pay more attention to the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities, facilitating funding for community development projects. However, the CRA has also sparked debates, such as whether it forces banks to take on excessive risks. Despite this, the CRA remains a vital tool for promoting social equity within the U.S. financial system. Currently, the regulatory framework of the CRA continues to evolve to adapt to changes in the financial industry.
