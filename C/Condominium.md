    公寓（Condominium，简称Condo）是一种房地产所有权形式，指多个业主共同拥有一栋建筑，但每个业主独立拥有其特定单元的所有权。公共区域（如走廊、电梯、健身房等）则由所有业主共同拥有和管理。这种形式起源于20世纪中期的美国，旨在解决城市住房需求与土地资源有限之间的矛盾。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    A condominium (often abbreviated as condo) is a form of real estate ownership where multiple owners jointly own a building, but each owner independently owns their specific unit. Common areas (such as hallways, elevators, gyms, etc.) are collectively owned and managed by all the owners. This form originated in the mid-20th century in the United States to address the conflict between urban housing demand and limited land resources.
