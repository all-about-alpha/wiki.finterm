# Credit Limit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：信用额度（Credit Limit）是指金融机构（如银行或信用卡公司）根据客户的信用状况和还款能力，为其设定的最高借款或消费限额。这一概念最早由银行和信用卡公司引入，旨在控制风险并确保客户在可承受的范围内使用信用。核心概念包括信用评估、风险管理和客户还款能力。  
  **English Explanation**: A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit that a financial institution (such as a bank or credit card company) extends to a client based on their creditworthiness and repayment capacity. This concept was introduced by banks and credit card companies to manage risk and ensure that clients use credit within manageable bounds. Key concepts include credit assessment, risk management, and repayment capacity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：信用额度广泛应用于信用卡、个人贷款和商业信贷等领域。例如，信用卡持卡人可以在信用额度内进行消费，但超出额度将无法继续使用。金融机构会根据客户的收入、信用记录和负债情况动态调整额度。需要注意的是，过度使用信用额度可能导致债务累积和信用评分下降。  
  **English Explanation**: Credit limits are widely used in credit cards, personal loans, and commercial credit. For example, a credit cardholder can spend within their credit limit, but transactions exceeding the limit will be declined. Financial institutions dynamically adjust limits based on factors such as income, credit history, and debt levels. It is important to note that excessive use of credit limits can lead to debt accumulation and a decline in credit scores.

  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, credit limits are a crucial tool for financial institutions to control risk and prevent over-borrowing and systemic financial risks. From an investor's perspective, credit limits reflect a client's creditworthiness and are an important indicator of their repayment capacity.
