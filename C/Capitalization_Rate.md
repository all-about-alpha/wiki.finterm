# Capitalization Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资本化率（Capitalization Rate），简称“Cap Rate”，是房地产投资中用于评估物业价值的重要指标。它表示物业的年净营业收入（NOI）与其市场价值或购买价格的比率。资本化率越高，通常意味着投资回报率越高，但风险也可能更大。  
  **English Explanation**: The Capitalization Rate, often abbreviated as "Cap Rate," is a key metric in real estate investment used to evaluate the value of a property. It represents the ratio of a property's annual Net Operating Income (NOI) to its market value or purchase price. A higher Cap Rate generally indicates a higher return on investment, but it may also imply greater risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：资本化率广泛应用于房地产投资决策中，帮助投资者比较不同物业的潜在回报。例如，投资者可以通过比较两个物业的资本化率来决定哪个更具投资价值。需要注意的是，资本化率不考虑融资成本和未来收入增长，因此在实际应用中需结合其他财务指标综合分析。  
  **English Explanation**: The Cap Rate is widely used in real estate investment decisions to help investors compare the potential returns of different properties. For instance, an investor might compare the Cap Rates of two properties to determine which one offers better investment value. It is important to note that the Cap Rate does not account for financing costs or future income growth, so it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics for a comprehensive analysis.

  **中文解释**：资本化率在房地产投资中具有重要意义。从监管角度看，它帮助评估物业的市场价值；从投资角度看，它是衡量投资回报的关键指标；从行业角度看，资本化率反映了市场供需关系和风险水平。  
  **English Explanation**: The Cap Rate holds significant importance in real estate investment. From a regulatory perspective, it helps assess the market value of properties. From an investment standpoint, it is a crucial metric for measuring returns. From an industry perspective, the Cap Rate reflects market supply-demand dynamics and risk levels.
