## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  - **中文起源**：过度交易的概念最早可追溯到20世纪初美国证券市场的快速发展时期。随着证券经纪行业的兴起，部分经纪人为了追求高额佣金，开始滥用客户账户进行频繁交易。1929年股市崩盘后，美国国会通过《1934年证券交易法》，明确禁止过度交易行为。  
  - **English Origin**: The concept of churning dates back to the early 20th century during the rapid growth of the U.S. securities market. As the brokerage industry expanded, some brokers began excessively trading client accounts to earn higher commissions.

  - **English Impact**: Churning has had a profound impact on the securities industry, prompting stricter financial regulations worldwide.
