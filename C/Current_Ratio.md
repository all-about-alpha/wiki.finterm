# Current Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：流动比率（Current Ratio）是衡量企业短期偿债能力的财务指标，计算公式为流动资产除以流动负债。它反映了企业在短期内用流动资产偿还流动负债的能力。该指标由美国财务分析师亚历山大·沃尔（Alexander Wall）在20世纪初提出，是财务分析中常用的流动性指标之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The Current Ratio is a financial metric used to assess a company's short-term liquidity, calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. It indicates the company's ability to cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. This metric was introduced by American financial analyst Alexander Wall in the early 20th century and is one of the most commonly used liquidity measures in financial analysis.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：流动比率广泛应用于企业财务分析中，特别是在评估企业的短期偿债能力时。一般来说，流动比率大于1表示企业有足够的流动资产来覆盖流动负债，而低于1则可能意味着企业面临短期偿债压力。然而，过高的流动比率也可能表明企业资产利用效率低下。投资者、债权人和管理层常用这一指标来评估企业的财务健康状况。  
  **English Explanation**: The Current Ratio is widely used in corporate financial analysis, particularly for evaluating short-term solvency. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that a company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, while a ratio below 1 may suggest potential short-term liquidity issues. However, an excessively high ratio might indicate inefficient use of assets. Investors, creditors, and management often use this metric to assess a company's financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，流动比率是评估企业财务稳健性的重要工具。监管机构通过这一指标监控企业的偿债能力，投资者则用它来判断企业的短期风险，而企业管理层则依赖它来优化资产和负债结构。流动比率的高低直接影响企业的信用评级和融资成本。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Current Ratio is a crucial tool for assessing a company's financial stability. Regulators use it to monitor solvency, investors rely on it to gauge short-term risks, and management depends on it to optimize asset and liability structures. The level of the Current Ratio directly impacts a company's credit rating and financing costs.
