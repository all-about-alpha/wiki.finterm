## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  **中文解释**：信用事件（Credit Event）是指在金融衍生品市场中，特别是信用违约互换（CDS）合约中，触发合约赔付的特定事件。这些事件通常包括债务人破产、未能按时支付债务、债务重组或债务违约等。信用事件是信用衍生品市场中的核心概念，用于衡量和转移信用风险。  
  **English Explanation**: A Credit Event refers to a specific occurrence in the financial derivatives market, particularly in Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts, that triggers a payout under the contract.

* **应用 / Application**

  **English Explanation**: Credit Events are primarily used in financial derivatives such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to hedge or speculate on credit risk. For example, an investor might purchase a CDS to hedge against the risk of default on a bond they hold. When a Credit Event occurs, the seller of the CDS is obligated to pay the buyer. It is important to note that the criteria for determining a Credit Event may vary depending on the contract terms, and investors should carefully review these terms to avoid disputes.
