# Conventional Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  常规抵押贷款（Conventional Mortgage）是指不通过政府机构（如美国联邦住房管理局FHA或退伍军人事务部VA）担保或保险的住房贷款。这类贷款通常由私人金融机构（如银行或抵押贷款公司）提供，并遵循房利美（Fannie Mae）和房地美（Freddie Mac）等政府支持企业的贷款标准。常规抵押贷款通常要求借款人支付较高的首付款（通常为房价的20%），以避免私人抵押保险（PMI）。  

  **English Explanation**：  
  A Conventional Mortgage is a home loan that is not insured or guaranteed by a government agency (such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)). These loans are typically offered by private financial institutions (such as banks or mortgage companies) and adhere to the lending standards set by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Conventional Mortgages often require a higher down payment (typically 20% of the home price) to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).
