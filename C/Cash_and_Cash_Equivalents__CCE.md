# Cash and Cash Equivalents (CCE)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  现金及现金等价物（CCE）是指企业持有的、可以随时用于支付的现金以及具有高度流动性的短期投资。现金包括库存现金、银行存款等，而现金等价物通常指期限短（一般不超过三个月）、流动性强、易于转换为已知金额现金且价值变动风险很小的投资，如国库券、商业票据等。这一概念由国际会计准则理事会（IASB）和美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）共同定义，是企业财务报表中的重要组成部分。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents (CCE) refer to the cash held by a company that is readily available for use, as well as short-term investments that are highly liquid. Cash includes physical currency, bank deposits, and similar assets, while cash equivalents typically consist of short-term investments (usually with maturities of three months or less) that are easily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to minimal risk of value fluctuation, such as treasury bills and commercial paper. This concept is defined by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and is a critical component of a company's financial statements.  

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  现金及现金等价物广泛应用于企业的日常运营和财务管理中。例如，企业利用现金及现金等价物支付供应商货款、员工工资以及应对突发资金需求。在财务报表中，现金及现金等价物是衡量企业短期偿债能力和流动性的重要指标。需要注意的是，现金等价物的选择需符合会计准则，避免将高风险或长期投资错误归类为现金等价物。  

  **English Application**  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents are widely used in a company's daily operations and financial management. For instance, companies utilize CCE to pay suppliers, employee salaries, and address unexpected funding needs. In financial statements, CCE is a key metric for assessing a company's short-term solvency and liquidity. It is important to note that the selection of cash equivalents must comply with accounting standards to avoid misclassifying high-risk or long-term investments as cash equivalents.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  现金及现金等价物的概念起源于20世纪初的会计实践。随着企业规模的扩大和金融工具的多样化，会计准则制定机构逐渐意识到需要明确区分现金与其他流动资产。1973年，国际会计准则委员会（IASC，现为IASB）首次在《国际会计准则第7号——现金流量表》中正式定义了现金及现金等价物。此后，这一概念被全球广泛采纳并不断完善。  

  **English Origin**  
  The concept of Cash and Cash Equivalents originated in early 20th-century accounting practices. As companies grew in size and financial instruments diversified, accounting standard-setting bodies recognized the need to clearly distinguish cash from other liquid assets. In 1973, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC, now IASB) formally defined CCE in International Accounting Standard 7 (IAS 7) – Statement of Cash Flows. Since then, the concept has been widely adopted and refined globally.
