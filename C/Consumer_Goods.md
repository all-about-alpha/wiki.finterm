## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：消费品（Consumer Goods）是指为满足个人或家庭日常需求而购买和使用的商品。这些商品通常分为耐用消费品（如家电、汽车）和非耐用消费品（如食品、衣物）。消费品是经济活动中最直接与消费者接触的部分，其生产和销售反映了市场需求和消费趋势。  
  **English Explanation**: Consumer goods are products purchased and used by individuals or households to meet daily needs. These goods are typically categorized into durable goods (e.g., appliances, cars) and non-durable goods (e.g., food, clothing). Consumer goods represent the most direct interaction between the economy and consumers, with their production and sales reflecting market demand and consumption trends.
