## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  竞争是指在市场经济中，多个经济主体为了争夺有限的资源、市场份额或客户而进行的对抗性行为。竞争的核心概念包括市场参与者、资源稀缺性、价格机制以及优胜劣汰。这一概念最早由经济学家亚当·斯密在《国富论》中提出，强调竞争是市场经济的核心驱动力。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Competition refers to the adversarial behavior among multiple economic entities in a market economy, striving to secure limited resources, market share, or customers. Core concepts include market participants, resource scarcity, price mechanisms, and survival of the fittest. This concept was first articulated by economist Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations*, emphasizing competition as the driving force of a market economy.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  竞争广泛应用于商业、金融、科技等领域。例如，企业通过价格战、产品创新或营销策略争夺市场份额；投资者通过分析市场竞争格局评估企业价值。需要注意的是，过度竞争可能导致资源浪费或市场垄断，因此需在监管框架下进行。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Competition is widely applied in business, finance, technology, and other fields. For instance, companies compete for market share through price wars, product innovation, or marketing strategies; investors assess company value by analyzing market competition. However, excessive competition may lead to resource waste or market monopolization, necessitating regulation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**  
  从监管角度看，竞争是维护市场公平和效率的关键；从投资角度看，竞争格局直接影响企业盈利能力和估值；从行业角度看，竞争推动技术创新和产业升级。因此，竞争被视为市场经济的基石。  
  **English Explanation**  
  From a regulatory perspective, competition is crucial for maintaining market fairness and efficiency; from an investment perspective, competitive dynamics directly impact corporate profitability and valuation; from an industry perspective, competition drives technological innovation and industrial upgrading. Thus, competition is regarded as the cornerstone of a market economy.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**  
  竞争的概念可追溯至古希腊时期，但现代经济学意义上的竞争理论由18世纪的亚当·斯密系统化。他在《国富论》中提出“看不见的手”理论，认为市场竞争能自发调节资源配置。19世纪末，马歇尔等经济学家进一步完善了竞争理论，将其与供需关系结合。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The concept of competition dates back to ancient Greece, but modern economic theories were systematized by Adam Smith in the 18th century. In *The Wealth of Nations*, he introduced the "invisible hand" theory, arguing that market competition spontaneously regulates resource allocation. By the late 19th century, economists like Alfred Marshall further refined competition theory, integrating it with supply and demand dynamics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**  
  竞争对全球经济发展产生了深远影响。例如，20世纪80年代的自由化浪潮推动了全球市场竞争，促进了国际贸易和投资。如今，数字化和全球化加剧了竞争，但也带来了新的挑战，如数据垄断和跨境监管难题。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Competition has profoundly impacted global economic development. For example, the liberalization wave of the 1980s spurred global market competition, boosting international trade and investment. Today, digitization and globalization have intensified competition but also introduced new challenges, such as data monopolies and cross-border regulatory issues.
