  **English Explanation**：  
  A contingency refers to a potential liability or asset that a company may face in the future, depending on the outcome of uncertain events. These events are often related to legal disputes, tax controversies, or guarantee obligations, and their final outcome can only be determined when a specific future event occurs or does not occur.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  或有事项的概念最早可以追溯到20世纪初的会计理论发展。随着企业规模的扩大和全球化进程的加速，企业面临的不确定性事件逐渐增多，或有事项的会计处理逐渐成为财务报告中的重要议题。1975年，美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）发布了《财务会计准则第5号》（FAS 5），首次系统性地规范了或有事项的会计处理。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of contingencies can be traced back to the early 20th century with the development of accounting theory. As companies grew in size and globalization accelerated, the number of uncertain events faced by businesses increased, making the accounting treatment of contingencies a critical issue in financial reporting. In 1975, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (FAS 5), which systematically standardized the accounting treatment of contingencies for the first time.

  或有事项的规范对全球财务报告体系产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了财务报表的透明度和可比性，还促使企业更加谨慎地评估和管理潜在风险。在中国，随着资本市场的不断发展，或有事项的披露要求也逐步与国际接轨，成为企业财务报告中的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**：  
  The standardization of contingencies has had a profound impact on global financial reporting systems. It has not only enhanced the transparency and comparability of financial statements but also encouraged companies to more carefully assess and manage potential risks.
