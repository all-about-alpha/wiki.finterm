# Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  现金持有套利（Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage）是一种金融套利策略，投资者通过同时买入现货资产并卖出相应期货合约，利用现货与期货价格之间的差异获取无风险利润。该策略的核心在于现货价格与期货价格之间的基差（Basis），当基差大于持有成本（如仓储费、利息等）时，套利机会出现。这一策略最早由期货市场的套利者提出，广泛应用于商品、金融资产等领域。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage is a financial arbitrage strategy where an investor simultaneously buys a spot asset and sells the corresponding futures contract to profit from the price difference between the spot and futures markets. The core of this strategy lies in the basis (the difference between the spot price and the futures price). When the basis exceeds the cost of carry (such as storage fees, interest, etc.), an arbitrage opportunity arises. This strategy was initially proposed by arbitrageurs in the futures market and is widely applied in commodities, financial assets, and other fields.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  现金持有套利常用于商品市场（如黄金、原油）和金融市场（如股票、债券）。例如，当黄金现货价格低于期货价格时，投资者可以买入现货黄金并卖出期货合约，锁定利润。需要注意的是，该策略依赖于市场价格的准确性、流动性以及持有成本的计算，同时需防范市场波动、政策变化等风险。  

  **English Application**  
  Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage is commonly used in commodity markets (e.g., gold, crude oil) and financial markets (e.g., stocks, bonds). For instance, when the spot price of gold is lower than the futures price, an investor can buy spot gold and sell futures contracts to lock in profits. It is important to note that this strategy relies on accurate market pricing, liquidity, and precise calculation of carrying costs. Risks such as market volatility and regulatory changes must also be managed.
