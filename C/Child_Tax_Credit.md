# Child Tax Credit

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  儿童税收抵免（Child Tax Credit）是一种由政府提供的税收优惠政策，旨在减轻有子女家庭的税务负担。该政策允许符合条件的纳税人在申报所得税时，按每个符合条件的子女扣除一定金额的税款。核心概念包括“子女资格”、“抵免额度”和“收入限制”。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The Child Tax Credit is a tax benefit provided by the government to reduce the tax burden on families with children. It allows eligible taxpayers to deduct a certain amount of tax for each qualifying child when filing their income tax returns. Key concepts include "child eligibility," "credit amount," and "income limits."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  儿童税收抵免适用于有未成年子女的家庭，尤其是中低收入家庭。纳税人需满足一定的收入条件，并且子女需符合年龄、居住和抚养关系等要求。需要注意的是，抵免额度可能因政策调整而变化，且部分抵免可能可退还（Refundable Credit），即使纳税人无需缴税，也可能获得退款。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  The Child Tax Credit applies to families with dependent children, particularly middle- and low-income households. Taxpayers must meet specific income criteria, and the children must satisfy age, residency, and dependency requirements. It is important to note that the credit amount may vary due to policy changes, and some portions may be refundable, meaning taxpayers could receive a refund even if they owe no tax.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，儿童税收抵免是政府支持家庭福利的重要工具，有助于缓解贫困和促进社会公平。从投资和行业角度看，该政策间接提升了家庭消费能力，对经济增长有积极影响。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, the Child Tax Credit is a vital tool for supporting family welfare, helping to alleviate poverty and promote social equity.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  儿童税收抵免最早于1997年在美国《纳税人减税法案》（Taxpayer Relief Act）中引入，初始额度为每个子女500美元。此后，该政策经过多次调整，例如2001年《经济增长与税收减免协调法案》（Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act）将额度提高至1000美元，2021年《美国救援计划法案》（American Rescue Plan Act）进一步扩大抵免额度和覆盖范围。  
  **English Origin**  
  The Child Tax Credit was first introduced in the United States under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, with an initial credit of $500 per child. It has undergone several adjustments since then, such as the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which increased the credit to $1,000 per child, and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which further expanded the credit amount and eligibility.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  儿童税收抵免政策显著改善了低收入家庭的经济状况，减少了儿童贫困率。例如，2021年政策调整后，美国儿童贫困率降至历史低点。目前，该政策在全球多个国家得到应用，成为家庭福利体系的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**  
  The Child Tax Credit has significantly improved the financial situation of low-income families and reduced child poverty rates.
