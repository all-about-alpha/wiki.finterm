# Cost Averaging

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  成本平均法（Cost Averaging），又称“定期定额投资法”，是一种投资策略，指投资者在固定的时间间隔内，以固定的金额购买某种投资产品（如股票、基金等），无论市场价格高低。这种方法的核心是通过分散投资时间点，降低市场波动带来的风险，从而平滑投资成本。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Cost averaging, also known as "dollar-cost averaging," is an investment strategy where an investor regularly invests a fixed amount of money into a particular investment (such as stocks or mutual funds) at fixed intervals, regardless of the market price. The core concept is to reduce the impact of market volatility by spreading out investment over time, thereby smoothing the average cost of investment.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  成本平均法常用于长期投资，尤其适合波动性较大的市场（如股票市场）。投资者无需预测市场高低点，只需坚持定期投入，从而避免因一次性投入而可能面临的短期市场波动风险。需要注意的是，这种方法在长期上涨的市场中可能收益较低，因为平均成本会逐渐上升。  
  **English Application**  
  Cost averaging is commonly used in long-term investments, particularly in volatile markets like the stock market. Investors do not need to predict market highs or lows but instead consistently invest fixed amounts over time, reducing the risk of short-term market fluctuations. However, in a consistently rising market, this method may yield lower returns as the average cost increases over time.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从投资角度看，成本平均法是一种简单有效的风险管理工具，特别适合普通投资者。它帮助投资者避免情绪化决策，培养纪律性投资习惯。从行业角度看，这种方法被广泛推广，尤其是在基金和养老金管理中，因其能够降低市场波动对投资组合的冲击。  
  **English Significance**  
  From an investment perspective, cost averaging is a simple yet effective risk management tool, particularly suitable for retail investors. It helps investors avoid emotional decision-making and fosters disciplined investment habits. From an industry perspective, this method is widely promoted, especially in mutual funds and pension management, as it mitigates the impact of market volatility on investment portfolios.
