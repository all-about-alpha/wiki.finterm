# Capital Loss Carryover

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：资本损失结转（Capital Loss Carryover）是指投资者在某一纳税年度内未能完全抵扣的资本损失，可以结转到未来纳税年度，用于抵扣未来的资本收益。这一机制旨在减轻投资者因市场波动导致的资本损失带来的税务负担。核心概念包括资本损失、税务抵扣和结转机制。  
  **English Explanation**: Capital Loss Carryover refers to the ability of investors to carry forward capital losses that cannot be fully deducted in the current tax year to future tax years, where they can be used to offset future capital gains. This mechanism is designed to alleviate the tax burden on investors caused by market fluctuations. Key concepts include capital losses, tax deductions, and carryover mechanisms.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：资本损失结转主要应用于个人和企业的税务规划中。例如，当投资者在某一年度因股票投资亏损而无法完全抵扣资本收益时，可以将未抵扣的损失结转到未来年度，用于抵扣未来的资本收益。需要注意的是，结转的资本损失通常有年限限制，且不能用于抵扣普通收入。  
  **English Application**: Capital Loss Carryover is primarily used in tax planning for individuals and businesses. For instance, if an investor incurs a capital loss from stock investments in a given year that cannot be fully offset against capital gains, the unused loss can be carried forward to future years to offset future capital gains. It is important to note that carried-over capital losses are typically subject to time limits and cannot be used to offset ordinary income.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，资本损失结转机制有助于平滑投资者的税务负担，避免因市场波动导致的税务不公平。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更大的灵活性，鼓励长期投资。从行业角度看，这一机制有助于稳定资本市场，减少短期投机行为。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the Capital Loss Carryover mechanism helps smooth out the tax burden on investors, preventing tax inequities caused by market volatility. From an investment perspective, it provides greater flexibility for investors, encouraging long-term investment. From an industry perspective, this mechanism helps stabilize capital markets and reduce short-term speculative behavior.
