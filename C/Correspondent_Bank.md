# Correspondent Bank

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：代理行（Correspondent Bank）是指一家银行为另一家银行提供金融服务，通常是在不同国家或地区之间进行跨境交易时使用。代理行充当中间人，帮助客户银行完成支付、清算、外汇交易等业务。核心概念包括跨境金融服务、代理关系以及资金清算。  
  **English Explanation**: A correspondent bank is a financial institution that provides services on behalf of another bank, typically facilitating cross-border transactions between different countries or regions. It acts as an intermediary, assisting the client bank in completing payments, clearing, foreign exchange transactions, and other financial services. Key concepts include cross-border financial services, correspondent relationships, and fund clearing.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：代理行广泛应用于国际贸易、跨境支付和外汇交易中。例如，当中国的一家银行需要向美国的客户支付款项时，可能会通过一家在美国的代理行来完成资金的清算和转账。需要注意的是，代理行关系可能涉及较高的手续费和潜在的合规风险，特别是在反洗钱（AML）和反恐融资（CFT）方面。  
  **English Application**: Correspondent banks are widely used in international trade, cross-border payments, and foreign exchange transactions. For example, when a bank in China needs to make a payment to a client in the United States, it may use a correspondent bank in the U.S. to facilitate the clearing and transfer of funds. It is important to note that correspondent banking relationships may involve higher fees and potential compliance risks, particularly in areas such as anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT).

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度来看，代理行在跨境资金流动中扮演着关键角色，确保资金的安全和合规性。从投资和行业角度来看，代理行关系有助于促进国际贸易和金融市场的全球化，但也需要加强监管以防范金融犯罪。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, correspondent banks play a crucial role in facilitating cross-border fund flows, ensuring the security and compliance of transactions. From an investment and industry standpoint, correspondent banking relationships help promote international trade and the globalization of financial markets, but they also require enhanced oversight to prevent financial crimes.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context
