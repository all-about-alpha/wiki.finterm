## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：商业信用（Commercial Credit）是指企业之间在商品交易过程中，以延期付款或预收货款等形式提供的信用。它起源于商品交换中的赊销行为，核心概念包括信用额度、信用期限和信用风险。商业信用是企业短期融资的重要方式之一，通常不涉及金融机构的介入。  
  **English Explanation**: Commercial Credit refers to the credit extended between businesses during the process of goods transactions, typically in the form of deferred payments or advance receipts. It originates from the practice of selling on credit in commodity exchanges, with core concepts including credit limits, credit terms, and credit risk. Commercial credit is a vital form of short-term financing for businesses, usually without the involvement of financial institutions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：商业信用广泛应用于供应链上下游企业之间的交易中。例如，供应商向采购商提供延期付款的信用，或采购商向供应商预付货款以获取折扣。应用时需注意信用风险，如买方违约或资金链断裂，可能导致卖方无法收回货款。  
  **English Application**: Commercial credit is widely used in transactions between upstream and downstream businesses in the supply chain. For example, suppliers may offer deferred payment terms to buyers, or buyers may prepay suppliers to secure discounts. When applying commercial credit, it is crucial to manage credit risks, such as buyer defaults or cash flow disruptions, which could lead to sellers being unable to recover payments.

  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, commercial credit helps alleviate financing difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises, fostering economic vitality. From an investment standpoint, a company's commercial credit status is a key indicator of its financial health.
