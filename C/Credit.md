## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  信用（Credit）是指一方（债权人）基于对另一方（债务人）未来履约能力的信任，向其提供资金、商品或服务，并约定在未来某一时间偿还本金及利息的经济行为。信用的核心概念包括信任、时间价值和风险。信用的起源可以追溯到古代的商品交换和借贷行为，现代信用体系则建立在法律和金融制度的基础上。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Credit refers to an economic activity where one party (the creditor) provides funds, goods, or services to another party (the debtor) based on trust in the latter's ability to fulfill obligations in the future, with an agreement to repay the principal and interest at a specified time. The core concepts of credit include trust, time value, and risk. Its origins trace back to ancient barter and lending practices, while modern credit systems are built on legal and financial frameworks.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  信用广泛应用于个人消费贷款、企业融资、信用卡支付、国际贸易等领域。例如，银行通过信用评估向个人发放房贷或车贷，企业通过信用债券融资。需要注意的是，信用风险（如违约）是信用活动中的主要风险，需通过严格的信用评级和风险管理来降低。  

  **English Application**  
  Credit is widely used in personal consumption loans, corporate financing, credit card payments, and international trade. For instance, banks issue mortgages or car loans to individuals based on credit assessments, and companies raise funds through credit bonds. It is important to note that credit risk (e.g., default) is a primary concern in credit activities, which requires rigorous credit ratings and risk management to mitigate.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  信用的概念可以追溯到古代文明。例如，公元前2000年的美索不达米亚文明中，农民通过借贷种子和工具进行农业生产，形成了早期的信用关系。中国古代的“赊账”制度也是信用的雏形。现代信用体系的建立始于17世纪的欧洲，随着银行和债券市场的发展，信用逐渐成为金融体系的核心。  

  **English Origin**  
  The concept of credit dates back to ancient civilizations. For example, in Mesopotamia around 2000 BCE, farmers borrowed seeds and tools for agricultural production, forming early credit relationships. In ancient China, the "credit account" system was a precursor to modern credit. The modern credit system began to take shape in 17th-century Europe, with the development of banks and bond markets, gradually becoming the cornerstone of the financial system.
