  **中文解释**：资本货物（Capital Goods）是指用于生产其他商品或服务的长期使用的资产，如机器、设备、工具和建筑物等。这些资产不直接用于消费，而是用于生产过程中，帮助企业提高生产效率或扩大生产能力。资本货物的概念最早由经济学家在分析生产函数时提出，强调其在生产过程中的核心作用。  
  **English Explanation**: Capital goods refer to long-term assets used in the production of other goods or services, such as machinery, equipment, tools, and buildings. These assets are not directly consumed but are utilized in the production process to enhance efficiency or expand production capacity. The concept of capital goods was introduced by economists in the analysis of production functions, emphasizing their central role in the production process.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：资本货物广泛应用于制造业、建筑业和基础设施建设等领域。例如，工厂中的生产线设备、建筑工地上的起重机以及发电厂的涡轮机都属于资本货物。需要注意的是，资本货物的投资通常需要大量资金，且回报周期较长，企业需谨慎评估其财务风险和市场需求。  
  **English Application**: Capital goods are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, construction, and infrastructure development. For instance, production line equipment in factories, cranes on construction sites, and turbines in power plants are all examples of capital goods. It is important to note that investments in capital goods typically require significant capital and have long payback periods, necessitating careful evaluation of financial risks and market demand.

* **重要性 / Significance**
