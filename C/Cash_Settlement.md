# Cash Settlement

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：现金结算（Cash Settlement）是指在金融交易中，双方通过现金支付而非实物交割来完成合约义务的结算方式。这种方式常见于期货、期权等衍生品市场，避免了实物交割的复杂性和成本。核心概念包括“现金支付”和“无实物交割”。  
  **English Explanation**: Cash Settlement refers to the process in financial transactions where the obligations of a contract are fulfilled through cash payment rather than the physical delivery of the underlying asset. This method is commonly used in derivatives markets such as futures and options, avoiding the complexity and cost associated with physical delivery. Key concepts include "cash payment" and "no physical delivery."

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：现金结算广泛应用于金融衍生品市场，如股指期货、利率期货等。由于这些合约的标的资产（如股票指数或利率）无法进行实物交割，现金结算成为唯一可行的方式。风险提示：现金结算可能导致价格波动风险，尤其是在市场剧烈波动时。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: Cash Settlement is widely used in derivatives markets, such as stock index futures and interest rate futures. Since the underlying assets (e.g., stock indices or interest rates) of these contracts cannot be physically delivered, cash settlement becomes the only feasible method. Risk Note: Cash settlement may lead to price volatility risks, especially during periods of significant market fluctuations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，现金结算简化了交易流程，降低了操作风险；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更灵活的交易工具；从行业角度看，现金结算促进了金融市场的流动性和效率。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, cash settlement simplifies transaction processes and reduces operational risks; from an investment perspective, it provides investors with more flexible trading instruments; from an industry perspective, cash settlement enhances the liquidity and efficiency of financial markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context
