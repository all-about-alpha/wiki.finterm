# Customer to Customer (C2C)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    C2C（Customer to Customer）是指消费者与消费者之间直接进行交易的一种商业模式。这种模式通常通过第三方平台（如淘宝、闲鱼等）实现，平台提供信息发布、支付、物流等服务，但不直接参与交易。C2C的核心概念是去中介化，让买卖双方直接对接，降低交易成本。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    C2C (Customer to Customer) refers to a business model where transactions occur directly between consumers. This model is typically facilitated by third-party platforms (such as Taobao, Xianyu, etc.), which provide services like information posting, payment processing, and logistics, but do not directly participate in the transactions. The core concept of C2C is disintermediation, enabling direct interaction between buyers and sellers to reduce transaction costs.

    C2C模式广泛应用于二手商品交易、个人服务提供（如家教、家政）等领域。在中国，淘宝、闲鱼等平台是C2C的典型代表。需要注意的是，C2C交易中存在信用风险、商品质量风险以及售后服务不完善等问题，消费者需谨慎选择交易对象。  
  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    The C2C model is widely used in areas such as second-hand goods trading and personal services (e.g., tutoring, housekeeping). In China, platforms like Taobao and Xianyu are typical examples of C2C. It is important to note that C2C transactions carry risks such as credit risk, product quality issues, and inadequate after-sales service, so consumers should carefully choose their trading partners.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**

    C2C模式的起源可以追溯到20世纪90年代末的互联网泡沫时期。随着eBay等平台的兴起，个人之间的在线交易逐渐成为一种趋势。在中国，淘宝网于2003年成立，标志着C2C模式在中国的正式起步。此后，随着移动互联网的普及，C2C交易进一步扩展到移动端，形成了如今的繁荣局面。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The origin of the C2C model can be traced back to the late 1990s during the dot-com bubble. With the rise of platforms like eBay, online transactions between individuals gradually became a trend. In China, the establishment of Taobao in 2003 marked the formal start of the C2C model. Subsequently, with the popularization of mobile internet, C2C transactions further expanded to mobile devices, leading to the current prosperous landscape.

    C2C模式对传统零售业产生了深远影响，推动了电子商务的快速发展。在中国，C2C平台不仅改变了人们的购物习惯，还创造了大量就业机会。然而，C2C的快速发展也带来了假货泛滥、信用体系不完善等问题，亟需行业和监管部门的共同努力来解决。

    The C2C model has had a profound impact on traditional retail, driving the rapid development of e-commerce.
