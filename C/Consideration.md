# Consideration

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：对价（Consideration）是合同法中的一个核心概念，指在合同订立过程中，双方为达成协议而相互提供的价值交换。对价可以是金钱、货物、服务或承诺等，必须具有法律认可的价值。对价的存在是合同具有法律约束力的前提条件之一。  
  **English Explanation**: Consideration is a fundamental concept in contract law, referring to the value exchanged between parties to form a legally binding agreement. It can be money, goods, services, or a promise, and must hold recognized legal value. The presence of consideration is one of the prerequisites for a contract to be enforceable.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：对价广泛应用于商业合同、劳动合同、买卖协议等场景。例如，在买卖合同中，买方支付货款，卖方交付商品，双方的对价分别是金钱和货物。需要注意的是，对价必须真实、合法，且具有可执行性，否则可能导致合同无效。  
  **English Application**: Consideration is widely used in commercial contracts, employment agreements, and sales contracts. For example, in a sales contract, the buyer pays money, and the seller delivers goods—the consideration for each party being money and goods, respectively. It is crucial that the consideration is genuine, lawful, and enforceable; otherwise, the contract may be deemed invalid.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从法律和商业角度来看，对价是确保合同公平性和可执行性的关键要素。它不仅是合同成立的基础，也是解决合同纠纷时的重要依据。在投资和交易中，明确对价有助于降低风险，保障各方权益。  
  **English Significance**: From legal and commercial perspectives, consideration is a critical element in ensuring the fairness and enforceability of contracts. It serves as the foundation for contract formation and is a key factor in resolving disputes. In investments and transactions, clearly defined consideration helps mitigate risks and protect the interests of all parties.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：对价的概念起源于英国普通法，最早可追溯至中世纪。当时的法院要求合同必须具有“互惠性”才能被强制执行，这一原则逐渐演变为现代对价理论。16世纪后，对价成为英美合同法中的核心原则，并在全球范围内被广泛采纳。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of consideration originated in English common law, dating back to the Middle Ages. Courts at the time required contracts to have "reciprocity" to be enforceable, a principle that evolved into the modern doctrine of consideration. By the 16th century, consideration became a cornerstone of Anglo-American contract law and was widely adopted globally.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：对价理论对全球合同法体系产生了深远影响，尤其是在英美法系国家。它不仅规范了合同的订立和执行，还为国际贸易和投资提供了法律保障。如今，对价原则已被纳入许多国家的民法典或商法典中，成为现代商业活动的基石之一。  
  **English Impact**: The doctrine of consideration has profoundly influenced global contract law systems, particularly in common law jurisdictions. It has not only standardized contract formation and enforcement but also provided legal safeguards for international trade and investment. Today, the principle of consideration is embedded in the civil or commercial codes of many countries, serving as a cornerstone of modern business practices.
