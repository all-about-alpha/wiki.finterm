# Credit Score

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  信用评分（Credit Score）是一种基于个人或企业信用历史的数值评估，用于衡量其信用风险。它由信用评级机构或金融机构根据借款人的还款记录、负债情况、信用历史长度、信用类型多样性以及新信用申请等因素计算得出。信用评分通常采用FICO评分模型或VantageScore模型，分数范围在300至850之间，分数越高代表信用风险越低。  
  **English Explanation**  
  A credit score is a numerical evaluation based on an individual's or business's credit history, used to assess their credit risk. It is calculated by credit rating agencies or financial institutions based on factors such as repayment records, debt levels, length of credit history, diversity of credit types, and new credit applications. Common models include the FICO score and VantageScore, with scores typically ranging from 300 to 850, where a higher score indicates lower credit risk.
