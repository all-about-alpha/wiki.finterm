# Correction

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  修正（Correction）是指金融市场中资产价格在经历一段时间的上涨或下跌后，出现的反向调整现象。通常，修正幅度在10%至20%之间，属于市场正常波动的一部分。修正不同于熊市，后者通常指价格下跌超过20%且持续时间较长。修正的核心概念在于市场自我调节，反映投资者情绪和估值的重新平衡。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A correction refers to a reverse adjustment in asset prices after a period of sustained upward or downward movement in financial markets. Typically, a correction involves a price decline of 10% to 20% and is considered a normal part of market fluctuations. Unlike a bear market, which involves a decline of more than 20% over a prolonged period, a correction reflects market self-regulation and the rebalancing of investor sentiment and valuations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  修正常见于股票、债券、商品等市场。例如，当某只股票因过度炒作而价格虚高时，市场可能通过修正使其回归合理估值。投资者需注意修正带来的短期风险，但也可将其视为长期投资的入场机会。修正期间，市场情绪波动较大，需谨慎操作。  
  **English Application**：  
  Corrections are commonly observed in stock, bond, and commodity markets. For instance, when a stock's price becomes inflated due to excessive speculation, a correction may bring it back to a reasonable valuation. Investors should be aware of the short-term risks associated with corrections but may also view them as opportunities for long-term investment. During corrections, market sentiment can be highly volatile, requiring cautious decision-making.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，修正有助于防止市场泡沫，维护金融稳定；从投资角度看，修正为投资者提供了重新评估资产价值和调整策略的机会；从行业角度看，修正反映了市场供需关系和投资者预期的变化，是市场健康运行的重要标志。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, corrections help prevent market bubbles and maintain financial stability. From an investment standpoint, they provide opportunities for reassessing asset values and adjusting strategies. From an industry perspective, corrections reflect changes in market supply and demand as well as investor expectations, serving as a vital indicator of a healthy market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  修正的概念最早可追溯至20世纪初的美国股市。1929年大萧条前夕，股市经历了多次修正，但最终未能阻止崩盘的发生。此后，修正逐渐被金融界视为市场自我调节的常态现象。20世纪80年代，随着技术分析和行为金融学的发展，修正的研究进一步深化。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The concept of corrections dates back to the early 20th century in the U.S. stock market. Before the Great Depression of 1929, the market experienced several corrections, though they ultimately failed to prevent the crash. Since then, corrections have been recognized as a normal part of market self-regulation. In the 1980s, with the development of technical analysis and behavioral finance, the study of corrections became more sophisticated.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：  
  修正对金融市场的影响深远。例如，1987年的“黑色星期一”股市崩盘后，市场通过修正逐步恢复，为后续牛市奠定了基础。近年来，修正现象在全球范围内频繁发生，尤其是在新兴市场和高波动性资产中。修正已成为投资者评估市场风险和制定策略的重要参考。  
  **English Impact**：  
  Corrections have had a profound impact on financial markets. For example, after the 1987 "Black Monday" stock market crash, the market gradually recovered through corrections, laying the groundwork for subsequent bull markets. In recent years, corrections have occurred frequently worldwide, particularly in emerging markets and high-volatility assets. They have become a critical reference for investors assessing market risks and formulating strategies.
