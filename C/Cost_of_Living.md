## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  生活成本的概念最早可追溯到19世纪末，随着工业革命的推进，城市化进程加快，物价波动显著。经济学家如阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）开始研究物价与生活水平的关系。20世纪初，美国劳工统计局（BLS）首次发布生活成本指数，成为全球衡量生活成本的重要参考。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of Cost of Living dates back to the late 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution, when urbanization accelerated and price fluctuations became significant. Economists such as Alfred Marshall began studying the relationship between prices and living standards. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) published the first Cost of Living Index, which became a global benchmark for measuring living costs.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  生活成本指数对全球经济产生了深远影响。例如，高生活成本城市如纽约、东京吸引了大量高技能人才，但也面临住房紧张和贫富差距问题。近年来，随着全球化和数字化发展，远程工作模式使得生活成本较低的地区成为新兴热点。  
  **English Impact**  
  The Cost of Living Index has had a profound impact on the global economy. For example, high-cost cities like New York and Tokyo attract highly skilled talent but also face challenges such as housing shortages and income inequality. In recent years, globalization and digitalization have made lower-cost regions emerging hotspots due to the rise of remote work.
