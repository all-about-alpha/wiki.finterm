# CAPE Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：CAPE比率（Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio），又称席勒市盈率，由诺贝尔经济学奖得主罗伯特·席勒（Robert Shiller）提出。它是一种衡量股票市场估值的指标，通过将当前股价与过去10年经通胀调整后的平均收益进行比较，来评估市场的长期估值水平。核心概念在于平滑经济周期对盈利的波动影响，从而提供更稳定的估值参考。  
  **English Explanation**: The CAPE Ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio), also known as the Shiller PE Ratio, was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller. It is a metric used to assess stock market valuation by comparing the current price of a market to the average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. The core concept is to smooth out the cyclical fluctuations in earnings, providing a more stable long-term valuation benchmark.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：CAPE比率常用于评估股票市场的整体估值水平，尤其是在判断市场是否处于高估或低估状态时。例如，当CAPE比率高于历史平均水平时，可能表明市场估值偏高，存在回调风险；反之，则可能表明市场被低估，存在投资机会。需要注意的是，CAPE比率更适合长期投资分析，短期市场波动可能使其信号失真。  
  **English Explanation**: The CAPE Ratio is commonly used to evaluate the overall valuation of stock markets, particularly in determining whether a market is overvalued or undervalued. For instance, a CAPE Ratio higher than its historical average may indicate an overvalued market with potential correction risks, while a lower ratio may suggest undervaluation and investment opportunities. It is important to note that the CAPE Ratio is more suitable for long-term investment analysis, as short-term market fluctuations may distort its signals.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，CAPE比率具有重要意义。它为投资者提供了一个基于历史数据的估值工具，帮助识别市场泡沫或低估机会。同时，监管机构也可参考CAPE比率来监测市场风险。在行业层面，CAPE比率被广泛用于资产配置和风险管理，尤其是在全球化和跨市场投资中。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the CAPE Ratio holds significant importance. It provides investors with a historical data-based valuation tool to identify market bubbles or undervaluation opportunities. Regulatory bodies may also use the CAPE Ratio to monitor market risks. At the industry level, the CAPE Ratio is widely used for asset allocation and risk management, particularly in globalized and cross-market investments.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：CAPE比率由罗伯特·席勒在20世纪80年代提出，其灵感来源于本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）和大卫·多德（David Dodd）在《证券分析》中提出的市盈率概念。席勒通过引入10年通胀调整后的平均收益，改进了传统市盈率的局限性，使其更能反映长期估值水平。这一方法在1996年席勒与约翰·坎贝尔（John Campbell）合著的论文中得到了进一步推广。  
  **English Explanation**: The CAPE Ratio was introduced by Robert Shiller in the 1980s, inspired by the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio concept proposed by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in their book *Security Analysis*. Shiller improved upon the limitations of the traditional PE ratio by incorporating a 10-year inflation-adjusted average earnings, making it more reflective of long-term valuation levels. This methodology was further popularized in a 1996 paper co-authored by Shiller and John Campbell.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：CAPE比率对全球金融市场产生了深远影响。它被广泛应用于股票市场估值分析，尤其是在2000年互联网泡沫和2008年金融危机期间，CAPE比率成功预警了市场的高估风险。如今，CAPE比率已成为投资者、分析师和学术研究的重要工具，并在全球范围内被用于评估不同市场的估值水平。  
  **English Explanation**: The CAPE Ratio has had a profound impact on global financial markets. It is widely used for stock market valuation analysis, particularly during the 2000 dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis, where it successfully warned of overvaluation risks. Today, the CAPE Ratio is an essential tool for investors, analysts, and academic research, and is used globally to assess valuation levels across different markets.
