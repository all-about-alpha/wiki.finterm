# Equity Risk Premium

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  股权风险溢价（Equity Risk Premium, ERP）是指投资者因持有股票而非无风险资产（如国债）所要求的额外回报率。它反映了股票市场相对于无风险资产的风险补偿。这一概念由金融学家在资本资产定价模型（CAPM）中提出，核心在于衡量市场风险与预期收益之间的关系。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is the additional return that investors demand for holding stocks over risk-free assets (such as government bonds). It reflects the compensation for the higher risk associated with equities compared to risk-free investments. This concept originated from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and is central to understanding the relationship between market risk and expected returns.

Investors utilize ERP to assess the attractiveness of the stock market and decide whether to shift funds from low-risk assets to equities. In asset allocation, ERP helps determine the appropriate balance between stocks and bonds. It is important to note that ERP calculations rely on historical data and market expectations, which may introduce biases.
