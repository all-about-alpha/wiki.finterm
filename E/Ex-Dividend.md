# Ex-Dividend

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：除息（Ex-Dividend）是指股票在分红派息后，其价格会相应调整，以反映公司已经支付了股息。在除息日当天或之后购买该股票的投资者将无权领取本次股息。这一概念源于股票市场的交易规则，旨在确保股息的公平分配。  
  **English Explanation**: Ex-Dividend refers to the adjustment of a stock's price after a dividend has been paid, reflecting that the company has distributed the dividend. Investors who purchase the stock on or after the ex-dividend date are not entitled to receive the current dividend. This concept originates from stock market trading rules, ensuring fair distribution of dividends.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：除息日通常在股息支付日前一个交易日确定。投资者在除息日前持有股票才能获得股息。需要注意的是，除息后股票价格通常会下跌，跌幅大致等于股息金额。投资者在交易时应考虑这一因素，避免因价格波动造成损失。  
  **English Application**: The ex-dividend date is typically set one trading day before the dividend payment date. Only investors holding the stock before the ex-dividend date are eligible to receive the dividend. It is important to note that the stock price usually drops by approximately the amount of the dividend after the ex-dividend date. Investors should consider this factor in their trading strategies to avoid losses due to price fluctuations.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：除息的概念最早可追溯到19世纪的美国股市。当时，股票交易以纸质形式进行，股息支付流程复杂。为确保股息分配的公平性，交易所引入了除息规则，规定在特定日期后购买股票的投资者无权领取股息。这一规则后来被全球股市广泛采用。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of ex-dividend dates back to the 19th century in the U.S. stock market. At that time, stock trading was conducted in paper form, and the dividend payment process was complex. To ensure fairness in dividend distribution, exchanges introduced the ex-dividend rule, stipulating that investors purchasing stocks after a specific date would not be entitled to the dividend. This rule was later widely adopted by global stock markets.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：除息规则对股票市场产生了深远影响。它不仅规范了股息分配流程，还影响了投资者的交易行为。例如，一些投资者会在除息日前买入股票以获取股息，而在除息日后卖出，这种策略被称为“股息捕捉”。如今，除息已成为全球股市的基础制度之一。  
  **English Impact**: The ex-dividend rule has had a profound impact on stock markets. It not only standardized the dividend distribution process but also influenced investor trading behavior. For example, some investors buy stocks before the ex-dividend date to capture dividends and sell them afterward, a strategy known as "dividend capture." Today, ex-dividend is a fundamental system in global stock markets.
