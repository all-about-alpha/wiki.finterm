## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  经济复苏的概念最早可追溯至20世纪初的经济周期理论。1929年大萧条后，凯恩斯提出通过政府干预刺激经济复苏的理论，成为现代宏观经济学的基石。2008年全球金融危机后，各国通过量化宽松等政策推动经济复苏，进一步丰富了这一概念的内涵。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of economic recovery can be traced back to early 20th-century economic cycle theories. Following the Great Depression of 1929, Keynes proposed the theory of government intervention to stimulate economic recovery, which became a cornerstone of modern macroeconomics. After the 2008 global financial crisis, countries implemented policies such as quantitative easing to drive recovery, further enriching the concept.

* **影响 / Impact**

  经济复苏对各行各业均有深远影响。例如，制造业和建筑业通常在复苏初期表现强劲，而科技和服务业则在复苏后期迎来快速增长。当前，全球经济复苏面临供应链中断、能源危机等挑战，但数字化和绿色经济为复苏提供了新动力。  
  **English Impact**  
  Economic recovery has profound impacts across industries. For instance, manufacturing and construction often show strong performance in the early stages of recovery, while technology and services experience rapid growth in later phases.
