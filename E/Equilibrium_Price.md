# Equilibrium Price

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：均衡价格是指在市场上，供给量与需求量相等时的价格水平。这一概念由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）在其著作《经济学原理》中首次系统阐述。均衡价格是市场供需关系的核心体现，反映了买卖双方在某一价格水平上达成一致的状态。  
  **English Explanation**: The equilibrium price is the price level at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded in a market. This concept was first systematically articulated by economist Alfred Marshall in his work *Principles of Economics*. The equilibrium price represents the core of market supply and demand dynamics, reflecting a state where buyers and sellers agree on a price level.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：均衡价格广泛应用于经济学分析、市场定价策略以及政策制定中。例如，在农产品市场中，政府可能通过调节供给或需求来稳定均衡价格，防止价格波动过大。需要注意的是，市场外部因素（如政策干预、自然灾害）可能导致均衡价格偏离理论值，从而引发市场失衡。  
  **English Explanation**: The equilibrium price is widely applied in economic analysis, market pricing strategies, and policy formulation. For instance, in agricultural markets, governments may stabilize the equilibrium price by adjusting supply or demand to prevent excessive price fluctuations. It is important to note that external factors (e.g., policy interventions, natural disasters) can cause the equilibrium price to deviate from its theoretical value, leading to market imbalances.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，均衡价格是评估市场效率的重要指标；从投资角度看，它帮助投资者判断资产的内在价值；从行业角度看，均衡价格为企业制定生产计划和定价策略提供了科学依据。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the equilibrium price is a key indicator for assessing market efficiency. From an investment standpoint, it helps investors determine the intrinsic value of assets. From an industry perspective, the equilibrium price provides a scientific basis for businesses to formulate production plans and pricing strategies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：均衡价格的概念起源于19世纪末的经济学理论，由阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔在其1890年出版的《经济学原理》中首次系统提出。马歇尔通过供需曲线的交叉点形象地展示了均衡价格的形成过程，这一理论成为新古典经济学的基石之一。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of equilibrium price originated in late 19th-century economic theory and was first systematically proposed by Alfred Marshall in his 1890 publication *Principles of Economics*. Marshall illustrated the formation of equilibrium price through the intersection of supply and demand curves, a theory that became one of the cornerstones of neoclassical economics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：均衡价格理论对现代经济学和市场分析产生了深远影响。它不仅为微观经济学提供了基础框架，还被广泛应用于宏观经济政策制定中。例如，在通货膨胀或通货紧缩时期，政府通过调节供需来影响均衡价格，从而实现经济稳定。  
  **English Explanation**: The theory of equilibrium price has had a profound impact on modern economics and market analysis. It not only provides a foundational framework for microeconomics but is also widely applied in macroeconomic policy formulation. For example, during periods of inflation or deflation, governments influence the equilibrium price by adjusting supply and demand to achieve economic stability.
