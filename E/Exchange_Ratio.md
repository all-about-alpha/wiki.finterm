## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  **中文解释**：  
  交换比率（Exchange Ratio）是指在企业并购或重组过程中，收购方公司向被收购方公司股东提供的股份交换比例。它决定了被收购方股东每持有一股股票可以换取多少股收购方的股票。这一比率通常由双方协商确定，并受到市场条件、公司估值和交易结构等因素的影响。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  The Exchange Ratio refers to the ratio at which the acquiring company offers its shares to the shareholders of the target company during a merger or acquisition. It determines how many shares of the acquiring company's stock the target company's shareholders will receive for each share they own. This ratio is typically negotiated between the parties and influenced by market conditions, company valuations, and the structure of the transaction.
