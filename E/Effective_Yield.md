# Effective Yield

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：有效收益率（Effective Yield）是指投资者在考虑复利效应后，实际获得的年化收益率。它通常用于衡量债券或其他固定收益证券的实际回报率，考虑了利息再投资的影响。有效收益率高于名义收益率，因为它反映了复利的作用。  
  - **English Explanation**: Effective Yield refers to the annualized rate of return that an investor actually earns, taking into account the effect of compounding. It is commonly used to measure the actual return on bonds or other fixed-income securities, considering the reinvestment of interest. The effective yield is higher than the nominal yield because it reflects the impact of compounding.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：有效收益率广泛应用于债券投资、储蓄账户和贷款产品中。投资者使用有效收益率来比较不同投资产品的实际回报，尤其是在利率波动较大的市场中。需要注意的是，有效收益率假设所有利息都能以相同的利率再投资，这在实际操作中可能难以实现。  
  - **English Application**: Effective Yield is widely used in bond investments, savings accounts, and loan products. Investors use it to compare the actual returns of different investment products, especially in markets with significant interest rate fluctuations. It is important to note that the effective yield assumes that all interest can be reinvested at the same rate, which may be difficult to achieve in practice.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，有效收益率是评估投资产品真实回报的重要指标。它帮助投资者做出更明智的决策，同时也为金融机构提供了定价和风险管理的依据。  
  - **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, effective yield is a crucial metric for evaluating the true return on investment products. It helps investors make more informed decisions and provides financial institutions with a basis for pricing and risk management.
