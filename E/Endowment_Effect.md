# Endowment Effect

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：禀赋效应（Endowment Effect）是指人们对自己拥有的物品赋予比实际市场价值更高的心理价值。这一概念由理查德·塞勒（Richard Thaler）于1980年提出，是行为经济学的重要理论之一。核心概念在于，人们倾向于高估自己拥有的物品，导致在交易中表现出非理性行为。  
  **English Explanation**: The Endowment Effect refers to the phenomenon where individuals ascribe a higher value to items they own compared to their actual market value. This concept was introduced by Richard Thaler in 1980 and is a key theory in behavioral economics. The core idea is that people tend to overvalue their possessions, leading to irrational behavior in transactions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：禀赋效应在消费行为、投资决策和谈判中广泛存在。例如，消费者在出售二手商品时往往定价过高，导致交易难以达成；投资者可能因过度自信而持有亏损资产，不愿及时止损。需要注意的是，这种心理偏差可能导致资源配置效率低下。  
  **English Explanation**: The Endowment Effect is widely observed in consumer behavior, investment decisions, and negotiations. For instance, consumers often overprice second-hand goods, making transactions difficult; investors may hold onto losing assets due to overconfidence, failing to cut losses in time. It is important to note that this psychological bias can lead to inefficient resource allocation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，禀赋效应揭示了市场中的非理性行为，为政策制定者提供了改进市场效率的依据。从投资角度看，理解这一效应有助于避免决策偏差，优化资产配置。从行业角度看，企业可以利用这一效应设计营销策略，如免费试用或所有权体验。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, the Endowment Effect highlights irrational behavior in markets, providing policymakers with insights to improve market efficiency. From an investment perspective, understanding this effect helps avoid decision-making biases and optimize asset allocation. From an industry perspective, businesses can leverage this effect in marketing strategies, such as free trials or ownership experiences.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：禀赋效应的概念最早由理查德·塞勒在1980年提出，他通过实验发现，人们对自己拥有的物品（如咖啡杯）的估价远高于未拥有时的估价。这一发现挑战了传统经济学中的“理性人假设”，为行为经济学的发展奠定了基础。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of the Endowment Effect was first introduced by Richard Thaler in 1980. Through experiments, he discovered that people value items they own (e.g., coffee mugs) much higher than those they do not own. This finding challenged the "rational agent" assumption in traditional economics and laid the foundation for behavioral economics.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：禀赋效应在行为经济学领域产生了深远影响，推动了人们对非理性决策的研究。如今，这一理论被广泛应用于市场营销、金融投资和公共政策设计。例如，在定价策略中，企业通过赋予消费者“所有权感”来提高产品价值感知。  
  **English Explanation**: The Endowment Effect has had a profound impact on behavioral economics, advancing research on irrational decision-making. Today, this theory is widely applied in marketing, financial investment, and public policy design. For example, in pricing strategies, businesses enhance perceived product value by giving consumers a "sense of ownership."
