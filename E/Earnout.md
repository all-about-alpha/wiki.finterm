# Earnout

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Earnout（盈利支付）是一种在企业并购交易中常见的财务安排，指买方在收购完成后，根据被收购方未来一定时期内的业绩表现，向卖方支付额外的对价。这种安排通常用于弥补买卖双方对目标公司估值的分歧，确保卖方在交易后仍能通过努力实现更高的收益。  
  **English Explanation**: An earnout is a financial arrangement commonly used in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) where the buyer agrees to pay the seller additional consideration based on the future performance of the acquired company. This mechanism is often employed to bridge valuation gaps between buyers and sellers, ensuring that sellers can achieve higher returns post-transaction through continued performance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Earnout通常应用于并购交易中，尤其是当买卖双方对目标公司的未来盈利能力存在分歧时。例如，在科技公司或初创企业的收购中，由于未来收入不确定性较高，Earnout条款可以作为一种折衷方案。需要注意的是，Earnout条款的设计需明确业绩指标、支付条件和时间框架，以避免后续纠纷。  
  **English Application**: Earnouts are typically used in M&A transactions, particularly when there is a disagreement between buyers and sellers regarding the future profitability of the target company. For instance, in acquisitions of tech companies or startups, where future revenue is highly uncertain, earnout provisions serve as a compromise. It is crucial to clearly define performance metrics, payment terms, and timelines in earnout agreements to avoid disputes.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，Earnout有助于平衡交易双方的利益，减少因估值分歧导致的交易失败。从投资角度看，它为买方降低了前期支付压力，同时激励卖方在交易后继续提升业绩。从行业角度看，Earnout在科技、医药等高增长行业的并购中尤为常见，推动了创新企业的整合与发展。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, earnouts help balance the interests of both parties, reducing the likelihood of deal failures due to valuation disagreements. From an investment standpoint, they reduce upfront payment pressure for buyers while incentivizing sellers to enhance performance post-transaction. In industries like technology and pharmaceuticals, earnouts are particularly prevalent, facilitating the integration and growth of innovative companies.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **English Origin**: The concept of earnouts dates back to the mid-20th century in the U.S. M&A market. As corporate acquisitions increased, disagreements over target company valuations became more pronounced. To address this, earnouts were introduced as a flexible payment mechanism, initially applied in the acquisition of small and medium-sized enterprises.
