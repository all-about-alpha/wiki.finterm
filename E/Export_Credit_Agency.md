* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：出口信用机构广泛应用于大型基础设施项目、能源项目以及制造业出口等领域。例如，中国出口信用保险公司（Sinosure）为中国企业提供出口信用保险，帮助其应对海外买家违约或政治风险。需要注意的是，ECA的支持通常与国家的贸易政策紧密相关，因此企业在申请时需符合相关政策和条件。  
  **English Explanation**: Export Credit Agencies are widely used in large-scale infrastructure projects, energy projects, and manufacturing exports. For example, Sinosure, China's export credit insurance company, provides export credit insurance to Chinese enterprises to help them cope with overseas buyer defaults or political risks. It is important to note that ECA support is often closely tied to national trade policies, so companies must meet relevant policy requirements when applying.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：出口信用机构的起源可以追溯到20世纪初。第一次世界大战后，各国为恢复经济，开始设立专门的机构支持出口贸易。例如，英国于1919年成立了出口信用担保局（ECGD），这是世界上最早的ECA之一。中国出口信用保险公司（Sinosure）则成立于2001年，是中国唯一的政策性出口信用保险机构。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of Export Credit Agencies dates back to the early 20th century. After World War I, countries began establishing specialized institutions to support export trade as part of economic recovery efforts. For example, the UK established the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) in 1919, one of the world's earliest ECAs. China's Sinosure was founded in 2001 as the country's sole policy-oriented export credit insurance institution.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：出口信用机构对全球贸易格局产生了深远影响。它们不仅帮助发展中国家获得融资支持，还推动了发达国家的高端制造业出口。目前，ECA已成为国际贸易中不可或缺的组成部分，尤其是在“一带一路”等大型国际合作项目中，ECA的作用愈发显著。  
  **English Explanation**: Export Credit Agencies have had a profound impact on the global trade landscape. They not only help developing countries secure financing but also promote the export of high-end manufacturing from developed countries. Today, ECAs have become an indispensable part of international trade, particularly in large-scale international cooperation projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative, where their role is increasingly prominent.
