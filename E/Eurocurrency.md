## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  欧洲货币（Eurocurrency）是指存放在发行国以外的银行中的外币存款。例如，存放在英国银行的美元存款或存放在法国银行的日元存款。欧洲货币市场起源于20世纪50年代，最初以欧洲美元为主，后来扩展到其他货币。其核心概念是货币的离岸化，即货币在发行国以外的金融市场上流通和交易。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Eurocurrency refers to currency deposits held in banks outside the country of their origin. For example, US dollars deposited in a British bank or Japanese yen held in a French bank. The Eurocurrency market originated in the 1950s, initially centered around Eurodollars, and later expanded to include other currencies. Its core concept is the offshore circulation and trading of currencies in financial markets outside their country of issuance.

  欧洲货币广泛应用于国际贸易融资、跨境投资和外汇交易中。由于其不受发行国监管，欧洲货币市场为企业和金融机构提供了更灵活的融资渠道和更高的利率回报。然而，这也带来了汇率风险、流动性风险和监管套利等问题。  

  **English Application**  
  Eurocurrency is widely used in international trade financing, cross-border investments, and foreign exchange transactions. As it is not subject to the regulations of the issuing country, the Eurocurrency market offers businesses and financial institutions more flexible financing options and higher interest returns. However, it also introduces risks such as exchange rate volatility, liquidity risks, and regulatory arbitrage.
