  **English Explanation**: The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a union of EU member states established to achieve economic integration and monetary unification.

  **English Application**: The EMU is primarily applied in the functioning of the Eurozone, including cross-border trade, investment, and financial market integration. Member states benefit from reduced exchange rate risks through a unified monetary policy but also face risks such as insufficient coordination of economic policies, as seen in sovereign debt crises.

From an investment perspective, the euro as a global reserve currency enhances the attractiveness of European financial markets. From an industry perspective, the EMU fosters economic cooperation and competition among member states.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

  **English Origin**: The concept of the EMU dates back to the 1970s "Werner Plan," but its formal launch followed the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. The euro was introduced as an accounting currency in 1999, with euro banknotes and coins entering circulation in 2002.

* **影响 / Impact**
