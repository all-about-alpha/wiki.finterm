## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  盈利预测的概念起源于20世纪80年代的美国资本市场。随着上市公司数量的增加和投资者对信息透明度的需求提升，公司管理层开始主动披露未来业绩预期。1995年，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）通过《私人证券诉讼改革法案》（PSLRA），为前瞻性陈述提供了法律保护，进一步推动了盈利预测的普及。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of earnings guidance originated in the U.S. capital markets in the 1980s. As the number of public companies grew and investor demand for transparency increased, company management began proactively disclosing future performance expectations. In 1995, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), providing legal protection for forward-looking statements and further popularizing earnings guidance.
