# Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：经济订货量（EOQ）是一种库存管理模型，用于确定企业在一定时间内应订购的最优数量，以最小化总库存成本，包括订购成本和持有成本。该模型由福特·W·哈里斯（Ford W. Harris）于1913年首次提出，核心概念是通过平衡订购频率和库存持有量来实现成本最优。  
  **English Explanation**: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is an inventory management model used to determine the optimal quantity a business should order within a given period to minimize total inventory costs, including ordering costs and holding costs. The model was first introduced by Ford W. Harris in 1913, with the core concept of achieving cost optimization by balancing order frequency and inventory holding levels.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：EOQ广泛应用于制造业、零售业和物流行业，特别是在需求稳定、库存成本可控的场景中。企业通过计算EOQ可以优化采购计划，减少资金占用和仓储压力。然而，EOQ的应用需注意需求波动、价格变化和供应链中断等风险，否则可能导致库存过剩或短缺。  
  **English Explanation**: EOQ is widely used in manufacturing, retail, and logistics industries, particularly in scenarios with stable demand and controllable inventory costs. By calculating EOQ, businesses can optimize procurement plans, reduce capital occupation, and alleviate storage pressure. However, its application requires attention to risks such as demand fluctuations, price changes, and supply chain disruptions, which may lead to overstocking or shortages.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，EOQ是库存管理的重要工具。它帮助企业提高运营效率，降低库存成本，从而增强竞争力。对于投资者而言，采用EOQ模型的企业通常表现出更好的财务健康状况和更高的投资回报率。  
  **English Explanation**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, EOQ is a critical tool for inventory management. It helps businesses improve operational efficiency, reduce inventory costs, and enhance competitiveness. For investors, companies adopting the EOQ model often exhibit better financial health and higher return on investment.
