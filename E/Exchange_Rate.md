# Exchange Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  汇率（Exchange Rate）是指一国货币与另一国货币之间的兑换比率。它反映了一国货币相对于另一国货币的价值。汇率的形成通常由市场供求关系决定，但也可能受到政府干预的影响。核心概念包括直接标价法和间接标价法，前者表示一单位外币兑换多少本币，后者表示一单位本币兑换多少外币。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The exchange rate is the rate at which one country's currency can be exchanged for another country's currency. It reflects the value of one currency relative to another. Exchange rates are typically determined by market supply and demand but can also be influenced by government intervention. Key concepts include direct quotation and indirect quotation, where the former indicates how much domestic currency is needed to buy one unit of foreign currency, and the latter indicates how much foreign currency is needed to buy one unit of domestic currency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**  
  汇率在国际贸易、投资和旅游中具有广泛应用。例如，进口商需要将本币兑换成外币以支付货款，出口商则需要将外币兑换成本币。汇率波动可能带来汇兑风险，企业通常通过外汇对冲工具来管理这种风险。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Exchange rates are widely used in international trade, investment, and tourism. For example, importers need to convert domestic currency into foreign currency to pay for goods, while exporters need to convert foreign currency into domestic currency. Exchange rate fluctuations can lead to currency risk, and businesses often use hedging instruments to manage this risk.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**  
  汇率对国家的经济政策、国际贸易和资本流动具有重要影响。从监管角度看，汇率政策是央行调控经济的重要工具；从投资角度看，汇率变动直接影响跨境投资的收益；从行业角度看，汇率波动会影响企业的成本和利润。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Exchange rates have a significant impact on national economic policies, international trade, and capital flows. From a regulatory perspective, exchange rate policy is a crucial tool for central banks to regulate the economy. From an investment perspective, exchange rate movements directly affect the returns on cross-border investments. From an industry perspective, exchange rate fluctuations can impact corporate costs and profits.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**  
  汇率的起源可以追溯到古代贸易时期，当时不同地区使用不同的货币进行交易。现代汇率制度的形成始于19世纪的金本位制，各国货币与黄金挂钩，汇率相对稳定。20世纪70年代，布雷顿森林体系崩溃后，浮动汇率制度逐渐成为主流。  
  **English Explanation**  
  The origin of exchange rates dates back to ancient trade periods when different regions used different currencies for transactions. The modern exchange rate system began with the gold standard in the 19th century, where currencies were pegged to gold, leading to relatively stable exchange rates. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s, floating exchange rates became the norm.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**  
  汇率制度的变化对全球经济产生了深远影响。固定汇率制度曾促进国际贸易的稳定，但缺乏灵活性；浮动汇率制度则增强了市场调节功能，但也带来了更大的波动性。当前，大多数国家采用有管理的浮动汇率制度，以平衡稳定性和灵活性。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Changes in exchange rate systems have had profound impacts on the global economy. Fixed exchange rates once promoted stability in international trade but lacked flexibility. Floating exchange rates enhance market regulation but also introduce greater volatility. Currently, most countries adopt a managed floating exchange rate system to balance stability and flexibility.
