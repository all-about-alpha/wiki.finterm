# Enterprise-Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：企业价值与收入倍数（EV/R）是一种估值比率，用于衡量企业的市场价值与其收入之间的关系。它通过将企业的总价值（包括债务和股权）除以其总收入来计算。这一指标常用于评估企业的相对估值，尤其是在收入增长较快但盈利能力尚未稳定的公司中。  
  - **English Explanation**: The Enterprise-Value-to-Revenue Multiple (EV/R) is a valuation ratio that measures the relationship between a company's market value and its revenue. It is calculated by dividing the total enterprise value (including debt and equity) by its total revenue. This metric is commonly used to assess the relative valuation of a company, particularly for firms with high revenue growth but unstable profitability.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：EV/R常用于科技、互联网等高增长行业的估值分析，因为这些行业的公司可能在早期阶段收入增长迅速但利润较低。投资者可以通过比较同行业公司的EV/R倍数来判断某公司是否被高估或低估。需要注意的是，EV/R倍数较低可能意味着公司被低估，但也可能反映其盈利能力或增长潜力不足。  
  - **English Application**: EV/R is frequently used in valuation analysis for high-growth industries such as technology and internet companies, where firms may experience rapid revenue growth but low profitability in their early stages. Investors can compare the EV/R multiples of companies within the same industry to determine if a company is overvalued or undervalued. It is important to note that a low EV/R multiple may indicate undervaluation but could also reflect weak profitability or growth potential.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从投资角度来看，EV/R提供了一个相对简单的估值工具，尤其适用于收入驱动型公司。从监管角度来看，EV/R可以帮助评估企业的市场价值是否合理，从而为政策制定提供参考。在行业中，EV/R被广泛用于并购交易和IPO定价中，作为衡量企业价值的重要指标。  
  - **English Significance**: From an investment perspective, EV/R provides a relatively simple valuation tool, especially for revenue-driven companies. From a regulatory standpoint, EV/R can help assess whether a company's market value is reasonable, thereby informing policy decisions. In the industry, EV/R is widely used in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and IPO pricing as a key metric for evaluating enterprise value.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：EV/R的概念起源于20世纪90年代，随着互联网和高科技行业的兴起，传统的市盈率（P/E）等估值指标无法充分反映这些高增长、低利润公司的价值。EV/R作为一种补充指标逐渐被投资者和分析师采用，特别是在2000年互联网泡沫期间，其重要性进一步凸显。  
  - **English Origin**: The concept of EV/R emerged in the 1990s with the rise of the internet and high-tech industries, where traditional valuation metrics like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio failed to adequately capture the value of high-growth, low-profit companies. EV/R gradually gained adoption among investors and analysts as a supplementary metric, particularly during the dot-com bubble of 2000, when its significance became more pronounced.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**：EV/R的引入改变了传统估值方法，特别是在高增长行业的应用中，为投资者提供了更全面的视角。如今，EV/R已成为全球资本市场中广泛使用的估值工具之一，尤其在科技、生物医药等新兴行业中具有重要地位。  
  - **English Impact**: The introduction of EV/R transformed traditional valuation methods, particularly in high-growth industries, providing investors with a more comprehensive perspective. Today, EV/R is one of the widely used valuation tools in global capital markets, especially in emerging sectors such as technology and biopharmaceuticals.
