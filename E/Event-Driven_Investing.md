* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：事件驱动型投资（Event-Driven Investing）是一种投资策略，专注于利用公司特定事件（如并购、重组、破产、分拆、诉讼等）引发的市场波动来获取收益。这种策略通常由对冲基金或专业投资者采用，通过分析事件对股价的潜在影响，进行买入或卖出的操作。  
  **English Explanation**: Event-Driven Investing is an investment strategy that focuses on capitalizing on market fluctuations caused by specific corporate events, such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, bankruptcies, spin-offs, or litigation. This strategy is typically employed by hedge funds or professional investors who analyze the potential impact of these events on stock prices to make buy or sell decisions.

* **应用 / Application**

  **English Explanation**: Event-Driven Investing is widely applied in areas such as merger arbitrage, distressed securities investing, and shareholder activism.
