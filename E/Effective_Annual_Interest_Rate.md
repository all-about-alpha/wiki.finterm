  **English Explanation**: The Effective Annual Interest Rate (EAR) is the actual interest rate earned or paid on an investment or loan over a year, taking into account the effect of compounding.

  **中文应用场景**：有效年利率广泛应用于银行储蓄、贷款、债券和投资产品的收益比较中。例如，投资者在选择定期存款或理财产品时，可通过有效年利率评估实际收益。需要注意的是，复利频率（如按月、按季度）会显著影响计算结果，投资者应仔细阅读产品条款。  
  **English Application**: The EAR is widely used in comparing returns on bank deposits, loans, bonds, and investment products. For instance, when choosing between fixed deposits or wealth management products, investors can use the EAR to evaluate actual returns. It is important to note that the compounding frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly) significantly impacts the calculation, and investors should carefully review product terms.
