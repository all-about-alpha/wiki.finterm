## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：事件风险的概念最早可追溯到20世纪80年代的金融市场。当时，企业并购浪潮兴起，许多公司因被收购或杠杆收购（LBO）而面临股价剧烈波动，投资者开始意识到特定事件对投资价值的重大影响。1997年亚洲金融危机和2001年“9·11”事件进一步凸显了事件风险的广泛性和破坏性。  
  **English Explanation**: The concept of event risk can be traced back to the financial markets of the 1980s. During this period, a wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions emerged, with many companies experiencing significant stock price volatility due to takeovers or leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Investors began to recognize the substantial impact of specific events on investment value. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2001 "9/11" attacks further highlighted the widespread and destructive nature of event risk.
