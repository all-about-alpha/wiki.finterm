# EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  - **中文解释**：EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio（EBITDA利息覆盖率）是衡量企业支付利息能力的重要财务指标。它通过将企业的息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）除以其利息支出，来评估企业在支付利息方面的财务健康状况。该比率越高，表明企业支付利息的能力越强，财务风险越低。  
  - **English Explanation**: The EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio is a key financial metric used to assess a company's ability to pay interest expenses. It is calculated by dividing a company's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) by its interest expenses. A higher ratio indicates a stronger ability to cover interest payments and lower financial risk.

However, it is important to note that this ratio does not account for capital expenditures or taxes, so it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics.
