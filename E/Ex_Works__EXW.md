# Ex Works (EXW)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  Ex Works（EXW）是国际贸易术语之一，由国际商会（ICC）在《国际贸易术语解释通则》（Incoterms）中定义。EXW表示卖方在其所在地（如工厂、仓库等）将货物交给买方，即完成交货义务。买方承担从卖方所在地提货至目的地的所有费用和风险，包括运输、保险、报关等。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Ex Works (EXW) is one of the international trade terms defined by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in the International Commercial Terms (Incoterms). EXW means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer at the seller's premises (e.g., factory, warehouse), thereby fulfilling the delivery obligation. The buyer assumes all costs and risks from the seller's location to the destination, including transportation, insurance, and customs clearance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  EXW适用于买方在卖方所在地有较强物流能力或熟悉当地运输和报关流程的情况。常见于买卖双方关系紧密或买方在卖方所在国有分支机构。需注意，买方需自行安排提货和运输，可能面临较高的物流成本和风险。  
  **English Application**  
  EXW is suitable when the buyer has strong logistics capabilities or is familiar with local transportation and customs procedures at the seller's location. It is commonly used when the buyer and seller have a close relationship or when the buyer has a branch in the seller's country. Note that the buyer must arrange pickup and transportation, which may involve higher logistics costs and risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  EXW是国际贸易中最基础的术语之一，明确了买卖双方的责任划分，尤其适用于买方希望完全控制运输和物流环节的情况。从监管角度看，EXW简化了卖方的义务，但买方需承担更多责任，因此需谨慎评估自身能力。  
  **English Significance**  
  EXW is one of the most fundamental terms in international trade, clearly delineating the responsibilities of buyers and sellers. It is particularly suitable when the buyer wishes to fully control the transportation and logistics process. From a regulatory perspective, EXW simplifies the seller's obligations but places more responsibility on the buyer, requiring careful assessment of capabilities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  EXW的广泛应用促进了国际贸易的便利化，尤其适用于买方主导物流的贸易模式。然而，由于买方需承担更多责任，EXW也可能增加买方的运营成本和风险。目前，EXW仍是中小型企业常用的贸易术语之一。  
  **English Impact**  
  The widespread use of EXW has facilitated international trade, particularly in buyer-led logistics models. However, as the buyer assumes more responsibilities, EXW may also increase operational costs and risks. Currently, EXW remains one of the most commonly used trade terms for small and medium-sized enterprises.
