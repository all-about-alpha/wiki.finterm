# Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  《1981年经济复苏税收法案》（Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981，简称ERTA）是美国国会于1981年通过的一项重大税收改革法案，由时任总统罗纳德·里根（Ronald Reagan）签署生效。该法案的核心目标是刺激经济增长，通过大幅降低个人所得税和企业所得税税率，鼓励投资和消费，从而推动经济复苏。ERTA被视为“里根经济学”（Reaganomics）的重要组成部分，强调通过减税和减少政府干预来促进市场自由化。  

  **English Explanation**  
  The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) was a significant tax reform legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 1981 and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The primary objective of ERTA was to stimulate economic growth by substantially reducing individual and corporate income tax rates, thereby encouraging investment and consumption to drive economic recovery. ERTA is considered a cornerstone of "Reaganomics," which emphasizes tax cuts and reduced government intervention to promote market liberalization.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  ERTA的主要应用场景包括个人所得税减免、企业税负降低以及资本投资的税收优惠。该法案通过降低边际税率，增加了个人可支配收入，从而刺激消费；同时，企业税负的减轻鼓励了企业扩大生产和投资。然而，该法案也带来了财政赤字扩大的风险，因为减税导致政府收入减少，而支出并未相应削减。  

  **English Application Scenarios**  
  ERTA's primary applications included reductions in individual income taxes, lower corporate tax burdens, and tax incentives for capital investments. By lowering marginal tax rates, the act increased disposable income for individuals, thereby stimulating consumption. Simultaneously, reduced corporate taxes encouraged businesses to expand production and investment. However, the act also posed risks of widening fiscal deficits, as tax cuts led to decreased government revenue without corresponding reductions in spending.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，ERTA标志着美国税收政策从高税率向低税率的转变，为后续的税改奠定了基础。从投资角度看，减税政策提升了市场信心，吸引了更多资本流入。从行业角度看，ERTA促进了制造业和服务业的发展，尤其是中小企业受益于税负减轻。然而，该法案也引发了关于财政赤字和收入不平等的长期争议。  

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, ERTA marked a shift in U.S. tax policy from high to low tax rates, laying the groundwork for subsequent tax reforms. From an investment standpoint, the tax cuts boosted market confidence and attracted increased capital inflows. From an industry perspective, ERTA fostered growth in manufacturing and services, particularly benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises through reduced tax burdens. However, the act also sparked long-term debates over fiscal deficits and income inequality.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  ERTA的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代末的美国经济滞胀（stagflation）时期，当时高通胀和高失业率并存，经济增长停滞。里根总统上台后，提出了以减税为核心的“里根经济学”政策，旨在通过供给侧改革（supply-side economics）刺激经济。ERTA于1981年8月13日由里根签署生效，成为其经济政策的重要里程碑。  

  **English Origin**  
  The origins of ERTA can be traced back to the late 1970s, a period of stagflation in the U.S. economy characterized by high inflation and high unemployment alongside stagnant growth. Upon taking office, President Reagan introduced "Reaganomics," centered on tax cuts, as part of a supply-side economics approach to stimulate the economy. ERTA was signed into law by Reagan on August 13, 1981, marking a significant milestone in his economic policy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  ERTA对美国经济产生了深远影响。短期内，减税政策刺激了消费和投资，推动了1980年代的经济复苏。然而，长期来看，减税导致联邦财政赤字大幅增加，国债规模迅速膨胀。此外，ERTA加剧了收入不平等，因为高收入群体从减税中获益更多。尽管如此，ERTA为后续税改提供了重要参考，其核心理念至今仍影响美国经济政策。  

  **English Impact**  
  ERTA had a profound impact on the U.S. economy. In the short term, tax cuts stimulated consumption and investment, driving economic recovery in the 1980s. However, in the long term, the tax reductions led to significant increases in federal budget deficits and a rapid expansion of national debt. Additionally, ERTA exacerbated income inequality, as higher-income groups benefited disproportionately from the tax cuts. Despite these challenges, ERTA provided a critical reference for subsequent tax reforms, and its core principles continue to influence U.S. economic policy today.
