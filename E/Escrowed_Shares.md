# Escrowed Shares

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：托管股份（Escrowed Shares）是指在公司并购、重组或上市等特定交易中，由第三方托管机构暂时持有的股份。这些股份通常由公司股东或管理层提供，作为交易完成或特定条件满足的担保。托管股份的核心概念在于通过第三方托管机制，确保交易的公平性和安全性，防止股份在交易完成前被不当处置。  
  **English Explanation**: Escrowed Shares refer to shares held temporarily by a third-party escrow agent during specific transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations, or initial public offerings (IPOs). These shares are typically provided by company shareholders or management as collateral to ensure the completion of the transaction or the fulfillment of specific conditions. The core concept of escrowed shares lies in the use of a third-party escrow mechanism to ensure fairness and security in the transaction, preventing improper handling of the shares before the transaction is finalized.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：托管股份常见于企业并购、IPO、股权激励计划等场景。例如，在公司并购中，买方可能要求卖方将部分股份托管，以确保交易完成后卖方履行承诺。在IPO中，创始股东或管理层可能被要求托管部分股份，以稳定股价并防止短期内大量抛售。需要注意的是，托管股份的使用需遵循相关法律法规，避免因托管条款不明确或托管机构选择不当而引发纠纷。  
  **English Application**: Escrowed shares are commonly used in scenarios such as mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, and equity incentive plans. For example, in a merger, the buyer may require the seller to place a portion of the shares in escrow to ensure the seller fulfills their commitments after the transaction is completed. In an IPO, founding shareholders or management may be required to escrow a portion of their shares to stabilize the stock price and prevent large-scale sell-offs in the short term. It is important to note that the use of escrowed shares must comply with relevant laws and regulations to avoid disputes arising from unclear escrow terms or improper selection of escrow agents.

  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, escrowed shares help maintain market order and prevent insider trading and market manipulation.

  **中文起源**：托管股份的概念最早可追溯至20世纪初的美国资本市场。当时，随着企业并购活动的增加，交易双方对交易安全性的需求日益增长。1929年股市崩盘后，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）加强了对资本市场的监管，托管股份作为一种保障交易安全的机制逐渐被广泛应用。20世纪80年代，随着全球并购浪潮的兴起，托管股份机制进一步成熟，并在全球范围内得到推广。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of escrowed shares can be traced back to the early 20th century in the U.S. capital markets. At that time, as corporate mergers and acquisitions increased, the need for transaction security grew among parties involved. After the stock market crash of 1929, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strengthened its regulation of capital markets, and escrowed shares gradually became a widely used mechanism to ensure transaction security. In the 1980s, with the rise of global merger waves, the escrowed shares mechanism further matured and was adopted worldwide.
