# Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    员工持股计划（Employee Stock Purchase Plan, ESPP）是一种公司为员工提供的福利计划，允许员工以折扣价购买公司股票。通常，员工通过工资扣除的方式积累资金，在特定时间段内以低于市场价的价格购买公司股票。这一计划旨在激励员工与公司共同成长，增强员工的归属感和忠诚度。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    An Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a company-sponsored benefit program that allows employees to purchase company stock at a discounted price. Typically, employees contribute a portion of their salary to the plan, which is then used to buy company shares at a price lower than the market value during a specified period. The plan is designed to incentivize employees to grow with the company and enhance their sense of belonging and loyalty.

  - **English Application Scenarios**  
    ESPPs are widely used in publicly traded companies, particularly in the technology and financial sectors. Employees can acquire company shares at a lower cost and benefit from the company's growth. However, ESPPs also carry risks, such as potential losses due to stock price fluctuations. Employees should also be aware of tax implications, as ESPP gains may be considered taxable income.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文历史背景**  
    ESPP的起源可以追溯到20世纪初的美国，当时一些公司开始尝试通过员工持股来增强员工的归属感。20世纪50年代，随着《美国税法》的修订，ESPP逐渐成为一种正式的福利计划。1974年，《员工退休收入保障法》（ERISA）的出台进一步规范了ESPP的实施。  
  - **English Historical Background**  
    The origins of ESPPs can be traced back to the early 20th century in the United States, when some companies began experimenting with employee stock ownership to enhance employee loyalty. In the 1950s, with revisions to the U.S. tax code, ESPPs gradually became a formal benefit program. The enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974 further standardized the implementation of ESPPs.
