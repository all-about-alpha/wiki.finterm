# Economic Exposure

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：经济暴露（Economic Exposure），也称为经营暴露或经营风险，是指由于汇率波动导致企业未来现金流、盈利能力或市场价值发生变化的风险。这一概念由国际金融学者在20世纪70年代提出，核心在于企业跨国经营时，汇率变动对其长期经营成果的影响。  
  **English Explanation**: Economic Exposure, also known as Operating Exposure, refers to the risk that a company's future cash flows, profitability, or market value may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. This concept was introduced by international finance scholars in the 1970s, focusing on the impact of exchange rate changes on a company's long-term operational performance in cross-border operations.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：经济暴露主要应用于跨国企业的财务管理中。例如，一家出口企业若以美元结算，当本币升值时，其收入可能减少；反之，若本币贬值，则收入增加。企业可通过套期保值、调整定价策略或分散市场来管理此类风险。需要注意的是，经济暴露的影响是长期的，且难以完全规避。  
  **English Explanation**: Economic Exposure is primarily applied in the financial management of multinational corporations. For example, if an export-oriented company settles transactions in US dollars, a strengthening of its domestic currency may reduce its revenue, while a weakening may increase it. Companies can manage this risk through hedging, adjusting pricing strategies, or diversifying markets. It is important to note that the impact of Economic Exposure is long-term and difficult to completely mitigate.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**：从监管角度看，经济暴露是跨国企业风险管理的重要组成部分；从投资角度看，它影响企业的估值和投资回报；从行业角度看，汇率波动可能改变行业竞争格局。因此，理解和管理经济暴露对企业的可持续发展至关重要。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, Economic Exposure is a critical component of risk management for multinational corporations. From an investment standpoint, it affects a company's valuation and return on investment. From an industry perspective, exchange rate fluctuations can alter competitive dynamics. Therefore, understanding and managing Economic Exposure is essential for a company's sustainable development.
