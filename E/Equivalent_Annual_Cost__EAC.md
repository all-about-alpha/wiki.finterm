# Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：等效年成本（Equivalent Annual Cost, EAC）是一种用于比较不同投资项目或设备选择的经济分析方法。它将项目的总成本（包括初始投资和运营成本）转换为一个等值的年度成本，以便在相同的时间框架内进行比较。EAC的核心概念是通过折现现金流（DCF）方法，将不同期限或不同规模的项目成本标准化为年度成本，从而简化决策过程。  
  - **English Explanation**: Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is an economic analysis method used to compare different investment projects or equipment choices. It converts the total cost of a project (including initial investment and operating costs) into an equivalent annual cost, enabling comparisons within the same time frame. The core concept of EAC is to standardize costs of projects with different durations or scales into annual costs using discounted cash flow (DCF) methods, thereby simplifying decision-making.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：EAC常用于资本预算决策中，特别是在选择设备更新、租赁或购买决策时。例如，企业在选择购买新设备或继续使用旧设备时，可以通过计算EAC来比较两者的年度成本，从而选择更经济的方案。需要注意的是，EAC的计算依赖于折现率的选择，折现率的准确性直接影响结果的可靠性。  
  - **English Application**: EAC is commonly used in capital budgeting decisions, particularly when choosing between equipment upgrades, leasing, or purchasing options. For example, when a company decides whether to buy new equipment or continue using old equipment, it can compare the annual costs by calculating the EAC to select the more economical option. It is important to note that the accuracy of EAC calculations depends on the choice of the discount rate, which directly affects the reliability of the results.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  - **中文重要性**：从投资和行业角度来看，EAC提供了一种标准化的成本比较方法，帮助企业在复杂的资本预算决策中做出更理性的选择。它尤其适用于不同期限或不同规模的项目比较，避免了直接比较总成本的局限性。此外，EAC在财务管理和工程经济学中具有重要地位，是评估长期投资项目的关键工具之一。  
  - **English Significance**: From an investment and industry perspective, EAC provides a standardized method for cost comparison, helping companies make more rational decisions in complex capital budgeting scenarios. It is particularly useful for comparing projects with different durations or scales, avoiding the limitations of directly comparing total costs. Additionally, EAC holds significant importance in financial management and engineering economics, serving as a key tool for evaluating long-term investment projects.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**：EAC的概念起源于20世纪中期的资本预算理论和工程经济学领域。随着折现现金流（DCF）方法的普及，经济学家和工程师开始探索如何将不同期限的项目成本标准化。EAC作为一种简化工具，逐渐被广泛应用于企业财务管理和项目评估中。其发展过程中，多位经济学家和财务专家对其理论框架进行了完善。  
  - **English Origin**: The concept of EAC originated in the mid-20th century within the fields of capital budgeting theory and engineering economics. With the widespread adoption of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods, economists and engineers began exploring ways to standardize the costs of projects with different durations. EAC emerged as a simplification tool and gradually gained widespread use in corporate financial management and project evaluation. Over time, numerous economists and financial experts refined its theoretical framework.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  - **中文影响**：EAC的提出和应用对资本预算决策产生了深远影响。它不仅提高了企业资源配置的效率，还为跨行业、跨项目的成本比较提供了科学依据。如今，EAC已成为工程经济学和财务管理课程中的核心内容，并在全球范围内被广泛应用于能源、制造、交通等行业的投资决策中。  
  - **English Impact**: The introduction and application of EAC have had a profound impact on capital budgeting decisions. It has not only improved the efficiency of resource allocation for companies but also provided a scientific basis for cost comparisons across industries and projects. Today, EAC is a core topic in engineering economics and financial management courses and is widely used globally in investment decisions across industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation.
