# Economic Value of Equity (EVE)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  经济权益价值（Economic Value of Equity, EVE）是衡量银行或其他金融机构在市场利率变动时，其股东权益经济价值变化的指标。它反映了金融机构在利率波动下的长期偿付能力和资本充足性。EVE的核心概念是通过对资产和负债的现值进行重新估值，计算利率变动对净现值的影响。这一概念最早由银行业监管机构引入，用于评估利率风险对金融机构的潜在影响。  

  **English Explanation**  
  The Economic Value of Equity (EVE) is a metric used to measure the change in the economic value of a bank's or financial institution's equity due to fluctuations in market interest rates. It reflects the long-term solvency and capital adequacy of financial institutions under interest rate volatility. The core concept of EVE involves revaluing the present value of assets and liabilities to calculate the impact of interest rate changes on net present value. This concept was initially introduced by banking regulators to assess the potential impact of interest rate risk on financial institutions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  EVE主要用于银行和金融机构的利率风险管理。通过模拟不同利率情景下的资产和负债现值变化，金融机构可以评估其资本结构的稳定性。例如，在利率上升时，固定利率负债的现值下降，而浮动利率资产的现值可能上升，从而影响净权益价值。应用EVE时需注意模型假设的局限性，如利率曲线的形状变化和资产负债表的动态调整。  

  **English Application**  
  EVE is primarily used for interest rate risk management in banks and financial institutions. By simulating changes in the present value of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios, institutions can assess the stability of their capital structure. For example, when interest rates rise, the present value of fixed-rate liabilities decreases, while the present value of floating-rate assets may increase, thereby affecting net equity value. When applying EVE, it is important to consider the limitations of model assumptions, such as changes in the shape of the yield curve and dynamic adjustments to the balance sheet.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，EVE是评估银行利率风险的重要工具，帮助监管机构确保金融机构在利率波动下的稳健性。从投资角度看，EVE为投资者提供了评估银行长期偿付能力的指标。从行业角度看，EVE的应用推动了金融机构对资产负债管理的精细化，提升了整体风险管理水平。  

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, EVE is a critical tool for assessing banks' interest rate risk, helping regulators ensure the stability of financial institutions under interest rate fluctuations. From an investment perspective, EVE provides investors with a metric to evaluate the long-term solvency of banks. From an industry perspective, the application of EVE has driven the refinement of asset-liability management in financial institutions, enhancing overall risk management capabilities.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  EVE的概念起源于20世纪80年代，当时全球金融市场经历了剧烈的利率波动，导致许多银行面临严重的利率风险。为应对这一问题，银行业监管机构开始引入EVE作为衡量利率风险的工具。1996年，巴塞尔委员会在《利率风险管理原则》中正式将EVE纳入监管框架，标志着其在全球范围内的广泛应用。  

  **English Origin**  
  The concept of EVE originated in the 1980s when global financial markets experienced significant interest rate volatility, leading many banks to face severe interest rate risks. To address this issue, banking regulators began introducing EVE as a tool to measure interest rate risk. In 1996, the Basel Committee formally incorporated EVE into the regulatory framework in its "Principles for the Management of Interest Rate Risk," marking its widespread adoption globally.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  EVE的引入对银行业产生了深远影响。它不仅帮助银行更好地管理利率风险，还推动了资产负债管理技术的发展。如今，EVE已成为全球银行业监管的重要指标之一，广泛应用于压力测试和资本规划中。在中国，EVE也被纳入商业银行的利率风险管理框架，成为评估银行稳健性的关键工具。  

  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of EVE has had a profound impact on the banking industry. It has not only helped banks better manage interest rate risk but also driven the development of asset-liability management techniques. Today, EVE is one of the key metrics in global banking regulation, widely used in stress testing and capital planning. In China, EVE has also been incorporated into the interest rate risk management framework of commercial banks, becoming a critical tool for assessing bank stability.
