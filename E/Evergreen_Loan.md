# Evergreen Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：常青贷款（Evergreen Loan）是一种特殊类型的贷款，其特点是在贷款到期时，借款人无需偿还本金，而是通过自动续期的方式延长贷款期限。这种贷款通常用于满足企业长期资金需求，常见于中小企业融资或项目融资中。核心概念在于“常青”，即贷款期限可以无限延长，只要借款人和贷款机构达成一致。  
  **English Explanation**: An Evergreen Loan is a special type of loan where the borrower is not required to repay the principal at maturity. Instead, the loan is automatically renewed, extending its term. This type of loan is typically used to meet long-term funding needs, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or project financing. The core concept lies in its "evergreen" nature, meaning the loan term can be extended indefinitely as long as both the borrower and lender agree.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：常青贷款常用于中小企业融资，尤其是那些需要长期资金支持但短期内无法偿还本金的企业。此外，它也适用于项目融资，如基础设施建设或房地产开发。需要注意的是，由于贷款期限的灵活性，借款人可能面临较高的利率或额外的续期费用，且贷款机构需定期评估借款人的信用状况。  
  **English Application**: Evergreen Loans are commonly used in SME financing, particularly for businesses that require long-term funding but cannot repay the principal in the short term. They are also suitable for project financing, such as infrastructure development or real estate projects. It is important to note that due to the flexibility of the loan term, borrowers may face higher interest rates or additional renewal fees, and lenders must regularly assess the borrower's creditworthiness.

  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Evergreen Loans provide SMEs with flexible financing options, helping to alleviate their funding pressures. From an investment perspective, they offer long-term, stable returns for investors.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：常青贷款的概念最早起源于20世纪80年代的美国，当时中小企业融资需求激增，传统贷款模式无法满足其长期资金需求。金融机构开始设计这种无需偿还本金的贷款产品，以支持企业的持续发展。随着时间的推移，常青贷款逐渐在全球范围内得到应用，尤其是在新兴市场。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of Evergreen Loans originated in the United States in the 1980s, when the financing needs of SMEs surged, and traditional loan models could not meet their long-term funding requirements. Financial institutions began designing loan products that did not require principal repayment to support continuous business growth. Over time, Evergreen Loans gained global traction, particularly in emerging markets.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：常青贷款对中小企业融资产生了深远影响，为其提供了更灵活的融资选择。然而，由于其长期性和灵活性，贷款机构需要加强风险管理，避免潜在的信用风险。目前，常青贷款在亚洲和欧洲的部分国家得到了广泛应用，成为中小企业融资的重要工具之一。  
  **English Impact**: Evergreen Loans have had a profound impact on SME financing, offering more flexible funding options. However, due to their long-term and flexible nature, lenders need to strengthen risk management to avoid potential credit risks.
