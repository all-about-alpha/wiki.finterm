# Explicit Cost

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：显性成本（Explicit Cost）是指企业在生产经营过程中实际发生的、可以直接用货币计量的成本。这些成本通常包括原材料费用、工资、租金、利息等，是企业财务报表中明确记录的费用。显性成本的概念最早由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）提出，用于区分实际支出与隐性成本（如机会成本）。  
  **English Explanation**: Explicit costs are the direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by a business in its operations, which can be easily quantified in monetary terms. These costs typically include expenses such as raw materials, wages, rent, and interest payments, and are explicitly recorded in a company's financial statements. The concept of explicit costs was introduced by economist Alfred Marshall to distinguish actual expenditures from implicit costs (such as opportunity costs).

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：显性成本广泛应用于企业的成本核算、预算编制和财务分析中。例如，在制造业中，原材料采购费用和生产设备折旧费用是典型的显性成本；在服务业中，员工工资和办公场地租金也是显性成本的重要组成部分。需要注意的是，显性成本虽然易于量化，但企业在决策时还需考虑隐性成本，以避免片面性。  
  **English Application**: Explicit costs are widely used in cost accounting, budgeting, and financial analysis. For instance, in manufacturing, the cost of raw materials and depreciation of production equipment are typical explicit costs; in the service industry, employee salaries and office rent are also significant explicit costs. It is important to note that while explicit costs are easily quantifiable, businesses must also consider implicit costs in decision-making to avoid a one-sided perspective.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，显性成本是企业纳税和财务透明度的基础；从投资角度看，显性成本直接影响企业的盈利能力和估值；从行业角度看，显性成本的优化是企业提升竞争力的关键。例如，通过降低原材料采购成本或提高生产效率，企业可以显著改善利润率。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, explicit costs form the basis for taxation and financial transparency. From an investment standpoint, explicit costs directly impact a company's profitability and valuation. From an industry perspective, optimizing explicit costs is crucial for enhancing competitiveness. For example, reducing raw material procurement costs or improving production efficiency can significantly boost profit margins.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：显性成本的概念最早可追溯至19世纪末，由英国经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔在其著作《经济学原理》（1890年）中提出。马歇尔通过区分显性成本和隐性成本，为现代成本分析奠定了基础。这一概念的提出是为了更准确地衡量企业的实际支出，从而为经济决策提供科学依据。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of explicit costs dates back to the late 19th century, introduced by British economist Alfred Marshall in his seminal work *Principles of Economics* (1890). Marshall's distinction between explicit and implicit costs laid the foundation for modern cost analysis. This concept was developed to provide a more accurate measure of a business's actual expenditures, thereby offering a scientific basis for economic decision-making.
