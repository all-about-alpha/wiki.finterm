# Economic Profit (or Loss)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  经济利润（或亏损）是指企业在扣除所有显性成本和隐性成本后所获得的剩余收益。显性成本包括直接支付的费用，如工资、租金和材料成本；隐性成本则包括机会成本，即企业因选择某一投资而放弃的其他投资机会的潜在收益。经济利润的核心概念在于它不仅考虑了会计利润，还考虑了资源的最佳替代用途。这一概念最早由经济学家阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔（Alfred Marshall）提出，用于衡量企业的真实盈利能力。  

  **English Explanation**  
  Economic profit (or loss) refers to the residual income earned by a firm after deducting all explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs include direct payments such as wages, rent, and material costs, while implicit costs include opportunity costs, which represent the potential returns from the next best alternative investment foregone. The core concept of economic profit lies in its consideration of not only accounting profit but also the optimal alternative use of resources. This concept was first introduced by economist Alfred Marshall to measure the true profitability of a firm.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  经济利润常用于企业战略决策和投资评估。例如，企业在决定是否进入新市场或开发新产品时，会计算经济利润以评估其长期可行性。此外，投资者也会使用经济利润来衡量企业的真实价值，而不仅仅是会计利润。需要注意的是，经济利润的计算依赖于对机会成本的合理估计，这可能因主观判断而存在偏差。  

  **English Application**  
  Economic profit is often used in strategic decision-making and investment evaluation. For instance, when a firm decides whether to enter a new market or develop a new product, it calculates economic profit to assess long-term viability. Additionally, investors use economic profit to gauge the true value of a firm, beyond just accounting profit. It is important to note that the calculation of economic profit relies on reasonable estimates of opportunity costs, which may be subject to subjective judgment and potential bias.

  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, economic profit helps identify a firm's true profitability and resource utilization efficiency, providing a basis for policy-making. From an investment perspective, economic profit more accurately reflects a firm's long-term value, aiding investors in making informed decisions.
