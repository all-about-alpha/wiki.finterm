# Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  预计最终采收量（Estimated Ultimate Recovery, EUR）是指在油气田开发过程中，预计从某一油气藏中最终可采出的油气总量。这一概念通常用于油气资源评估和开发规划，涵盖了技术可采量和经济可采量。EUR的计算基于地质数据、工程分析和经济条件，是油气田开发决策的重要依据。  
  **English Explanation**  
  Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) refers to the total volume of oil and gas that is expected to be ultimately recoverable from a hydrocarbon reservoir during its development. This concept is commonly used in resource assessment and development planning, encompassing both technically recoverable and economically viable reserves. EUR is calculated based on geological data, engineering analysis, and economic conditions, serving as a critical factor in decision-making for oil and gas field development.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  EUR广泛应用于油气田的开发规划、投资决策和储量评估。例如，在油气田开发初期，EUR用于评估项目的经济可行性；在生产阶段，EUR用于优化开采方案和提高采收率。需要注意的是，EUR的估算受技术、经济和地质条件的影响，可能存在不确定性。  
  **English Application Scenarios**  
  EUR is widely used in the development planning, investment decision-making, and reserve assessment of oil and gas fields. For instance, during the early stages of field development, EUR is used to evaluate the economic viability of a project; during production, it helps optimize extraction strategies and enhance recovery rates. It is important to note that EUR estimates are subject to uncertainties due to technical, economic, and geological factors.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，EUR是油气资源管理和储量报告的重要指标；从投资角度看，EUR直接影响项目的估值和融资能力；从行业角度看，EUR是衡量油气田开发潜力和技术水平的核心参数。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, EUR is a key metric for resource management and reserve reporting. From an investment standpoint, it directly impacts project valuation and financing capabilities. From an industry perspective, EUR serves as a core parameter for assessing the development potential and technological capabilities of oil and gas fields.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  EUR的概念起源于20世纪中叶，随着全球油气勘探开发的快速发展，资源评估的需求日益增加。早期的EUR估算主要依赖地质学家和工程师的经验判断，后来逐渐引入了数学模型和计算机技术，提高了估算的准确性。  
  **English Origin**  
  The concept of EUR emerged in the mid-20th century, driven by the rapid growth of global oil and gas exploration and the increasing need for resource assessment. Early EUR estimates relied heavily on the expertise of geologists and engineers, but over time, mathematical models and computer technologies were introduced to enhance accuracy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  EUR的引入极大地推动了油气行业的科学化和规范化发展。它不仅提高了资源评估的准确性，还为全球油气资源的合理开发和利用提供了重要依据。目前，EUR已成为国际油气公司和监管机构的标准评估工具。  
  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of EUR has significantly advanced the scientific and standardized development of the oil and gas industry. It has not only improved the accuracy of resource assessments but also provided a critical basis for the rational development and utilization of global hydrocarbon resources. Today, EUR is a standard evaluation tool for international oil and gas companies and regulatory bodies.
