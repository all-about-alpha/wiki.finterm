## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  **中文解释**：豁免员工（Exempt Employee）是指根据《公平劳动标准法》（FLSA）的规定，不受最低工资和加班费保护的员工类别。这类员工通常从事管理、行政、专业或外部销售等职位，且其薪资水平达到一定标准。豁免员工的核心概念在于其工作性质决定了他们不需要按小时计算工资，也不享有加班费。  
  **English Explanation**: An exempt employee refers to a category of workers who are not entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). These employees typically hold positions in management, administration, professional roles, or outside sales, and their salaries meet specific thresholds. The core concept of exempt employees lies in the nature of their work, which exempts them from hourly wage calculations and overtime pay.

It is crucial for businesses to strictly adhere to FLSA regulations to ensure that exempt employees' salaries and job responsibilities meet the required standards, or they may face legal risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，豁免员工的分类有助于明确劳动法的适用范围，保护非豁免员工的权益。从企业管理角度，豁免员工的设置可以提高管理效率，但也需要企业承担更高的薪资成本。从行业角度看，豁免员工的广泛存在反映了现代经济中知识型和服务型岗位的重要性。
