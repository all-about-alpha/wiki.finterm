## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：员工福利的起源可以追溯到19世纪末至20世纪初的工业革命时期。当时，工厂工人面临恶劣的工作环境和低工资，导致劳资矛盾激化。为了缓解这一问题，一些企业开始提供基本的医疗和住房福利。例如，美国福特汽车公司于1914年推出了“5美元日薪”计划，不仅提高了工资，还提供了利润分享和带薪休假，成为员工福利发展的里程碑。

For example, Ford Motor Company in the U.S. introduced the "$5 Day" program in 1914, which not only increased wages but also included profit-sharing and paid leave, marking a milestone in the development of employee benefits.
