  **中文解释**  
  教育IRA（Education IRA），也称为Coverdell教育储蓄账户（Coverdell Education Savings Account, ESA），是一种专门为支付教育费用而设立的税收优惠储蓄账户。它由美国国会于1997年创立，旨在帮助家庭为子女的教育费用（包括小学、中学和高等教育）进行储蓄。账户中的资金可以免税增长，并且在用于合格的教育费用时，提款也是免税的。  

  **English Explanation**  
  An Education IRA, also known as a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA), is a tax-advantaged savings account specifically designed to cover educational expenses. Established by the U.S. Congress in 1997, it aims to help families save for their children's education costs, including elementary, secondary, and higher education. Funds in the account grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free when used for qualified educational expenses.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  教育IRA主要用于支付合格的教育费用，包括学费、书本费、住宿费以及其他与教育相关的开支。账户持有人可以为未满18岁的受益人开设账户，并每年存入一定金额（目前上限为2000美元）。需要注意的是，如果资金未用于合格的教育费用，提款可能会面临税收和罚款。此外，账户资金必须在受益人年满30岁之前使用完毕，否则将面临税务处罚。  

  **English Application Scenarios**  
  The Education IRA is primarily used to cover qualified educational expenses, including tuition, books, room and board, and other education-related costs. Account holders can open an account for a beneficiary under the age of 18 and contribute up to a certain amount annually (currently $2,000). It is important to note that if funds are not used for qualified educational expenses, withdrawals may be subject to taxes and penalties. Additionally, the account funds must be used before the beneficiary turns 30, or they may face tax penalties.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  教育IRA的前身是1997年由美国国会通过的《纳税人救济法案》（Taxpayer Relief Act）中引入的“教育IRA”。2001年，该账户被更名为“Coverdell教育储蓄账户”，以纪念已故参议员保罗·科弗德尔（Paul Coverdell），他长期致力于教育改革和储蓄计划的推广。Coverdell ESA的设立旨在为美国家庭提供更多的教育储蓄选择，特别是在高等教育费用不断上涨的背景下。  

  **English Origin**  
  The Education IRA was originally introduced as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. In 2001, it was renamed the "Coverdell Education Savings Account" in honor of the late Senator Paul Coverdell, who was a strong advocate for education reform and savings plans. The establishment of the Coverdell ESA aimed to provide American families with more options for saving for education, especially in the context of rising higher education costs.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  教育IRA的推出对美国家庭的教育储蓄行为产生了深远影响。它为中等收入家庭提供了一种灵活的教育储蓄工具，帮助他们更好地规划子女的教育费用。然而，由于每年存入金额的限制（2000美元），教育IRA在应对高昂的大学费用方面仍显不足。因此，许多家庭选择将其与其他教育储蓄工具（如529计划）结合使用。  

  **English Impact**  
  The introduction of the Education IRA has had a profound impact on American families' education savings behavior. It provides a flexible savings tool for middle-income families, helping them better plan for their children's educational expenses. However, due to the annual contribution limit of $2,000, the Education IRA is often insufficient to cover the high costs of college. As a result, many families choose to use it in conjunction with other education savings tools, such as 529 plans.
