# Expansionary Policy

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **扩张性政策** 是一种宏观经济政策，旨在通过增加货币供应量或增加政府支出来刺激经济增长。这种政策通常在经济衰退或增长缓慢时使用，以增加就业、提高消费和投资水平。核心概念包括财政扩张（如减税、增加政府支出）和货币扩张（如降低利率、增加货币供应）。  
  **Expansionary Policy** is a macroeconomic policy aimed at stimulating economic growth by increasing the money supply or government spending. This policy is typically used during economic recessions or periods of slow growth to boost employment, consumption, and investment levels. Key concepts include fiscal expansion (e.g., tax cuts, increased government spending) and monetary expansion (e.g., lowering interest rates, increasing money supply).

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，扩张性政策常用于应对经济下行压力，例如2008年全球金融危机期间推出的“四万亿”经济刺激计划。这种政策通过增加基础设施投资和减税来提振经济，但也可能带来通货膨胀、债务累积等风险。  
  In China, expansionary policies are often used to counter economic downturns, such as the "Four Trillion" stimulus package introduced during the 2008 global financial crisis. These policies boost the economy through increased infrastructure investment and tax cuts but may also lead to risks like inflation and debt accumulation.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，扩张性政策是政府调控经济的重要工具，能够有效缓解经济衰退的影响。从投资和行业角度看，这种政策通常带来市场流动性增加和投资机会增多，但也需要警惕过度刺激带来的副作用。  
  From a regulatory perspective, expansionary policies are crucial tools for governments to manage economic downturns. From an investment and industry perspective, these policies often increase market liquidity and create investment opportunities, but caution is needed to avoid the side effects of overstimulation.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  扩张性政策的概念起源于20世纪30年代的大萧条时期，由经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯提出。凯恩斯主张在经济衰退时，政府应通过增加支出和减税来刺激需求，从而恢复经济增长。这一理论成为现代宏观经济政策的基石。  
  The concept of expansionary policy originated during the Great Depression of the 1930s, proposed by economist John Maynard Keynes. Keynes argued that during economic downturns, governments should stimulate demand through increased spending and tax cuts to restore economic growth. This theory became a cornerstone of modern macroeconomic policy.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  扩张性政策在全球范围内被广泛应用，例如2008年金融危机后，许多国家实施了大规模的经济刺激计划。在中国，这种政策帮助维持了较高的经济增长率，但也导致了地方政府债务增加和部分行业产能过剩的问题。  
  Expansionary policies have been widely adopted globally, such as the large-scale stimulus packages implemented by many countries after the 2008 financial crisis. In China, these policies have helped maintain high economic growth rates but have also led to increased local government debt and overcapacity in certain industries.
