# Ex-Date

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：除息日（Ex-Date）是指股票交易中，投资者购买股票后不再享有本次股息分配权的起始日期。在这一天或之后购买股票的投资者将无法获得公司即将派发的股息。除息日的设定是为了确保股息的分配公平，避免在股息发放前夕出现投机行为。  
  **English Explanation**: The ex-date (short for "ex-dividend date") is the date on which a stock begins trading without the value of its next dividend payment. Investors who purchase the stock on or after this date are not entitled to receive the upcoming dividend. The ex-date is established to ensure fair distribution of dividends and to prevent speculative trading just before the dividend is paid.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：除息日广泛应用于股票市场，特别是在股息分配期间。投资者需要关注除息日，以确定是否能够获得股息。例如，如果投资者在除息日前一天买入股票并持有至除息日，他们将有权获得股息；如果在除息日当天或之后买入，则无法获得。需要注意的是，除息日通常会导致股价在当天出现调整，因为股息的价值已被扣除。  
  **English Application**: The ex-date is widely used in stock markets, particularly during dividend distribution periods. Investors must pay attention to the ex-date to determine their eligibility for dividends. For example, if an investor buys a stock before the ex-date and holds it through the ex-date, they are entitled to the dividend. However, if they buy on or after the ex-date, they will not receive the dividend. It is important to note that the stock price typically adjusts downward on the ex-date to reflect the dividend payout.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：除息日在金融市场中具有重要意义。从监管角度看，除息日的设定确保了股息分配的透明性和公平性。从投资角度看，除息日是投资者制定股息策略的关键时间点。对于行业而言，除息日的存在有助于维护市场秩序，减少投机行为。  
  **English Significance**: The ex-date holds significant importance in financial markets. From a regulatory perspective, it ensures transparency and fairness in dividend distribution. For investors, the ex-date is a critical timing factor in dividend-related strategies. For the industry, the ex-date helps maintain market order and reduces speculative activities.
