# EBITDAR

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  EBITDAR 是“息税折旧摊销及租金前利润”（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent）的缩写。它是一个衡量企业核心经营绩效的财务指标，特别适用于租赁成本较高的行业，如航空、酒店和零售业。EBITDAR 通过排除利息、税项、折旧、摊销和租金等非经营性支出，帮助企业更清晰地评估其经营效率。  
  EBITDAR stands for "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent." It is a financial metric used to measure a company's core operating performance, particularly in industries with significant leasing costs, such as airlines, hospitality, and retail. By excluding non-operating expenses like interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent, EBITDAR provides a clearer view of a company's operational efficiency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  EBITDAR 常用于评估租赁密集型企业的经营表现，例如航空公司、酒店集团和零售连锁店。在这些行业中，租金支出占比较高，EBITDAR 能够更准确地反映企业的实际盈利能力。需要注意的是，EBITDAR 并非会计准则规定的标准指标，因此在使用时应结合其他财务指标进行综合分析，以避免误导性结论。  
  EBITDAR is commonly used to evaluate the operating performance of lease-intensive businesses, such as airlines, hotel chains, and retail stores. In these industries, rental expenses constitute a significant portion of costs, and EBITDAR provides a more accurate reflection of actual profitability. It is important to note that EBITDAR is not a standardized metric under accounting principles, so it should be used in conjunction with other financial indicators to avoid misleading conclusions.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和投资角度来看，EBITDAR 是评估企业偿债能力和经营效率的重要工具，尤其适用于高杠杆或租赁密集型行业。它帮助投资者和债权人更好地理解企业的现金流生成能力。从行业角度来看，EBITDAR 为管理层提供了优化经营策略的参考依据，特别是在租金成本管理方面。  
  From a regulatory and investment perspective, EBITDAR is a crucial tool for assessing a company's debt-servicing capability and operational efficiency, especially in highly leveraged or lease-intensive industries. It helps investors and creditors better understand a company's cash flow generation capacity. From an industry perspective, EBITDAR provides management with insights for optimizing operational strategies, particularly in managing rental costs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  EBITDAR 的概念起源于 20 世纪 80 年代，随着租赁业务的普及和资本密集型行业的快速发展，传统的 EBITDA 指标无法充分反映企业的租金负担。因此，分析师和投资者开始引入 EBITDAR，以更全面地评估企业的经营表现。这一指标在航空业和酒店业中得到了广泛应用，因为这些行业的租金支出占据了运营成本的很大一部分。  
  The concept of EBITDAR emerged in the 1980s as leasing became more prevalent and capital-intensive industries grew rapidly. Traditional EBITDA metrics were insufficient to capture the rental burden of companies, leading analysts and investors to adopt EBITDAR for a more comprehensive evaluation of operational performance. This metric gained widespread use in industries like aviation and hospitality, where rental expenses constitute a significant portion of operating costs.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  EBITDAR 的引入对租赁密集型行业的财务分析产生了深远影响。它帮助投资者和债权人更准确地评估企业的偿债能力和现金流状况，同时也为企业管理层提供了优化租金成本管理的工具。如今，EBITDAR 已成为全球范围内评估高租赁成本企业的重要指标之一。  
  The introduction of EBITDAR has had a profound impact on financial analysis in lease-intensive industries. It has enabled investors and creditors to more accurately assess a company's debt-servicing capacity and cash flow situation, while also providing management with tools to optimize rental cost management. Today, EBITDAR is one of the key metrics used globally to evaluate companies with high leasing costs.
