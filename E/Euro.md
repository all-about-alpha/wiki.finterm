    欧元广泛应用于欧元区国家的日常交易、国际贸易结算以及金融市场投资。欧元区的企业和个人使用欧元进行支付、储蓄和借贷。在国际贸易中，欧元是仅次于美元的全球第二大储备货币。需要注意的是，欧元区的货币政策由欧洲中央银行统一制定，成员国无法独立调整利率或货币供应量，这可能在某些经济危机中带来风险。

Businesses and individuals in the Eurozone use the Euro for payments, savings, and loans. In international trade, the Euro is the second-largest global reserve currency after the US dollar.
