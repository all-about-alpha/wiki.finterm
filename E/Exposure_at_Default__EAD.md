# Exposure at Default (EAD)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**  
    违约风险暴露（Exposure at Default, EAD）是指在借款人违约时，银行或金融机构可能面临的风险敞口金额。它是信用风险管理中的一个关键指标，用于衡量在违约事件发生时，金融机构可能遭受的潜在损失。EAD通常包括未偿还的贷款本金、利息以及可能的其他费用。  
  - **English Explanation**  
    Exposure at Default (EAD) refers to the amount of risk exposure that a bank or financial institution may face at the time of a borrower's default. It is a critical metric in credit risk management, used to measure the potential loss that a financial institution may incur in the event of a default. EAD typically includes the outstanding loan principal, interest, and possibly other fees.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**  
    EAD广泛应用于银行和金融机构的信用风险管理中，特别是在计算资本要求和信用风险模型（如内部评级法IRB）时。它帮助机构评估在借款人违约时的潜在损失，从而制定相应的风险缓释策略。需要注意的是，EAD的估算需要考虑借款人的还款行为、贷款类型以及市场条件等因素。  
  - **English Application**  
    EAD is widely used in credit risk management by banks and financial institutions, particularly in calculating capital requirements and credit risk models (such as the Internal Ratings-Based Approach, IRB). It helps institutions assess potential losses in the event of a borrower's default, thereby formulating appropriate risk mitigation strategies. It is important to note that estimating EAD requires consideration of the borrower's repayment behavior, loan type, and market conditions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  - **中文起源**  
    EAD的概念起源于20世纪80年代末至90年代初，随着全球金融市场的复杂化和信用风险的增加，金融机构开始需要更精确的工具来量化信用风险。巴塞尔协议的推出进一步推动了EAD的应用，特别是在2004年巴塞尔II协议中，EAD被正式纳入信用风险资本计算框架。  
  - **English Origin**  
    The concept of EAD originated in the late 1980s to early 1990s, as global financial markets became more complex and credit risks increased, prompting financial institutions to seek more precise tools for quantifying credit risk. The introduction of the Basel Accords further propelled the application of EAD, particularly with the Basel II Accord in 2004, which formally incorporated EAD into the credit risk capital calculation framework.
