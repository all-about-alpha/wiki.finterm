# Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  - **中文解释**：EBITDA（息税折旧摊销前利润）是一种衡量公司经营绩效的财务指标，表示公司在扣除利息、税项、折旧和摊销之前的利润。它由美国投资银行家约翰·马龙（John Malone）在20世纪80年代提出，核心概念是排除资本结构、税收政策和会计政策的影响，专注于企业的核心经营能力。  
  - **English Explanation**: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's operating performance. It represents the company's earnings before deducting interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The concept was introduced by American investment banker John Malone in the 1980s, with the core idea of excluding the effects of capital structure, tax policies, and accounting policies to focus on the company's core operational efficiency.

* **应用 / Application**  
  - **中文应用场景**：EBITDA常用于评估企业的经营现金流和盈利能力，尤其适用于资本密集型行业（如电信、能源）和高负债企业。它也被用于企业估值和并购交易中。需要注意的是，EBITDA忽略了资本支出和营运资金需求，可能高估企业的实际现金流。

It is also used in business valuation and M&A transactions. However, EBITDA ignores capital expenditures and working capital requirements, which may overestimate the company's actual cash flow.
