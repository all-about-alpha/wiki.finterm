## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  经济制裁的历史可以追溯到古希腊时期，当时雅典对麦加拉的贸易禁令被视为早期经济制裁的雏形。现代经济制裁的广泛应用始于20世纪，特别是第一次世界大战后，国际联盟对意大利的制裁标志着现代经济制裁体系的形成。  
  **English Origin**  
  The history of economic sanctions dates back to ancient Greece, where the trade embargo imposed by Athens on Megara is considered an early form of economic sanctions. The widespread use of modern economic sanctions began in the 20th century, particularly after World War I, with the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy marking the formation of the modern economic sanctions system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  经济制裁对目标国的经济、社会和政治产生深远影响。例如，对伊朗的制裁导致其石油出口大幅下降，经济陷入困境。然而，制裁也可能促使目标国寻求自给自足或与其他国家建立新的经济联盟。  
  **English Impact**  
  Economic sanctions have profound effects on the economy, society, and politics of the target country. For example, sanctions against Iran have significantly reduced its oil exports and plunged its economy into crisis. However, sanctions may also prompt the target country to seek self-sufficiency or form new economic alliances with other nations.
