## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：股权互换（Equity Swap）是一种金融衍生工具，由交易双方约定在未来某一时间段内，按照约定的条件交换与股权相关的现金流。通常，一方支付基于股票或股票指数的收益，另一方支付基于固定利率或浮动利率的收益。股权互换的核心在于通过互换现金流，实现风险对冲、收益优化或资产配置调整。  
  **English Explanation**: An equity swap is a financial derivative in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows related to equity performance over a specified period. Typically, one party pays returns based on a stock or stock index, while the other pays returns based on a fixed or floating interest rate. The core concept of an equity swap lies in exchanging cash flows to achieve risk hedging, return optimization, or asset allocation adjustments.
