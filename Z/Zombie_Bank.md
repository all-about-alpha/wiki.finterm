# Zombie Bank

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **僵尸银行**是指那些因资产质量严重恶化、资本金不足而无法正常运营，但由于政府或监管机构的支持而得以继续存在的银行。这类银行通常依赖外部资金注入或政策扶持来维持生存，但其实际经营能力已严重受损。  
  A **zombie bank** refers to a financial institution that is unable to operate normally due to severely deteriorated asset quality and insufficient capital but continues to exist with the support of the government or regulatory authorities. Such banks typically rely on external funding or policy support to survive, but their actual operational capacity is severely impaired.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，僵尸银行通常出现在经济下行周期或金融危机期间，如2008年全球金融危机后，部分中小银行因不良贷款激增而陷入困境。监管机构可能通过注资、债务重组或合并等方式维持其运营，但这可能导致资源错配和金融风险积累。  
  In China, zombie banks often emerge during economic downturns or financial crises, such as after the 2008 global financial crisis when some small and medium-sized banks faced difficulties due to a surge in non-performing loans. Regulatory authorities may maintain their operations through capital injections, debt restructuring, or mergers, but this can lead to resource misallocation and the accumulation of financial risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，僵尸银行的存在可能掩盖金融体系的真实健康状况，增加系统性风险；从投资角度看，这类银行的股票或债券可能具有高风险性；从行业角度看，僵尸银行的持续存在可能阻碍金融市场的优胜劣汰机制。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the existence of zombie banks may mask the true health of the financial system and increase systemic risks; from an investment perspective, stocks or bonds of such banks may be highly risky; from an industry perspective, the continued existence of zombie banks may hinder the market's mechanism for survival of the fittest.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  僵尸银行的概念最早由美国经济学家爱德华·凯恩（Edward Kane）在1980年代提出，用于描述储蓄和贷款危机中濒临破产但仍被政府支持的金融机构。这一现象在日本1990年代的“失落的十年”期间尤为突出，大量银行因房地产泡沫破裂而成为僵尸银行。  
  The concept of zombie banks was first proposed by American economist Edward Kane in the 1980s to describe financial institutions on the verge of bankruptcy but still supported by the government during the savings and loan crisis. This phenomenon was particularly prominent during Japan's "Lost Decade" in the 1990s, when many banks became zombies due to the collapse of the real estate bubble.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  僵尸银行的长期存在对金融体系和经济复苏产生负面影响。例如，日本的经济停滞部分归因于僵尸银行的持续存在阻碍了资源的重新分配和企业重组。在全球范围内，2008年金融危机后欧美国家也出现了类似现象，导致经济复苏缓慢。  
  The long-term existence of zombie banks has a negative impact on the financial system and economic recovery. For example, Japan's economic stagnation was partly attributed to zombie banks hindering resource reallocation and corporate restructuring. Globally, similar phenomena emerged in Europe and America after the 2008 financial crisis, leading to slow economic recovery.
