# Zero-Coupon Mortgage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 零息抵押贷款是一种特殊的抵押贷款形式，借款人在贷款期间无需支付利息或本金，而是在贷款到期时一次性偿还全部本金和累积的利息。这种贷款通常以折价发行，即借款人最初获得的贷款金额低于到期时应偿还的总金额。  
  **English Explanation**: A zero-coupon mortgage is a unique type of mortgage where the borrower does not make periodic interest or principal payments during the loan term. Instead, the borrower repays the entire principal and accumulated interest in a lump sum at the loan's maturity. This type of loan is typically issued at a discount, meaning the borrower receives a loan amount less than the total amount to be repaid at maturity.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 零息抵押贷款适用于那些预期未来有较大现金流但当前资金紧张的借款人，如房地产开发商或投资者。由于无需定期还款，借款人可以更好地管理现金流。然而，这种贷款的风险在于到期时需一次性偿还大额资金，若借款人无法按时还款，可能面临违约风险。  
  **English Explanation**: Zero-coupon mortgages are suitable for borrowers who anticipate significant future cash flows but currently face liquidity constraints, such as real estate developers or investors. Since there are no periodic payments, borrowers can better manage their cash flow. However, the risk lies in the need to repay a large sum at maturity; if the borrower cannot meet this obligation, they may face default risks.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文解释**: 从监管角度看，零息抵押贷款的复杂性要求更高的透明度和风险管理；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了一种高收益但高风险的选择；从行业角度看，这种产品丰富了金融市场的多样性，但也增加了系统性风险。  
  **English Explanation**: From a regulatory perspective, zero-coupon mortgages require greater transparency and risk management due to their complexity; from an investment standpoint, they offer high-yield but high-risk options; from an industry perspective, these products diversify financial markets but also increase systemic risks.
