  **中文解释**：零责任政策（Zero Liability Policy）是一种由金融机构（如银行或信用卡公司）提供的消费者保护措施，旨在免除持卡人在未经授权的交易中的财务责任。该政策的核心概念是，如果持卡人的账户因欺诈或盗刷而遭受损失，持卡人无需承担任何经济损失。  
  **English Explanation**: A Zero Liability Policy is a consumer protection measure offered by financial institutions (such as banks or credit card companies) that absolves cardholders from financial responsibility for unauthorized transactions.

When a cardholder identifies unauthorized transactions, they must promptly report them to the issuing institution, which will investigate and absolve the cardholder of liability under the policy.
