## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  Z-Score（Z分数）是由美国经济学家爱德华·阿尔特曼（Edward Altman）于1968年提出的一种财务分析工具，用于评估企业的破产风险。它通过将多个财务比率结合成一个综合分数，来衡量企业的财务健康状况。Z-Score的核心概念是通过统计方法将企业的财务数据标准化，从而预测其破产的可能性。  
  The Z-Score, developed by American economist Edward Altman in 1968, is a financial analysis tool used to assess the bankruptcy risk of a company. It combines multiple financial ratios into a single score to measure the financial health of a company. The core concept of the Z-Score is to standardize a company's financial data using statistical methods to predict its likelihood of bankruptcy.

* **应用 / Application**  
  Z-Score广泛应用于企业财务分析、信用评级和投资决策中。在中国，Z-Score常用于评估上市公司的财务稳定性，特别是在银行、证券和保险等金融行业。使用Z-Score时需注意，它主要适用于制造业企业，对于非制造业企业的适用性可能有限。此外，Z-Score的结果可能受到会计准则差异和经济环境变化的影响。

In China, it is commonly applied to assess the financial stability of listed companies, especially in industries such as banking, securities, and insurance. When using the Z-Score, it is important to note that it is primarily applicable to manufacturing companies and may have limited applicability to non-manufacturing firms. Additionally, the results of the Z-Score can be influenced by differences in accounting standards and changes in economic conditions.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  Z-Score的起源可以追溯到20世纪60年代，当时爱德华·阿尔特曼在纽约大学斯特恩商学院任教期间，通过对大量破产企业的财务数据进行分析，提出了这一模型。1968年，阿尔特曼发表了题为《财务比率、判别分析和公司破产预测》的论文，正式提出了Z-Score模型。该模型最初基于美国制造业企业的数据，后来逐渐扩展到其他行业和国家。  
  The origin of the Z-Score dates back to the 1960s when Edward Altman, while teaching at the Stern School of Business at New York University, developed the model by analyzing financial data from numerous bankrupt companies. In 1968, Altman published a paper titled "Financial Ratios, Discriminant Analysis, and the Prediction of Corporate Bankruptcy," formally introducing the Z-Score model. Initially based on data from U.S. manufacturing firms, the model was later extended to other industries and countries.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  Z-Score的提出对全球财务分析领域产生了深远影响。在中国，Z-Score被广泛应用于企业财务风险评估，特别是在2008年全球金融危机后，其重要性进一步凸显。目前，Z-Score已成为许多金融机构和投资者进行财务分析的标准工具之一。  
  The introduction of the Z-Score has had a profound impact on the field of financial analysis worldwide. In China, the Z-Score is widely used for corporate financial risk assessment, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, when its importance became even more pronounced.
