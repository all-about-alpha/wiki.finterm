# Zero-Volatility Spread (Z-spread)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **零波动利差（Z-spread）** 是一种衡量债券相对于无风险利率的额外收益的指标，表示在假设利率曲线不变的情况下，债券现金流折现后的收益率与国债收益率曲线之间的差额。它反映了债券的信用风险、流动性风险和其他风险溢价。  
  **The Zero-Volatility Spread (Z-spread)** is a measure of the additional yield a bond offers over the risk-free rate, representing the constant spread that, when added to the Treasury yield curve, equates the present value of the bond's cash flows to its market price. It reflects credit risk, liquidity risk, and other risk premiums associated with the bond.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中文语境中，Z-spread常用于评估公司债、抵押支持证券（MBS）等非国债类债券的风险和定价。投资者通过比较不同债券的Z-spread来判断其相对价值，同时需注意市场利率变动对Z-spread的影响。  
  In English contexts, Z-spread is commonly used to assess the risk and pricing of non-Treasury bonds such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Investors compare Z-spreads across bonds to determine relative value while being mindful of how changes in market interest rates may affect it.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管和投资角度看，Z-spread是衡量债券风险的重要工具，帮助投资者识别高收益但高风险的投资机会。在行业层面，它为金融机构提供了更精确的定价和风险管理手段。  
  From regulatory and investment perspectives, Z-spread is a crucial tool for assessing bond risk, helping investors identify high-yield but high-risk opportunities. At the industry level, it provides financial institutions with more precise pricing and risk management capabilities.
