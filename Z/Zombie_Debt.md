# Zombie Debt

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **僵尸债务**是指那些已经过期、被债权人放弃或被认为无法收回的债务，但后来被债务收购公司以极低的价格购买并试图重新追讨的债务。这类债务通常因法律时效或债务人财务状况不佳而被视为“死亡”，但通过债务收购公司的操作，它们“复活”并重新进入追讨流程。  
  **Zombie Debt** refers to debts that have expired, been abandoned by creditors, or are deemed uncollectible, but are later purchased at a very low price by debt collection agencies in an attempt to revive and collect them. These debts are often considered "dead" due to legal statutes of limitations or the debtor's poor financial condition, but through the actions of debt buyers, they "come back to life" and re-enter the collection process.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在中国，僵尸债务通常出现在个人信用卡逾期、小额贷款违约等场景中。一些不良资产处置公司会低价收购这些债务，并通过法律或非法律手段向债务人施压。需要注意的是，债务人应了解相关法律规定，避免因不了解时效问题而被迫偿还已过期的债务。  
  In China, zombie debt often arises in scenarios such as overdue credit card payments or defaults on small loans. Some distressed asset management companies purchase these debts at low prices and pressure debtors through legal or non-legal means. It is important for debtors to understand relevant legal regulations to avoid being forced to repay expired debts due to ignorance of statute limitations.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，僵尸债务的存在可能引发不公平的追债行为，损害消费者权益；从投资角度看，不良资产处置公司通过低价收购和高额追讨获利；从行业角度看，僵尸债务反映了金融市场的风险管理和法律漏洞问题。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the existence of zombie debt may lead to unfair debt collection practices and harm consumer rights. From an investment perspective, distressed asset management companies profit by purchasing these debts at low prices and aggressively collecting them. From an industry perspective, zombie debt highlights issues in risk management and legal loopholes in financial markets.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  僵尸债务的概念起源于20世纪90年代的美国，当时随着信用卡和消费贷款的普及，大量逾期债务被银行打包出售给第三方追债公司。这些公司通过法律手段或电话骚扰等方式重新追讨已过期的债务，“僵尸”一词形象地描述了这些“死而复生”的债务。  
  The concept of zombie debt originated in the United States in the 1990s when widespread use of credit cards and consumer loans led banks to sell large amounts of overdue debt to third-party collection agencies. These agencies revived expired debts through legal means or harassment tactics, with the term "zombie" vividly describing these "resurrected" debts.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在中国，随着金融市场的快速发展和个人信贷的普及，僵尸债务问题逐渐显现。一些不良资产处置公司利用法律漏洞和债务人信息不对称的优势进行追债活动，引发了社会对消费者权益保护的关注。目前，监管部门正在加强对这一领域的规范管理。  
  In China, with the rapid development of financial markets and the popularity of personal credit, zombie debt issues have gradually emerged. Some distressed asset management companies exploit legal loopholes and information asymmetry to pursue debt collection activities, raising concerns about consumer rights protection. Currently, regulatory authorities are strengthening oversight in this area.
