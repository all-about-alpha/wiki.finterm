# Zeta Model

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  Zeta模型是由爱德华·阿尔特曼（Edward Altman）于1968年开发的一种财务预测模型，主要用于评估企业的破产风险。该模型通过分析企业的财务比率（如盈利能力、杠杆率、流动性等）来计算一个综合得分（Z-Score），从而预测企业在未来两年内破产的可能性。  
  The Zeta Model, developed by Edward Altman in 1968, is a financial forecasting model primarily used to assess the bankruptcy risk of companies. It calculates a composite score (Z-Score) by analyzing financial ratios (such as profitability, leverage, liquidity, etc.) to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt within the next two years.

* **应用 / Application**  
  Zeta模型广泛应用于企业信用评级、投资分析和风险管理领域。投资者和金融机构使用该模型来评估企业的财务健康状况，从而做出更明智的投资或贷款决策。需要注意的是，该模型主要适用于制造业企业，对其他行业的适用性可能有限。  
  The Zeta Model is widely used in corporate credit rating, investment analysis, and risk management. Investors and financial institutions use this model to assess the financial health of companies, enabling them to make more informed investment or lending decisions. It is important to note that the model is primarily applicable to manufacturing firms and may have limited applicability to other industries.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管、投资和行业角度来看，Zeta模型在财务风险预警中具有重要意义。它为投资者提供了一个量化的工具来评估企业的破产风险，同时也帮助金融机构更好地管理信贷风险。此外，该模型在学术研究和实践中被广泛引用，成为财务分析领域的经典工具之一。  
  From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, the Zeta Model holds significant importance in financial risk early warning. It provides investors with a quantitative tool to assess bankruptcy risk and helps financial institutions better manage credit risk. Additionally, the model is widely cited in academic research and practice, becoming one of the classic tools in financial analysis.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  Zeta模型由纽约大学斯特恩商学院的教授爱德华·阿尔特曼于1968年提出。阿尔特曼通过对美国制造业企业的财务数据进行分析，开发了这一模型。该模型最初基于66家企业的样本数据，通过多元判别分析（MDA）方法构建，旨在预测企业的破产风险。  
  The Zeta Model was proposed by Edward Altman, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, in 1968. Altman developed this model by analyzing the financial data of U.S. manufacturing firms. Initially based on a sample of 66 companies, the model was constructed using multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) to predict corporate bankruptcy risk.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  Zeta模型自提出以来，对全球金融行业产生了深远影响。它不仅在企业破产预测领域取得了显著成果，还被广泛应用于信用评级和风险管理。尽管该模型最初针对制造业设计，但其核心思想和方法已被扩展到其他行业，并衍生出多种改进版本。  
  Since its introduction, the Zeta Model has had a profound impact on the global financial industry. It has not only achieved significant results in the field of corporate bankruptcy prediction but has also been widely applied in credit rating and risk management.
