# Zero-Bound Interest Rate

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **零利率下限**是指中央银行将基准利率降至接近或等于零的水平，以刺激经济增长和应对通缩压力。这一概念由经济学家提出，核心在于当利率降至零时，传统货币政策工具（如降息）的效力将受到限制。  
  **Zero-Bound Interest Rate** refers to the situation where a central bank lowers its benchmark interest rate to near or at zero to stimulate economic growth and combat deflationary pressures. This concept, introduced by economists, highlights the limitation of traditional monetary policy tools (such as rate cuts) when rates approach zero.

* **应用 / Application**  
  在金融危机或经济衰退期间，中央银行可能采用零利率下限政策以鼓励借贷和投资。然而，长期维持零利率可能导致资产泡沫、银行盈利能力下降以及货币政策失效等风险。  
  During financial crises or economic recessions, central banks may adopt a zero-bound interest rate policy to encourage borrowing and investment. However, prolonged zero rates may lead to risks such as asset bubbles, reduced bank profitability, and diminished effectiveness of monetary policy.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，零利率下限是应对极端经济状况的重要工具；从投资角度看，它影响资产配置和收益率；从行业角度看，它改变了银行、企业和消费者的行为模式。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the zero-bound interest rate is a crucial tool for addressing extreme economic conditions; from an investment perspective, it impacts asset allocation and yields; from an industry perspective, it alters the behavior patterns of banks, businesses, and consumers.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  零利率下限的概念在20世纪90年代日本经济“失落的十年”期间首次被广泛讨论。日本央行为应对通缩和经济停滞，将利率降至接近零的水平。2008年全球金融危机后，美联储、欧洲央行等也采用了类似政策。  
  The concept of the zero-bound interest rate was first widely discussed during Japan's "Lost Decade" in the 1990s. The Bank of Japan lowered rates to near zero to combat deflation and economic stagnation. Following the 2008 global financial crisis, central banks like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank adopted similar policies.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  在日本，长期零利率政策未能彻底解决通缩问题，反而导致银行盈利能力下降和财政压力增加。在全球范围内，这一政策虽短期内刺激了经济复苏，但也引发了关于长期副作用（如资产价格扭曲）的争议。  
  In Japan, prolonged zero rates failed to fully resolve deflation but led to reduced bank profitability and increased fiscal pressure. Globally, while this policy stimulated short-term recovery, it also sparked debates about long-term side effects such as asset price distortions.
