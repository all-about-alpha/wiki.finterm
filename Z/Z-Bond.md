# Z-Bond

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  Z-Bond，也称为零息债券（Zero-Coupon Bond），是一种不支付定期利息的债券。投资者以低于面值的价格购买，到期时按面值赎回，其收益来源于购买价格与面值之间的差额。Z-Bond的核心概念在于其“零息”特性，即不提供定期利息支付，而是通过折价发行实现收益。  
  A Z-Bond, also known as a Zero-Coupon Bond, is a type of bond that does not pay periodic interest. Investors purchase it at a price below its face value and redeem it at face value upon maturity, with the profit derived from the difference between the purchase price and the face value. The core concept of a Z-Bond lies in its "zero-coupon" feature, meaning it does not provide regular interest payments but achieves returns through discounted issuance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  Z-Bond常用于长期投资或为未来特定支出（如教育基金、退休计划）积累资金。由于其不支付利息，投资者无需担心再投资风险，但需注意利率波动对债券价格的影响。此外，Z-Bond的税务处理也需特别关注，因为尽管不支付利息，但其隐含利息可能仍需纳税。  
  Z-Bonds are commonly used for long-term investments or to accumulate funds for specific future expenses (e.g., education funds, retirement plans). Since they do not pay interest, investors do not need to worry about reinvestment risk, but they should be aware of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on bond prices. Additionally, the tax treatment of Z-Bonds requires special attention, as their implied interest may still be taxable despite the absence of periodic payments.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，Z-Bond为投资者提供了一种规避再投资风险的工具；从投资角度看，它适合追求长期稳定收益的投资者；从行业角度看，Z-Bond丰富了债券市场的产品结构，满足了多样化的投资需求。  
  From a regulatory perspective, Z-Bonds provide investors with a tool to avoid reinvestment risk; from an investment perspective, they are suitable for investors seeking long-term stable returns; from an industry perspective, Z-Bonds enrich the product structure of the bond market and meet diverse investment needs.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  Z-Bond的概念最早可追溯到20世纪70年代美国金融市场。当时，为了满足投资者对长期稳定收益的需求以及规避利率波动的风险，金融机构开始发行零息债券。1982年，美国财政部首次发行了零息国债（STRIPS），标志着Z-Bond在主流金融市场中的正式确立。  
  The concept of Z-Bonds can be traced back to the U.S. financial markets in the 1970s. At that time, to meet investors' demand for long-term stable returns and hedge against interest rate fluctuations, financial institutions began issuing zero-coupon bonds. In 1982, the U.S. Treasury issued its first zero-coupon Treasury securities (STRIPS), marking the formal establishment of Z-Bonds in mainstream financial markets.
