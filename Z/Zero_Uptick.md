# Zero Uptick

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：零上涨（Zero Uptick）是指证券交易中，某只股票的价格与前一交易价格相同，但高于最近一次不同价格的交易价格。这一概念常用于卖空交易中，特别是在美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的“零上涨规则”（Zero Uptick Rule）中，该规则规定卖空交易只能在股票价格出现上涨时进行。  
  **English Explanation**: Zero Uptick refers to a situation in securities trading where the price of a stock is the same as the previous trade price but higher than the last different trade price. This concept is often used in the context of short selling, particularly under the SEC's "Zero Uptick Rule," which stipulates that short sales can only be executed when the stock price has experienced an uptick.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：零上涨规则主要用于防止卖空交易在市场下跌时加剧股价的下跌压力。该规则要求卖空者只能在股价上涨或持平（但高于最近一次不同价格）时进行卖空操作。这一规则在2007年被废除，但在某些市场条件下，监管机构可能会重新考虑其适用性。  
  **English Explanation**: The Zero Uptick Rule is primarily used to prevent short selling from exacerbating downward pressure on stock prices during market declines.
