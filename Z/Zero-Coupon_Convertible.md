# Zero-Coupon Convertible

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **零息可转换债券**是一种特殊的金融工具，它结合了零息债券和可转换债券的特点。零息债券在发行时不支付利息，而是以折价发行，到期时按面值偿还；可转换债券则允许持有人在特定条件下将债券转换为发行公司的股票。因此，零息可转换债券在持有期间不支付利息，但持有人有权在约定条件下将其转换为股票。  
  **A Zero-Coupon Convertible** is a unique financial instrument that combines the features of a zero-coupon bond and a convertible bond. A zero-coupon bond is issued at a discount and pays no interest during its term, repaying the face value at maturity. A convertible bond allows the holder to convert the bond into the issuer's stock under specific conditions. Thus, a zero-coupon convertible pays no interest during its term but grants the holder the right to convert it into stock under agreed-upon conditions.

* **应用 / Application**  
  零息可转换债券通常被企业用于融资，尤其是那些希望降低短期利息支出但愿意在未来通过股权稀释来偿还债务的公司。投资者则可能被其潜在的资本增值和转股权利所吸引。然而，投资者需注意市场波动、利率变化以及公司信用风险等因素对债券价值的影响。  
  Zero-coupon convertibles are often used by companies for financing, particularly those looking to reduce short-term interest expenses but willing to repay debt through equity dilution in the future. Investors may be attracted by their potential capital appreciation and conversion rights. However, investors should be aware of factors such as market volatility, interest rate changes, and issuer credit risk that can affect the bond's value.

  从监管角度看，零息可转换债券为企业提供了一种灵活的融资方式，同时为投资者提供了多样化的投资选择。从投资角度看，它结合了固定收益和股权投资的优势，适合风险偏好较高的投资者。从行业角度看，这种工具的创新推动了资本市场的发展和完善。
