# Z Tranche

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  Z档（Z Tranche）是资产支持证券（ABS）或抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）中的一种特殊档级，通常作为最后获得本金和利息支付的档级。它也被称为“应计档”或“零息档”，因为在其之前的其他档级未完全偿付之前，Z档不会收到任何现金流。  
  The Z Tranche is a special class within asset-backed securities (ABS) or mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that typically receives principal and interest payments last. It is also known as the "accrual tranche" or "zero-coupon tranche" because it does not receive any cash flow until all preceding tranches have been fully paid.

* **应用 / Application**  
  Z档通常用于结构化金融产品中，为投资者提供更高的潜在回报，但同时也伴随着更高的风险。由于其支付顺序靠后，Z档对基础资产的信用风险更为敏感。投资者在购买Z档时需仔细评估其风险承受能力和市场环境。  
  The Z Tranche is commonly used in structured financial products to offer investors higher potential returns, but it also carries higher risks. Due to its subordinate payment priority, the Z Tranche is more sensitive to the credit risk of the underlying assets. Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance and market conditions before investing in a Z Tranche.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  从监管角度看，Z档的存在有助于分散风险并提高金融产品的吸引力；从投资角度看，它为高风险偏好的投资者提供了高收益机会；从行业角度看，Z档是结构化金融产品设计中的重要组成部分。  
  From a regulatory perspective, the existence of the Z Tranche helps diversify risks and enhance the appeal of financial products; from an investment perspective, it offers high-yield opportunities for risk-tolerant investors; from an industry perspective, the Z Tranche is a critical component in the design of structured financial products.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  Z档的概念起源于20世纪80年代美国抵押贷款支持证券市场的创新。随着结构化金融产品的快速发展，金融机构开始设计不同支付顺序的档级以满足多样化的投资需求。Z档作为最后支付的档级，逐渐成为复杂金融工具的一部分。  
  The concept of the Z Tranche originated in the 1980s with innovations in the U.S. mortgage-backed securities market. As structured financial products rapidly evolved, financial institutions began designing tranches with varying payment priorities to meet diverse investment needs. The Z Tranche, as the last-to-pay tranche, gradually became part of complex financial instruments.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  Z档的出现推动了结构化金融市场的发展，但也因其高风险特性在2008年金融危机中受到关注。如今，Z档仍然是资产证券化产品中的重要组成部分，但其设计和销售受到更严格的监管审查。  
  The introduction of the Z Tranche spurred the growth of structured financial markets but also drew attention during the 2008 financial crisis due to its high-risk nature. Today, the Z Tranche remains an important component of asset securitization products, but its design and sale are subject to stricter regulatory scrutiny.
