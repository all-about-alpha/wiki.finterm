# Whisper Number

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Whisper Number（耳语数字）是指市场参与者私下流传的、未经官方发布的关于公司财务业绩的预测数字。它通常由分析师、投资者或交易员通过非正式渠道传播，反映了市场对某公司即将公布的财务结果的预期。与官方发布的共识预测（Consensus Estimate）不同，Whisper Number更具主观性和投机性。  
  **English Explanation**: A Whisper Number is an unofficial, privately circulated forecast of a company's financial performance, often shared among market participants such as analysts, investors, or traders. It represents the market's expectations for a company's upcoming financial results and is distinct from the official Consensus Estimate, being more subjective and speculative in nature.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Whisper Number常用于股票交易中，投资者根据这些非正式预测调整投资策略，尤其是在财报发布前。它可以帮助捕捉市场情绪，但也存在误导风险，因为其来源和准确性难以验证。  
  **English Application**: Whisper Numbers are frequently used in stock trading, where investors adjust their strategies based on these unofficial forecasts, especially ahead of earnings announcements. They can help gauge market sentiment but carry the risk of being misleading due to their unverified sources and accuracy.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从投资角度看，Whisper Number提供了市场预期的另一种视角，可能影响股价波动。然而，由于其非正式性，监管机构通常不认可其作为投资决策的依据。在行业中，它反映了信息不对称和市场的投机性。  
  **English Significance**: From an investment perspective, Whisper Numbers offer an alternative view of market expectations and can influence stock price movements. However, due to their unofficial nature, regulatory bodies generally do not recognize them as a basis for investment decisions. In the industry, they highlight information asymmetry and market speculation.
