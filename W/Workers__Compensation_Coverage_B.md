  Workers' Compensation Coverage B，也称为雇主责任保险（Employer's Liability Insurance），是工伤保险的一部分，旨在为雇主提供额外的保障。它覆盖了员工因工作受伤或患病而向雇主提出诉讼的情况，超出了工伤保险（Coverage A）的基本赔偿范围。Coverage B通常用于赔偿员工的医疗费用、工资损失以及法律费用等。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  Workers' Compensation Coverage B, also known as Employer's Liability Insurance, is a component of workers' compensation that provides additional protection for employers. It covers situations where employees sue their employers for work-related injuries or illnesses, extending beyond the basic compensation provided by Workers' Compensation Coverage A. Coverage B typically covers medical expenses, lost wages, and legal fees for employees.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  Coverage B通常适用于员工因工作受伤或患病后，认为雇主存在过失或未提供安全工作环境而提起诉讼的情况。例如，员工因设备故障受伤，而雇主未能及时维护设备，员工可能会通过Coverage B索赔。需要注意的是，Coverage B的赔偿金额通常有限制，且不覆盖故意行为或重大过失。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  Coverage B is typically applied when employees sue their employers for work-related injuries or illnesses, alleging negligence or failure to provide a safe working environment. For example, if an employee is injured due to equipment failure and the employer failed to maintain the equipment, the employee may file a claim under Coverage B. It is important to note that Coverage B usually has limits on the amount of compensation and does not cover intentional acts or gross negligence.
