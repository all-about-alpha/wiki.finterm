# Wash-Sale Rule

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：洗售规则（Wash-Sale Rule）是美国证券交易委员会（SEC）制定的一项税务规则，旨在防止投资者通过短期内卖出并重新买入相同或实质上相似的证券来制造虚假的税务损失。根据该规则，如果投资者在卖出证券后的30天内重新买入相同或实质上相似的证券，其税务损失将不被允许用于抵扣资本利得税。  
  **English Explanation**: The Wash-Sale Rule is a tax regulation established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent investors from creating artificial tax losses by selling and repurchasing the same or substantially identical securities within a short period. According to this rule, if an investor repurchases the same or substantially identical securities within 30 days of selling them, the tax loss from the sale cannot be used to offset capital gains taxes.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**：洗售规则主要应用于投资者在年底进行税务规划时，试图通过卖出亏损证券来减少应纳税额。然而，如果投资者在30天内重新买入相同证券，其亏损将不被税务部门认可。投资者需注意，该规则不仅适用于股票，还适用于期权、基金等其他证券。  
  **English Explanation**: The Wash-Sale Rule is primarily applied when investors engage in year-end tax planning, attempting to reduce taxable income by selling losing securities. However, if the investor repurchases the same securities within 30 days, the loss will not be recognized by tax authorities. Investors should note that this rule applies not only to stocks but also to options, mutual funds, and other securities.
