# Whitewash Resolution

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：白洗决议（Whitewash Resolution）是指在公司并购或重组过程中，目标公司的董事会通过一项决议，声明其认为收购方的出价是公平合理的，且符合公司及股东的最佳利益。这一决议通常用于避免触发某些法律条款或监管要求，例如在英国《城市收购与合并守则》（City Code on Takeovers and Mergers）中，白洗决议可以豁免强制收购要约的义务。  
  **English Explanation**: A Whitewash Resolution is a resolution passed by the board of directors of a target company during a merger or acquisition, stating that they consider the offer from the acquirer to be fair and reasonable, and in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. This resolution is often used to avoid triggering certain legal provisions or regulatory requirements, such as exempting the obligation for a mandatory takeover bid under the UK's City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：白洗决议常见于涉及大股东或关联方的交易中，特别是在大股东增持股份或进行私有化时。通过白洗决议，公司可以避免因触发强制收购要约而增加交易成本或复杂性。需要注意的是，白洗决议的通过需经过独立股东的批准，以确保交易的公平性。  
  **English Application**: Whitewash Resolutions are commonly used in transactions involving major shareholders or related parties, especially when a major shareholder increases their stake or takes the company private. By passing a Whitewash Resolution, the company can avoid increasing transaction costs or complexity due to triggering a mandatory takeover bid. It is important to note that the passage of a Whitewash Resolution requires approval from independent shareholders to ensure fairness.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，白洗决议有助于简化交易流程并降低合规成本；从投资角度看，它为股东提供了额外的保护机制；从行业角度看，它促进了资本市场的灵活性和效率。然而，滥用白洗决议可能导致少数股东利益受损，因此需严格监管。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Whitewash Resolutions help simplify transaction processes and reduce compliance costs; from an investment perspective, they provide additional protection mechanisms for shareholders; from an industry perspective, they promote flexibility and efficiency in capital markets. However, misuse of Whitewash Resolutions may harm minority shareholders' interests, necessitating strict oversight.
