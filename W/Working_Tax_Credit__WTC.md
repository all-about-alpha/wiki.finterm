## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 工作税收抵免（Working Tax Credit, WTC）是英国政府为低收入工作者提供的一种财政补贴，旨在通过税收减免的方式增加其可支配收入。该政策由英国税务海关总署（HMRC）管理，适用于符合特定收入和工作时间要求的个人或家庭。  
  **English Explanation**: The Working Tax Credit (WTC) is a financial subsidy provided by the UK government to low-income workers, designed to increase their disposable income through tax relief. Administered by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), it is available to individuals or families who meet specific income and working hours requirements.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**: WTC主要适用于全职或兼职工作的低收入人群，尤其是单亲家庭、残疾人士或有子女的家庭。申请人需满足每周最低工作时间要求，并提交收入证明。需要注意的是，WTC的金额会根据收入变化而调整，且与其他福利可能存在冲突。  
  **English Application Scenarios**: WTC primarily targets low-income individuals working full-time or part-time, particularly single parents, disabled individuals, or families with children. Applicants must meet minimum weekly working hours and provide proof of income. It is important to note that the amount of WTC may adjust based on income changes and may conflict with other benefits.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: WTC在英国的福利体系中扮演着重要角色，帮助低收入工作者减轻生活负担，促进就业积极性。从监管角度看，它是政府调节收入分配、减少贫困的重要工具；从行业角度看，它有助于稳定劳动力市场。  
  **English Significance**: WTC plays a crucial role in the UK’s welfare system by alleviating the financial burden on low-income workers and encouraging employment. From a regulatory perspective, it is a key tool for income redistribution and poverty reduction; from an industry perspective, it helps stabilize the labor market.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: WTC于2003年由英国工党政府引入，作为税收抵免制度的一部分，旨在整合原有的家庭税收抵免和残疾人税收抵免政策。其设计灵感来源于美国的“劳动所得税抵免”（EITC），并结合了英国的实际情况进行了调整。  
  **English Origin**: The WTC was introduced in 2003 by the UK Labour government as part of the tax credit system, aiming to integrate the existing Family Credit and Disabled Person’s Tax Credit policies. Its design was inspired by the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) but adapted to fit the UK context.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**: WTC的推出显著改善了英国低收入家庭的生活水平，提高了就业率，但也因复杂的申请流程和频繁的政策调整而受到批评。目前，WTC正逐步被“通用信贷”（Universal Credit）取代，但其在福利改革中的历史地位不可忽视。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of WTC significantly improved living standards for low-income families in the UK and boosted employment rates. However, it has faced criticism for its complex application process and frequent policy changes. Currently, WTC is being phased out in favor of Universal Credit, but its historical role in welfare reform remains significant.
