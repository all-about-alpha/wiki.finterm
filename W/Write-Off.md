# Write-Off

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：  
  核销（Write-Off）是指企业或金融机构将无法收回的资产（如坏账、贬值资产等）从财务报表中移除的过程。这一操作通常用于反映资产的真实价值，避免财务报表中的虚高现象。核销的核心概念在于确认资产的损失，并将其从资产负债表中剔除。  
  **English Explanation**：  
  A write-off is the process by which a business or financial institution removes an asset (such as bad debt or depreciated assets) from its financial statements because it is deemed unrecoverable. This action is typically used to reflect the true value of assets and avoid overstatement in financial reports. The core concept of a write-off is to recognize the loss of an asset and remove it from the balance sheet.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：  
  核销常用于处理坏账、固定资产报废或无形资产减值等情况。例如，银行在确认某笔贷款无法收回时，会将其作为坏账核销。需要注意的是，核销并不意味着放弃追索权，企业仍可能通过法律手段追讨欠款。此外，核销会影响企业的利润表和资产负债表，需谨慎操作。  
  **English Application Scenarios**：  
  Write-offs are commonly used to handle bad debts, disposal of fixed assets, or impairment of intangible assets. For instance, a bank may write off a loan as bad debt when it is deemed unrecoverable. It’s important to note that a write-off does not necessarily mean relinquishing the right to pursue recovery; legal actions may still be taken. Additionally, write-offs impact both the income statement and balance sheet, requiring careful consideration.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：  
  从监管角度看，核销有助于提高财务透明度，确保企业真实反映其财务状况。从投资角度看，频繁的核销可能暗示企业管理不善或行业风险较高。对于行业而言，合理的核销机制有助于维护金融系统的稳定性。  
  **English Significance**：  
  From a regulatory perspective, write-offs enhance financial transparency by ensuring that businesses accurately reflect their financial status. From an investment standpoint, frequent write-offs may indicate poor management or high industry risks. For industries, a reasonable write-off mechanism helps maintain the stability of the financial system.
