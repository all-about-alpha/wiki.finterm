## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：工人赔偿保险的起源可以追溯到19世纪末的工业革命时期。随着工厂生产的普及，工伤事故频发，但当时缺乏有效的法律保护工人权益。1884年，德国率先通过《工伤事故保险法》，成为世界上第一个实施强制性工人赔偿制度的国家。此后，其他国家纷纷效仿，逐步建立了类似的制度。中国于1951年颁布《劳动保险条例》，标志着工伤保险制度的初步建立。  
  **English Origin**: The origin of workers' compensation insurance can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. With the rise of factory production, workplace accidents became frequent, but there was a lack of effective legal protection for workers' rights. In 1884, Germany passed the "Work Accident Insurance Law," becoming the first country in the world to implement a mandatory workers' compensation system. Subsequently, other countries followed suit and gradually established similar systems. China enacted the "Labor Insurance Regulations" in 1951, marking the initial establishment of its work injury insurance system.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**：工人赔偿保险的引入显著改善了工人的工作条件和福利待遇，减少了因工伤引发的社会矛盾。在中国，《工伤保险条例》的实施进一步规范了企业的用工行为，提高了劳动者的安全保障水平。目前，中国的工伤保险制度已覆盖大部分企业和职工，成为社会保障体系的重要组成部分。  
  **English Impact**: The introduction of workers' compensation insurance significantly improved working conditions and welfare benefits for workers and reduced social conflicts caused by workplace injuries. In China, the implementation of the "Work Injury Insurance Regulations" further standardized employment practices among enterprises and enhanced safety protections for workers.
