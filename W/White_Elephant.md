  **中文解释**：白象（White Elephant）源自古代东南亚文化，指一种珍贵但难以维护或成本高昂的资产或项目。在现代金融领域，白象通常指那些看似有价值但实际上带来巨大负担的投资或资产，因其维护成本过高或无法产生预期收益而成为累赘。  
  **English Explanation**: The term "White Elephant" originates from ancient Southeast Asian culture, referring to a valuable but difficult-to-maintain or costly asset or project. In modern finance, a white elephant typically denotes an investment or asset that appears valuable but actually becomes a burden due to its high maintenance costs or failure to generate expected returns.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：在投资和项目管理中，白象常用来形容那些因规划不当、市场变化或管理失误而导致的高成本、低回报的项目。例如，某些大型基础设施项目或房地产开发项目可能因过度投资或需求不足而成为白象。投资者需警惕此类项目，避免陷入长期亏损的困境。  
  **English Application**: In investment and project management, white elephants are often used to describe projects that become high-cost, low-return due to poor planning, market changes, or management errors. For example, certain large-scale infrastructure projects or real estate developments may become white elephants due to overinvestment or insufficient demand. Investors should be cautious of such projects to avoid long-term losses.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管、投资和行业角度来看，识别和避免白象项目对于资源优化和风险控制至关重要。监管机构需加强对大型项目的审查，投资者应注重项目的可持续性和回报率，而行业则需提升规划和管理能力以减少白象现象的发生。  
  **English Significance**: From regulatory, investment, and industry perspectives, identifying and avoiding white elephant projects is crucial for resource optimization and risk control. Regulatory bodies need to strengthen scrutiny of large projects, investors should focus on sustainability and return rates, and industries must improve planning and management capabilities to reduce the occurrence of white elephants.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：白象的概念最早可追溯到古代东南亚国家，如泰国和缅甸。在这些国家，白象被视为神圣的动物，象征着权力和财富。然而，由于饲养和维护白象的成本极高，拥有白象反而成为一种负担。这一概念后来被引入金融领域，用以形容那些看似珍贵但实际带来负担的资产或项目。

In these regions, white elephants were considered sacred animals symbolizing power and wealth. However, due to the extremely high costs of raising and maintaining them, owning a white elephant became a burden. This concept was later introduced into finance to describe assets or projects that appear valuable but are actually burdensome.
