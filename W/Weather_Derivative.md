# Weather Derivative

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  天气衍生品（Weather Derivative）是一种金融工具，其价值与特定天气条件（如温度、降雨量、风速等）的变化相关联。它最初由能源公司于20世纪90年代开发，用于对冲因天气波动导致的收入或成本风险。核心概念是通过金融合约将天气风险转移给愿意承担该风险的投资者或机构。  

  **English Explanation**  
  A weather derivative is a financial instrument whose value is linked to specific weather conditions, such as temperature, rainfall, or wind speed. It was originally developed by energy companies in the 1990s to hedge against revenue or cost risks caused by weather fluctuations. The core concept involves transferring weather risk to investors or institutions willing to assume it through financial contracts.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**  
  天气衍生品广泛应用于农业、能源、旅游和零售等行业。例如，农业企业可以通过天气衍生品对冲因干旱或洪涝导致的减产风险；能源公司则用于管理因异常气温导致的电力需求波动。需要注意的是，天气衍生品的定价和风险管理依赖于精确的气象数据和模型，因此存在一定的模型风险和流动性风险。  

  **English Application**  
  Weather derivatives are widely used in industries such as agriculture, energy, tourism, and retail. For instance, agricultural businesses can hedge against crop yield risks caused by droughts or floods, while energy companies use them to manage fluctuations in electricity demand due to abnormal temperatures. It is important to note that the pricing and risk management of weather derivatives rely on accurate meteorological data and models, which introduces model risk and liquidity risk.
