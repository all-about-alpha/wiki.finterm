## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：磨损与损耗排除条款最早可追溯到19世纪的英国财产保险实践。当时，保险公司发现许多索赔案件涉及设备的自然老化而非意外损坏，因此引入该条款以明确责任边界。20世纪初，随着工业化进程加速，该条款被广泛应用于机械设备保险中。  
  **English Origin**: The Wear and Tear Exclusion can be traced back to British property insurance practices in the 19th century. At that time, insurers noticed that many claims involved natural aging of equipment rather than accidental damage, leading to the introduction of this clause to clarify liability boundaries. By the early 20th century, with the acceleration of industrialization, this clause was widely adopted in machinery and equipment insurance.
