## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  该术语起源于20世纪90年代的美国天然气期货市场。当时，天然气价格因供需失衡和天气因素频繁大幅波动，导致许多投资者在短时间内遭受巨额亏损甚至破产。“Widow Maker”因此得名，成为高风险交易的代名词。著名案例包括1995年加州能源危机期间天然气价格的暴涨暴跌。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The term originated in the U.S. natural gas futures market in the 1990s. At that time, natural gas prices experienced frequent and drastic fluctuations due to supply-demand imbalances and weather factors, leading many investors to suffer massive losses or even bankruptcy within short periods. Thus, "Widow Maker" became synonymous with high-risk trading. A notable example is the dramatic price swings during the California energy crisis of 1995.
