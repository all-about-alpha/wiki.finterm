# White Squire

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：白骑士（White Squire）是指一家公司或投资者在另一家公司面临敌意收购时，通过购买其部分股份来提供支持，从而帮助目标公司抵御收购。与“白骑士”（White Knight）不同，白骑士通常完全收购目标公司，而白骑士仅持有部分股份，不寻求控制权。  
  **English Explanation**: A White Squire refers to a company or investor that purchases a portion of the shares of a target company facing a hostile takeover, providing support to help the target company fend off the acquisition. Unlike a "White Knight," which typically acquires the entire company, a White Squire only holds a minority stake and does not seek control.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：白骑士策略常用于企业并购防御中，特别是在目标公司不希望被敌意收购者控制时。通过引入友好的投资者持有部分股份，目标公司可以稀释敌意收购者的股权比例，增加收购难度。需要注意的是，白骑士的介入可能引发股东利益冲突或监管审查。  
  **English Application**: The White Squire strategy is often used in corporate takeover defenses, especially when the target company does not want to be controlled by a hostile acquirer. By introducing friendly investors to hold a portion of the shares, the target company can dilute the hostile acquirer's stake and increase the difficulty of the acquisition. It is important to note that the involvement of a White Squire may lead to conflicts of interest among shareholders or regulatory scrutiny.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，白骑士策略有助于维护市场公平竞争；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了参与企业并购的机会；从行业角度看，它保护了目标公司的独立性和长期发展。然而，过度依赖白骑士可能导致股东权益受损或市场垄断风险。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, the White Squire strategy helps maintain fair market competition; from an investment perspective, it provides opportunities for investors to participate in corporate takeovers; from an industry perspective, it protects the independence and long-term development of target companies. However, over-reliance on White Squires may lead to shareholder rights being compromised or market monopoly risks.
