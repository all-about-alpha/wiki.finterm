## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  保费豁免条款最早出现在20世纪初的美国人寿保险市场。当时经济波动频繁，许多投保人因失业或疾病无法继续支付保费，导致保单失效。为应对这一问题，保险公司引入了“保费豁免”机制，最初仅针对完全残疾的投保人。随着市场需求增加和产品创新，这一条款逐渐扩展到其他触发条件（如重病或失业）。中国在20世纪90年代引入类似条款，结合本土需求进行了优化。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The waiver of premium clause first appeared in the U.S. life insurance market in the early 20th century. During that time, frequent economic fluctuations left many policyholders unable to continue premium payments due to unemployment or illness, leading to policy lapses. To address this issue, insurers introduced the "waiver of premium" mechanism, initially limited to total disability cases. As market demand grew and products evolved, this clause expanded to include other triggers (e.g., critical illness or unemployment). China adopted similar clauses in the 1990s and optimized them based on local needs.

In China’s market, "waiver of premium" has become a standard feature in many long-term protection plans.
