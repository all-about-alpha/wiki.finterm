# Write-Down

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 减记（Write-Down）是指企业在财务报表中对其资产价值进行下调的会计处理。通常发生在资产的市场价值低于其账面价值时，企业需要根据会计准则将资产价值减记至其可回收金额或公允价值。这一过程反映了资产的减值损失，直接影响企业的利润表和资产负债表。  
  **English Explanation**: A write-down is an accounting process where a company reduces the carrying value of an asset on its financial statements. This typically occurs when the market value of the asset falls below its book value, and the company must adjust the asset's value to its recoverable amount or fair value in accordance with accounting standards. This process reflects an impairment loss and directly impacts the company's income statement and balance sheet.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 减记常见于固定资产、无形资产、存货等资产的减值处理。例如，当一家公司的设备因技术过时而贬值，或存货因市场需求下降而滞销时，企业需要进行减记。减记不仅影响当期利润，还可能引发投资者对公司财务状况的担忧。  
  **English Application**: Write-downs are commonly applied to fixed assets, intangible assets, and inventory. For example, when a company's equipment becomes obsolete due to technological advancements or inventory becomes unsellable due to declining market demand, a write-down is necessary. This not only affects current profits but may also raise concerns among investors about the company's financial health.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，减记是确保财务报表真实性和透明性的重要手段；从投资角度看，减记反映了公司资产的实际价值，帮助投资者做出更准确的决策；从行业角度看，频繁的减记可能预示着行业整体面临挑战。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, write-downs are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and transparency of financial statements; from an investment perspective, they reflect the actual value of a company's assets, aiding investors in making informed decisions; from an industry perspective, frequent write-downs may indicate broader challenges within the sector.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**: 减记的概念起源于20世纪初的会计实践，随着工业革命后企业资产规模的扩大和复杂化，资产减值问题逐渐凸显。1929年大萧条期间，许多企业因资产大幅贬值而被迫进行大规模减记，这促使会计准则逐步完善。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of write-downs originated in early 20th-century accounting practices. As industrial enterprises expanded and their assets became more complex post-Industrial Revolution, issues of asset impairment became prominent. During the Great Depression of 1929, many companies were forced to undertake significant write-downs due to massive asset devaluations, which led to the gradual refinement of accounting standards.

  **中文影响**: 减记对企业的财务健康和投资者信心具有深远影响。例如2008年金融危机期间，全球金融机构因次贷危机进行了巨额资产减记，导致市场动荡和监管改革。如今，减记已成为企业财务管理和风险控制的重要工具。  
  **English Impact**: Write-downs have profound effects on a company's financial health and investor confidence.
