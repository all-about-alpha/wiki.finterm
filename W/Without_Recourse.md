# Without Recourse

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：无追索权（Without Recourse）是一种金融术语，指在票据或贷款交易中，持票人或贷款人放弃对出票人或借款人的追索权利。这意味着如果债务人无法履行还款义务，债权人无权向债务人以外的第三方追讨债务。这一概念常用于票据贴现、保理业务和资产证券化等金融活动中。  
  **English Explanation**: "Without Recourse" is a financial term indicating that the holder of a note or the lender waives the right to seek repayment from the issuer or borrower in case of default. This means that if the debtor fails to fulfill their obligations, the creditor cannot pursue third parties for repayment. This concept is commonly used in financial activities such as bill discounting, factoring, and asset securitization.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：无追索权条款常见于国际贸易中的信用证交易、保理业务以及资产证券化产品中。例如，在保理业务中，卖方将应收账款出售给保理商时，若采用无追索权方式，保理商将承担买方无法付款的风险。风险提示：无追索权交易通常伴随更高的费用或折扣率，因为债权人承担了更大的风险。  
  **English Application**: The "Without Recourse" clause is frequently used in international trade for letter of credit transactions, factoring, and asset-backed securities. For example, in factoring, if a seller sells receivables to a factor on a without recourse basis, the factor assumes the risk of non-payment by the buyer. Risk Note: Without recourse transactions often come with higher fees or discount rates because the creditor bears greater risk.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：从监管角度看，无追索权条款有助于明确各方责任，降低法律纠纷；从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了更高的风险溢价机会；从行业角度看，它促进了金融创新和资本流动。
