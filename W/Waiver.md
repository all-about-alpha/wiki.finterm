## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 弃权（Waiver）是指一方自愿放弃其合法权利或主张的行为。在金融和法律领域，弃权通常通过书面形式明确表示，以确保其法律效力。弃权的核心概念在于自愿性和明确性，即当事人必须清楚知道自己放弃的权利内容。  
  **English Explanation**: A waiver is the voluntary relinquishment or surrender of a legal right or claim. In financial and legal contexts, waivers are typically formalized in writing to ensure their legal enforceability. The core concepts of a waiver are voluntariness and clarity, meaning the party must be fully aware of the rights they are giving up.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: 弃权在金融交易、合同签订和纠纷解决中广泛应用。例如，投资者可能签署弃权书以放弃对某些投资风险的追索权；在保险合同中，被保险人可能通过弃权条款放弃对某些损失的索赔权利。需要注意的是，弃权一旦生效，通常不可撤销，因此签署前需谨慎评估风险。  
  **English Application**: Waivers are widely used in financial transactions, contract agreements, and dispute resolutions. For instance, investors may sign waivers to relinquish claims against certain investment risks; in insurance contracts, policyholders may waive their rights to claim certain losses through waiver clauses. It is crucial to note that once a waiver is effective, it is generally irrevocable, so careful risk assessment is essential before signing.

  **中文起源**: 弃权的概念最早可追溯至古罗马法中的“放弃权利”原则。在中世纪欧洲的封建制度下，领主与封臣之间的权利让渡也体现了类似的思想。现代意义上的弃权则随着商业法和合同法的发展而逐渐完善，特别是在19世纪的英美法系中得到了系统化规范。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of waiver dates back to the principle of "relinquishing rights" in ancient Roman law. During medieval Europe's feudal system, similar ideas were reflected in the transfer of rights between lords and vassals.
