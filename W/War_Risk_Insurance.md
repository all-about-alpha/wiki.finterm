## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文解释**：战争风险保险的起源可以追溯到19世纪末和20世纪初的欧洲工业化时期。随着国际贸易和航运业的快速发展，船舶和货物在战乱地区的风险日益凸显。第一次世界大战期间，大量商船被击沉或扣押，促使保险公司开发出专门的战争险产品以应对此类风险。此后，随着全球政治局势的变化和恐怖主义的兴起，战争险的范围逐渐扩大至包括恐怖袭击和其他非传统军事威胁。  
  **English Explanation**: The origin of War Risk Insurance can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries during Europe's industrialization period. With the rapid growth of international trade and shipping, the risks faced by vessels and cargo in conflict zones became increasingly apparent. During World War I, numerous merchant ships were sunk or seized, prompting insurance companies to develop specialized war risk products to address these challenges. Since then, as global political dynamics evolved and terrorism emerged, the scope of War Risk Insurance has expanded to include terrorist attacks and other non-traditional military threats.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文解释**：战争风险保险对全球贸易和航运业产生了深远影响。它不仅为企业在高风险地区的运营提供了保障，还推动了国际物流和供应链的稳定发展。例如，“9·11”事件后，许多保险公司将恐怖主义纳入战争险的承保范围，进一步增强了企业的风险管理能力。目前，随着地缘政治风险的增加（如中东局势紧张），战争险的需求持续上升，成为全球风险管理体系的重要组成部分。  
  **English Explanation**: War Risk Insurance has had a profound impact on global trade and the shipping industry. It not only provides security for businesses operating in high-risk regions but also promotes the stable development of international logistics and supply chains. For instance, after the September 11 attacks, many insurers included terrorism within the coverage of War Risk Insurance, further enhancing corporate risk management capabilities. Currently, with increasing geopolitical risks (e.g., tensions in the Middle East), demand for War Risk Insurance continues to rise, making it a vital component of the global risk management system.
