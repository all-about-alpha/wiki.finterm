# Whole Loan

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 全贷款（Whole Loan）是指金融机构将一笔完整的贷款直接出售给投资者或另一家金融机构，而不是将其分割成证券化产品（如抵押贷款支持证券）。这种交易方式保留了贷款的原始结构和条款，买方获得贷款的全部权益和风险。  
  **English Explanation**: A Whole Loan refers to the sale of an entire loan by a financial institution directly to an investor or another financial institution, rather than securitizing it into products like mortgage-backed securities.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: 全贷款通常应用于房地产融资、企业贷款等领域。投资者通过购买全贷款可以获得稳定的现金流，但同时也需承担借款人违约的风险。在房地产市场繁荣时期，全贷款交易较为活跃；而在经济下行时，违约风险增加，交易量可能减少。
