# Withholding Allowance

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：预扣免税额是指纳税人在计算工资所得税时，根据个人情况（如家庭负担、赡养人数等）申请的一定金额的免税额度。该额度用于减少雇主从员工工资中预扣的所得税金额，从而增加员工的实得工资。  
  **English Explanation**: A withholding allowance is a specific amount of income that an employee can claim to be exempt from income tax withholding on their paycheck. This allowance is based on personal circumstances, such as family dependents or other financial obligations, and it reduces the amount of tax withheld by the employer, thereby increasing the employee's take-home pay.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：预扣免税额通常由员工在入职时填写W-4表格（美国）或类似税务表格时申报。员工需要根据自身情况（如婚姻状况、子女数量等）合理申报免税额，以确保每月预扣的税款与实际应缴税款相符。如果申报过多，可能导致年底补税；如果申报过少，则可能影响日常现金流。  
  **English Application**: Employees typically claim withholding allowances when completing forms like the W-4 (in the U.S.) or similar tax documents upon starting a job. The number of allowances claimed should reflect personal circumstances (e.g., marital status, number of dependents) to ensure that the amount withheld aligns with actual tax liability. Overclaiming may result in owing taxes at year-end, while underclaiming can reduce monthly cash flow.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**：预扣免税额在个人所得税管理中起到关键作用，帮助纳税人合理规划税务负担，避免因预扣过多或过少而导致的财务问题。对于雇主而言，正确计算和扣除税款也是合规经营的重要环节。  
  **English Significance**: Withholding allowances play a crucial role in personal income tax management, helping taxpayers plan their tax liabilities effectively and avoid financial issues caused by over- or under-withholding. For employers, accurately calculating and withholding taxes is also a key aspect of compliance.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：预扣免税额的概念起源于20世纪初的美国所得税制度。1913年，美国通过第16条宪法修正案，正式确立了联邦所得税制度。随着税收制度的完善，1943年《现行税收支付法案》（Current Tax Payment Act）引入了工资税预扣机制，并逐步发展出预扣免税额的概念。  
  **English Origin**: The concept of withholding allowances originated in the early 20th century with the U.S. federal income tax system. The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913, established federal income tax.

* **影响 / Impact**
