  **English Application Scenarios**: Warranties are widely used in consumer goods, electronics, automobiles, and home appliances. For example, when purchasing a smartphone, retailers often provide a one-year limited warranty covering repairs for non-manufacturing defects. Consumers should be aware of exclusions in warranty terms, such as damage caused by misuse or improper handling.
