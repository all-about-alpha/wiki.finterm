  **中文解释**：Whitemail（白邮件）是一种反收购策略，指目标公司通过向潜在的收购方发行新股或其他证券，以稀释收购方的股权比例，从而增加收购难度和成本。这一策略通常在公司面临敌意收购时使用，目的是保护公司现有管理层和股东的利益。  
  **English Explanation**: Whitemail is an anti-takeover strategy where the target company issues new shares or other securities to potential acquirers, diluting their ownership stake and thereby increasing the difficulty and cost of the acquisition.

  **English Application Scenarios**: The whitemail strategy is often used by publicly traded companies facing hostile takeovers, issuing new shares or convertible bonds to dilute the acquirer's ownership stake.

However, this approach may lead to shareholder dissatisfaction or legal disputes.
