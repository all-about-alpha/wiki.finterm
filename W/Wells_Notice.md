## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**：Wells Notice（威尔斯通知）是美国证券交易委员会（SEC）向个人或公司发出的一种正式通知，告知其可能面临执法行动。该通知通常表明SEC已初步决定对接收者提起民事诉讼或行政诉讼，并给予接收者回应的机会。  
  **English Explanation**: A Wells Notice is a formal notification issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to an individual or company, indicating that the SEC has preliminarily decided to bring an enforcement action against them.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：Wells Notice通常用于证券监管领域，当SEC发现潜在违反证券法的行为时，会向相关方发出通知。接收者可以通过提交书面陈述（Wells Submission）来回应指控，试图说服SEC放弃或减轻处罚。风险在于，如果未能有效回应，可能面临正式诉讼或罚款。  
  **English Application**: Wells Notices are commonly used in securities regulation. When the SEC identifies potential violations of securities laws, it issues the notice to the relevant parties.
