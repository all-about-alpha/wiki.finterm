## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: 加权平均评级因子（WARF）是一种用于衡量投资组合信用风险的指标，由穆迪投资者服务公司（Moody's Investors Service）开发。它通过将投资组合中每个债券的信用评级转换为对应的违约概率，并按其市场价值进行加权平均计算得出。核心概念在于将信用评级量化为数值，以便更直观地评估整体风险。  
  **English Explanation**: The Weighted Average Rating Factor (WARF) is a metric developed by Moody's Investors Service to measure the credit risk of an investment portfolio. It converts the credit rating of each bond in the portfolio into a corresponding default probability and calculates a weighted average based on their market values. The core concept lies in quantifying credit ratings into numerical values for a more intuitive assessment of overall risk.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文解释**: WARF广泛应用于金融机构和资产管理公司，用于评估固定收益投资组合的信用风险。例如，在管理债券基金或结构化金融产品时，WARF帮助投资者识别潜在的高风险资产并优化资产配置。需要注意的是，WARF依赖于信用评级的准确性，因此在市场波动或评级机构调整评级时可能产生偏差。  
  **English Explanation**: WARF is widely used by financial institutions and asset management companies to assess the credit risk of fixed-income portfolios. For instance, when managing bond funds or structured financial products, WARF helps investors identify potentially high-risk assets and optimize asset allocation. It is important to note that WARF relies on the accuracy of credit ratings, which may lead to deviations during market volatility or rating agency adjustments.
