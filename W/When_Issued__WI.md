# When Issued (WI)

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**  
  “When Issued”（简称 WI）是指证券在正式发行前，投资者可以在二级市场上进行交易的一种机制。这种交易通常发生在证券已经获得监管机构批准但尚未正式发行的阶段。WI 交易的核心概念是“预期交易”，即买卖双方基于对证券未来发行的预期进行交易。  
  **English Explanation**  
  "When Issued" (abbreviated as WI) refers to a mechanism that allows investors to trade securities in the secondary market before they are officially issued. This type of trading typically occurs after the securities have been approved by regulatory authorities but before their formal issuance. The core concept of WI trading is "anticipatory trading," where buyers and sellers transact based on expectations of the securities' future issuance.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**  
  WI 交易主要应用于债券、股票或其他金融工具的发行前阶段。投资者可以通过 WI 交易提前锁定价格或对冲风险，但需注意 WI 交易存在不确定性，因为证券最终可能因监管或其他原因未能发行。此外，WI 交易的结算通常在证券正式发行后进行。  
  **English Application**  
  WI trading is primarily used in the pre-issuance phase of bonds, stocks, or other financial instruments. Investors can use WI trading to lock in prices or hedge risks in advance. However, it is important to note that WI trading carries uncertainty, as the securities may ultimately not be issued due to regulatory or other reasons. Additionally, settlement for WI trades typically occurs after the securities are officially issued.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**  
  从监管角度看，WI 交易为市场提供了流动性，并帮助发行人测试市场需求。从投资角度看，它为投资者提供了提前参与市场的机会，但也带来了额外的风险。从行业角度看，WI 交易是资本市场成熟度的重要标志，反映了市场对金融工具定价和风险管理的精细化需求。  
  **English Significance**  
  From a regulatory perspective, WI trading provides liquidity to the market and helps issuers gauge market demand. From an investment perspective, it offers investors the opportunity to participate in the market early but also introduces additional risks. From an industry perspective, WI trading is a significant indicator of capital market maturity, reflecting the market's refined needs for pricing financial instruments and managing risks.
