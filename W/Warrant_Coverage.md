# Warrant Coverage

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

  **English Explanation**: Warrant Coverage refers to the ratio of the number of warrants issued by a company to the number of its outstanding shares.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用场景**：认股权证覆盖率常用于初创企业或成长型企业的融资过程中，作为吸引投资者的工具。高覆盖率可能意味着公司未来有较大的股本稀释风险，但也可能表明公司对自身增长潜力的信心。投资者需注意覆盖率的合理性，以避免过度稀释带来的投资风险。  
  **English Application**: Warrant Coverage is often used in financing rounds for startups or growth-stage companies as a tool to attract investors. A high coverage ratio may indicate significant future equity dilution but also reflects the company's confidence in its growth potential. Investors should assess the reasonableness of the coverage ratio to avoid risks associated with excessive dilution.
