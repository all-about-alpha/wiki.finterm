  War Damage Insurance is a specialized insurance product designed to provide financial compensation for property damage or personal injury caused by war, military actions, or terrorist attacks. This type of insurance is typically offered by insurance companies or government agencies and covers property losses such as buildings, equipment, and inventory, as well as business interruption losses due to war.

## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**  
  战争损害保险的起源可以追溯到20世纪初的第一次世界大战。当时，欧洲各国在战争中遭受了巨大的财产损失，促使保险公司开始设计针对战争风险的保险产品。二战期间，战争损害保险进一步发展，许多国家政府开始介入，提供国家层面的战争保险计划。例如，英国在二战期间推出了“战争风险保险计划”，以保障民用财产免受战争破坏。  
  **English Origin**  
  The origin of War Damage Insurance can be traced back to World War I in the early 20th century. During this period, European countries suffered significant property losses, prompting insurance companies to design products specifically addressing war risks. During World War II, War Damage Insurance further evolved, with many governments stepping in to provide national-level war insurance programs. For example, the UK introduced the "War Risks Insurance Scheme" during WWII to protect civilian property from war-related damage.

* **影响 / Impact**  
  **中文影响**  
  战争损害保险的出现对全球保险业产生了深远影响。它不仅推动了保险产品的创新，还促进了国际合作，特别是在跨国企业和国际投资领域。如今，战争损害保险已成为高风险地区经济活动的重要保障工具。然而，随着战争形式的多样化（如网络战、无人机攻击），战争损害保险也面临新的挑战，需要不断调整和扩展其覆盖范围。  
  **English Impact**  
  The emergence of War Damage Insurance has had a profound impact on the global insurance industry. It has not only driven product innovation but also fostered international cooperation, particularly in the fields of multinational enterprises and international investments. Today, War Damage Insurance is a crucial tool for safeguarding economic activities in high-risk regions. However, with the diversification of warfare (e.g., cyber warfare, drone attacks), War Damage Insurance faces new challenges and must continually adapt and expand its coverage.
