## 历史典故 / Historical Context

* **起源 / Origin**  
  **中文起源**：  
  “巫术时刻”一词最早出现在20世纪80年代的美国金融市场，当时期权和期货交易逐渐普及。由于每季度末大量合约同时到期，市场出现异常波动，投资者形象地将其称为“巫术时刻”。这一现象随着衍生品市场的扩张而愈发显著。  
  **English Origin**：  
  The term "Witching Hour" first emerged in the U.S. financial markets in the 1980s as options and futures trading gained popularity. With numerous contracts expiring simultaneously at the end of each quarter, abnormal market volatility led investors to coin this term metaphorically. The phenomenon has become more pronounced with the expansion of derivative markets.
