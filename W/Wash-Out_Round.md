# Wash-Out Round

## 中文解释 / English Explanation

* **定义 / Definition**  
  **中文解释**: Wash-Out Round（清洗轮融资）是指在一轮融资中，新投资者以极低的价格购买公司股份，导致现有股东的股权被大幅稀释，甚至可能完全失去其股份价值。这种融资通常发生在公司面临严重财务困境或估值大幅下降时。  
  **English Explanation**: A Wash-Out Round refers to a financing round in which new investors purchase company shares at a significantly low price, leading to substantial dilution of existing shareholders' equity, potentially rendering their shares worthless. This type of financing typically occurs when a company is in severe financial distress or has experienced a significant decline in valuation.

* **应用 / Application**  
  **中文应用**: Wash-Out Round常见于初创企业或陷入财务危机的公司。在这种情况下，公司可能无法通过传统融资渠道获得资金，只能接受新投资者的苛刻条件。现有股东（如创始团队和早期投资者）可能会因此遭受重大损失。风险包括股权稀释、控制权丧失以及公司未来发展的不确定性。  
  **English Application**: Wash-Out Rounds are commonly seen in startups or companies facing financial crises. In such scenarios, the company may be unable to secure funding through traditional channels and must accept stringent terms from new investors. Existing shareholders (e.g., founding teams and early investors) may suffer significant losses as a result. Risks include equity dilution, loss of control, and uncertainty about the company's future development.

* **重要性 / Significance**  
  **中文重要性**: 从监管角度看，Wash-Out Round可能引发对投资者保护的关注；从投资角度看，它反映了市场对公司前景的悲观预期；从行业角度看，这种融资方式可能导致资源重新分配，影响行业竞争格局。  
  **English Significance**: From a regulatory perspective, Wash-Out Rounds may raise concerns about investor protection; from an investment perspective, they reflect market pessimism about the company's prospects; from an industry perspective, this financing method could lead to resource reallocation and impact competitive dynamics.
